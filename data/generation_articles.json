Butts and Robyn WindFebruary 05, 2025TagsInnovation & Social ImpactEconomic SecurityEquity & JusticeAbstractEngaging people with lived experience needs to be intentional and supported to be effective. For more than 10 years, Generations Uniteds GRAND Voices Network has demonstrated the power and impact of meaningful engagement changing public policy and service delivery systems across the country. This article outlines essential components of a high quality lived experience program and the results of these programs.Key WordsLived experience, grandfamilies, advocacy, kinship care, engagement, equityLong before people with lived experience were commonly referenced, Generations United committed to the concept of nothing about us without us. Lived experience means knowledge based upon someones perspective, personal identities, and history, beyond their professional or educational experience (Guerrero Ramirez et al., 2022). African American, Native American, and Native Alaskan people are disproportionately represented in the grandparents with whom we work for numerous reasons, including cultural strength and institutional racism.Grandparents and other relatives raising children (i.e., grandfamilies, kinship care) were always at our table, but we knew their experience was critical for policies and programs to truly support their families. We wanted to formalize the value of this lived experience, provide training and support to the caregivers, and grow a strong national network. In 2014 we began with representatives from five statesnow we have GRANDs, as we call them, in more than 46 states and 13 tribes. They are integral to our work and advocacy assets bar none.Its a reciprocal, respectful partnership. As one GRAND said, I'm very grateful and thankful you have given me this opportunity. I hope to be a light to all I serve.Engaging people with lived experience is key to advancing equity. According to a fact sheet issued by the Health and Human Services assistant secretary for planning and evaluation, three elements are essential. First, strive for true partnerships by engaging people meaningfully. Second, meaningfully and collaboratively inform decisions about those most affected by the programs or policy. Third, improve equitable outcomes by developing these so they meet peoples needs and improve access so they can realize their full potential (Guerrero Ramirez et al., 2022).The GRANDs are compensated for their work.Members of the GRAND Voices Network are recruited to represent their state or tribe. They submit a profile and statement about why they want to be a part of the network. They are then screened by the GRAND Voices support coordinator, and if accepted, they receive training and support that enables them to tell their stories in a way that strategically considers how to connect with their audience while considering the impact of story sharing on themselves and their family members. This is important because it can be traumatic to relive pain and struggles. It is imperative for GRANDS to set their individual boundaries.GRANDs are compensated for their work. They receive a stipend when they serve on advisory boards, testify, or in other ways share their stories and opinions in an official capacity as a GRAND Voice. Their travel is paid for, and funding is provided for childcare if they still have children that need care. These funds are provided by Casey Family Programs or the entity requesting their assistance. This is critical to their ability to participate and also affirms the value of their important role.The GRAND Voices support coordinator and other staff at Generations Uniteds National Center on Grandfamilies screen requests for GRAND involvement. If greenlighted, the coordinator then identifies several GRANDs whose experience and profile match the request. Once a GRAND agrees, they are supported while they prepare for the engagement. This includes coaching on their remarks and logistics to support the engagement. After they complete the engagement, the coordinator debriefs the experience with them.GRAND Voices have spoken at Capitol Hill briefings, met with staff of members of Congress and key Congressional committees, addressed White House convenings, testified before Congress, met with local and national media, and provided input on proposed legislation, draft publications, and essential data collection tools. Our network is invaluable in providing important feedback for our work and assisting us with technical assistance requests from programs, states, and tribes.Examples of their impact are abundant. In 2017, GRAND Gail Gallagher from Texas represented Generations United on a panel about the opioid crisis during the National Association of Counties conference. The audience included more than 50 county leaders and elected officials. Reporting on her presentation, her fellow panelist said, It was SO POWERFUL! She had everyone in the room captivated.Early in 2023, GRAND Victoria Gray testified before the House Subcommittee on Work & Welfare at a hearing titled Welfare is Broken: Restoring Work Requirements to Lift Americans Out of Poverty. She testified about Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and how proposed work requirements would be unfair to grandfamilies. Her testimony led to praise across the aisle including near the end of the hearing when Rep. Wenstrup (R-OH) said about the witnesses, You are all wonderful people, but Ms. Gray, I dont think I have met a living saint in my life, but you are right up there.Being a GRAND Voice is like having a PhD. People like titles. It tells them I do know something, and they listen.Because grandfamilies are so diverse, we committed to intentionally increasing the diversity among our GRAND Voices Network. In 2014, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation funded our race equity work. This enabled us to focus on underserved and disproportionately under-represented Native American and African American grandfamilies. We collaborated with the National Indian Child Welfare Association and A Second Chance Inc. to recruit GRANDs and create race equity toolkits for the systems that impact the families. One of the GRANDs recruited through this project said, The Grand Voices Network is a great support and blessing to my family. I know it will have major impact beyond our time together. I'm so grateful to be a part of this community. Miigwech. (Thank you in Ojibwe.)GRANDs also help keep things real. Theyve given us practical advice on how federal policies like the Family First Prevention Services Act should be implemented locally to effectively serve grandfamilies. They gave guidance on how to best collaborate with state child welfare agencies around federal kinship navigator opportunities so they would be better designed to serve the needs of the caregivers and the children.GRAND Voice Adrian Charniak said, Being a GRAND Voice is like having a PhD. People like titles. It tells them I do know something, and they listen.She said it also offers her and other GRANDs a bond with people across the country, it connects you and lets the love that you have for your family travel to another family. Its a group of caring people helping each other.We understand each GRAND is unique. And many of the GRANDs, especially if they are still raising children, live very complex lives. They may face a personal crisis and need to step back.As GRAND Voice Antoinette James noted, There is a growing need for targeted support for grandparents who are younger than 55 and raising grandchildren. These caregivers often find themselves in a different set of circumstances than older grandparents, including balancing their careers, raising younger children of their own, or facing financial pressures. A fair number have health issues and face decline in their ability to participate.Life happens, and one thing weve learned is to never, ever underestimate the strength and resiliency of a GRAND.Donna Butts is executive director of Generations United, in Washington, DC, Robyn Wind is its GRAND Voices support coordinator, and holds tribal citizenship with the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.Photo caption: Victoria Gray, left, is a Generations United GRAND Voice from Arizona, pictured with Rep.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202425Keeping Families Together Via Better Guardianship RulesBy Deirdre M. SmithFebruary 05, 2025TagsEquity & JusticeAgeism & CultureInnovation & Social ImpactAbstractIn many BIPOC families, children spend significant periods under their grandparents or other relatives care. Minor guardianship can be an important legal mechanism, giving caregivers the legal status needed to serve as a substitute parent and provide stability for grandchildren, while avoiding the risks and uncertainty of the public child protection system. Too few families use this tool because state guardianship laws include outdated provisions and court processes are challenging to navigate, especially for caregivers with no access to legal help. State policymakers should examine and reform minor guardianship laws to ensure they serve the needs of children, families, and courts.Key Wordsminor guardianship, BIPOC grandparents, relatives, stability, caregivers, legal helpAs contributors to this issue describe, a substantial number of BIPOC children are raised primarily by a non-parent relative caregiver, most commonly a grandparent. The Annie E. Casey Foundation (2023) found that, as of 2021, 3.7 million children in the U.S. (about 5% of all U.S. children) lived in households without parents as the primary caregivers.Children commonly come to live with relative caregivers when a parent is facing a crisis due to substance use, homelessness, mental or other illness, or incarceration (Duques, 2005; Gleeson et al., 2009). Grandparents are the go-to resource for many families where a parent cannot provide care, and the practice of grandparents raising children is particularly prevalent in families of color (Berrick & Hernandez, 2016; Pittman, 2023). Studies have identified reasons for this disproportionate reliance upon relative caregiving in BIPOC families, including criminal justice policies and mass incarceration, the HIV/AIDS and crack cocaine epidemics, poverty, and state child welfare interventions (Pittman, 2023).Relative caregiving arrangements may be brief, depending on the familys needs, but research indicates that children under a grandparents care remain for longer periods of time than those living with other relatives (Government Accountability Office, 2020; Radel et al., 2016). Many of these non-parent caregivers lack the legal authority they need to meet the childs needs. The legal relationship between grandparents and the children in their care can fall anywhere on a spectrum of informal (i.e., no legal documentation of caregiver status) to formal (e.g., legal adoption) arrangements (Pittman, 2023).Minor guardianship, also known as probate guardianship, falls somewhere in the middle. It confers many of the rights and responsibilities of parents, such as the ability to enroll a child in school and obtain medical care, and it assigns the guardian the duty to provide a home and care for the child (Hardin, 1983). Once the relative is appointed as guardian, they generally retain these rights and responsibilities unless the court terminates or modifies the order (Smith, 2019).Guardianship laws have their origins in colonial law, created at a time when the children for whom courts appointed guardians were predominantly legal orphans, incapacitated by their youth, who had inherited property (Taylor, 1935). For this reason, these laws fall under probate lawlaws about property transfer upon a persons death. Guardianship proceedings often take place in probate courts rather than family courts (Smith, 2019).Today, however, very few children are orphaned, and guardianships are rarely needed to ensure appropriate management of a childs property. Instead, the laws are mostly used to address a childs need for care when a living parent is in a crisis or context that limits their abilityat least temporarilyto provide such care (Huntington, 2014; Smith, 2019).The use of guardianships for this purpose originated in observations and proposals published in the 20th century by social work scholars (Leashore, 1984; Taylor, 1966; Weissman, 1949). As the child welfare and foster care systems expanded, these scholars urged consideration of guardianships as an alternative to foster care and adoption to preserve familial ties while ensuring care and stability for the child (Smith, 2019). The shift to using guardianship as an alternative to foster care was also facilitated by public child welfare agencies aiming to reduce their caseloads. Through a practice sometimes referred to as kinship diversion, families were encouraged or instructed to pursue minor guardianship (Office of the Child Advocate, 2009; Smith, 2019).Guardianship Presents a Trade-off for BIPOC FamiliesToday, two distinct legal mechanismspublic child welfare (or dependency) and private guardianshipare used in similar contexts and based on similar concerns. However, these can lead to vastly different results for families in the short and long term. One set of disparities reflects the different historical origins of minor guardianship from laws governing dependency proceedings. In theory, federal and state laws governing public child welfare make reunifying parents and children a primary goal and responsibility of child protective services (CPS) agencies (McGowen, 2005).Through kinship diversion, families were encouraged or instructed to pursue minor guardianship.In discharging those responsibilities, CPS agencies may provide the family services and financial support (Hardin, 1983; Huntington, 2014; Weisz & McCormick, 2003). In recent years, such agencies have recognized that children in state custody should, whenever possible, be placed with relatives rather than foster familiesa practice known as kinship placementto minimize trauma and facilitate reunification with their parents (Testa & Miller, 2005).Minor guardianship laws have a different purpose: to authorize a person to act as a childs substitute parent. Such aim reflects guardianships colonial origins as a legal mechanism, based in probate laws and courts, to appoint a fiduciary to oversee the property and person of an individual regarded as being incapacitated. Such arrangements needed to be comprehensive and long-term; there was no expectation that the arrangement would be temporary, or that the child would be reunified with the parent. The antiquated provisions of many states minor guardianship laws fail to equip courts with the authority and guidance necessary to effectively address the interests of children, their parents, and their relative caregivers under todays prevailing conditions (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2023; Smith, 2019).This disparity may lead one to conclude that guardianship is a disadvantageous option for families when compared with the public child welfare system. However, when we consider the perspective of the families receiving the most scrutiny from public child welfare agencies, particularly BIPOC families, we see the alternatives in terms of a very different sense of risks and benefits.Families at the margins rather than centers of power are understandably wary of the help public child welfare agencies provide. While there are deep roots for kinship care practices in many cultures and societies, interfamilial care has had a particularly important role in African American communities. In these and other communities of color, the self-sufficient nuclear family has never been set as the ideal for a household or childrearing configuration (Berrick & Hernandez, 2016; Coupet, 2010; Roberts, 2002). Challenges presented to families in these communities by economic, social, and political pressures often obliged them to look within their kinship networksa rich system of interdependence, as Coupet (2010) called itfor assistance and support (Gleeson et al., 2009; Leashore, 1984).And in fact, for generations families in these communities have employed their own child protection systems. They have done so in part to avoid any engagement with the government because the risks are multifold, substantial, and pose real threats to their survival as families. As noted and documented by many scholars, the broad definitions of abuse, neglect, and parental unfitness employed in the child welfare system allow CPS workers to apply them to family arrangements that fall outside tacit social norms often shaped by biased assumptions about race, culture, religion, gender, disability, and class (Guggenheim, 2000; Huntington, 2014). Such biases can be reflected in how agencies target families for disruption and dissolution rather than support and reunification (Huntington, 2014; Roberts, 2002).For some BIPOC communities, the bar for government intervention has been shockingly low. The experience of Native American families that led in 1978 to the enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) is perhaps the starkest and most tragic example of the effect of these biased social norms. Thousands of Indigenous children were removed from their families based upon the assumption that they needed to be rescued from conditions seen as inferior and exposed to the majority culture to ensure they would be able to assimilate and succeed in the majority society (Roberts, 2002). The widespread practice was halted and remains in check only by Congresss enactment of ICWA (1978).More recently, figures on the racial makeup of the families from whom children have been removed by the state reveal serious disparities and inequities, with African American families as the overwhelming majority of CPS caseloads in urban communities (Huntington, 2014; Roberts, 2002). Roberts (2002) described the foster care system in the nations cities as an apartheid institution (pp. 610). The nebulous conceptualization of parental unfitness leaves much to the discretion of caseworkers. Actions and conduct that would be considered unremarkable in middle- and upper-class White familiessuch as alcohol and drug useand that fall far short of physical abuse or abandonment, serve as grounds for removal of the children in poor, urban families (Huntington, 2014; Roberts, 2012).Under this approach to parental unfitness, other relatives in the family may be considered not as resources for alternative care but rather as part of the problem from which children need to be removedthe apple doesnt fall far from the tree assumption. As was true of immigrant families in urban settings at the turn of the century and of Native American tribal members for decades after that, marginalized groups have always been particularly vulnerable to intervention (Huntington, 2014). Instead of permitting children in such communities to be cared for by other family members, CPS workers plucked them from this worrisome element and placed them in overcrowded institutions or with foster families far different from their own (Huntington, 2014).In short, families of color and low-income families have long had good reasons to take care of problems within the family (Gleeson et al., 2009; Huntington, 2014). Given that there are clear reasons to address a parents caregiving crisis within the family structure with minimal interference or involvement from the state, it is all the more important that families pursuing private child protection are well-served by the laws that provide an alternative, such as minor guardianship.The nebulous conceptualization of parental unfitness leaves much to the discretion of caseworkers.Appointment of a relative caregiver as a legal guardian can stave off public agency involvement in the family, including the placement of the child in foster care, enabling the family to control the childs care. Guardian appointments ensure that the relative who becomes the caregiver can enroll the child in school and gain access to essential services like healthcare (Berrick & Hernandez, 2014; Duques, 2005; Gupta-Kagen, 2008; Uniform Law Commission, 2017). Guardianship also can provide stability for the child by preventing a troubled parent from simply demanding to resume custody, as can occur under informal arrangements.Some scholars such as Bogart Leashore (1984) have advocated for the increased use of guardianship, specifically emphasizing the potential benefits for African American families. He also noted in his research in the 1980s that significant numbers of childrenparticularly children of colorwho had been removed from their parents homes via CPS intervention were not likely to return to those homes or to be adopted into other families. He observed that familial bonds are not easily broken and that the emotional impact on children of removal from their families was often severe (Leashore, 1984). Similarly, Carol Williams (1992) found that guardianship complements the social and cultural reality of many African American children (p. 277).By the same token, however, guardianship proceedings implicate questions of child welfare and parental rights. The guardianship order effectively suspends a parents rights, and, when a courts appointment of a guardian is made over a parents objection, it infringes on the parents fundamental liberty interest in parenting their children (Guardianship of Sebastien, 2024).Also, because guardianship is understood to be private, therefore outside of the public child welfare system, once a guardianship appointment is made, and even if the agency is aware of concerns about possible neglect, a public child welfare agency will provide little, if any, assistance to the family (Malm & Geen, 2003). This means the parent and child do not have access to formally supervised paths to reunification or the critical public services and supports such families often need to help them reach it.Guardianship laws can be rigid. Rather than encouraging court orders that meet specific family needs and circumstances, these laws lead courts to appoint guardians who have complete and indefinite rights over the childs well-being, leaving no role for the parent. Broad, permanent orders make sense if a child is orphaned or the parent is otherwise permanently out of the picture, but in other circumstances, they can undermine any chance for future reunification between a child and a living parent (Smith, 2019).Although most parents in crisis consent to a guardians appointment, they often do not realize the drastic consequences. A parent cannot resume custody of the child simply by revoking their consent, even if they have addressed the crisis that led to the appointment. Instead, if the relative does not agree to give up custody, the parent must petition the court to terminate the guardianship. This can result in contentious, emotional, and expensive litigation. Thus, overly rigid and outdated guardianship laws can result in severe and lasting costs to the families (Smith, 2019).The Pew Charitable Trusts (2023) recently conducted an extensive review of minor guardianship laws and their use throughout the United States. Its report, Outdated Court Policies Can Leave Children Without a Legal Guardian, included these findings:Despite the significant number of relatives caring for children, few seek minor guardianship orders;Most state courts do not provide easily understandable information about minor guardianship as an option for relative caregivers;Minor guardianship cases are too often heard in probate courts rather than family courts; andGuardianship orders often fail to clearly define the rights and responsibilities of guardians and the minors parents (The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2023).States Should Enact Reforms to Reflect Contemporary UsesAny form of child protectionwhether public or privateshould preserve kinship ties while ensuring childrens safety and stability. Minor guardianship laws and procedures must be reformed to serve this goal and ensure that they do not further harm families dealing with or recovering from crises. Specifically, guardianship today should be unlinked from probate law and reworked to enable and encourage courts to address specific family needs and facilitate possible future reunifications of parents and children.Some states have enacted innovative reforms to ensure that their guardianship laws respond to the needs of courts, children, and families today. For example, Iowa, Maine, Wisconsin, and Vermont studied the contemporary uses of minor guardianship and overhauled their statutes accordingly (The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2023). Key reforms enacted by these states include:Requiring appointment orders address what role, if any, the parent will have in the childs life during the guardianshipaddressing issues about visitation, access to information, child support, and decision-making;Ensuring that parents are informed of guardianships implications before consenting;Granting courts the authority to modify a guardianship order after the appointment is in place to ensure it reflects the changing needs of the family; andEnsuring that guardianship cases are heard in the same court system as other family law cases rather than in probate courts (The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2023).Pews 2023 report included a series of recommendations to policymakers, focused on examining both the statutes and the court procedures to implement them. In addition to reforming laws, Pew urged states to consider the following actions:Collect and examine court data about minor guardianship and the families who use this mechanism;Provide clear information for relative caregivers who may want to pursue guardianship about the range of legal options for caregiving and how to pursue guardianship if they elect that option; andEstablish affordable routes to provide notice to the childs parents (The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2023).States also must ensure relative caregivers, parents, and children have access to quality, affordable (and free, for those who qualify) legal assistance to make reforms to laws and processes most effective and to ensure basic fairness in guardianship proceedings.Finally, states also can better serve kinship care families by extending family support and reunification services to the families that pursue guardianship. Although crises that give rise to a guardianship may prove temporaryfor example, if a parent eventually overcomes substance abuse problemsmany families in crisis need professional support such as family counseling, parent education, supervised visitation, substance use treatment, and other targeted measures.Assistance provided by public agencies should not be reserved just for families with children in state custody; in fact, help for relative caregivers can prevent the need for state intervention later. Under the Family First Prevention Services Act (2018), Congress extended federal funding for state services to kinship care families. State policymakers should take advantage of these resources as they follow the states that have instituted legal reforms to preserve and support families in crisis.BIPOC families use of kinship caregiving and minor guardianship to address a childs need for care and safety reflects the risks and inadequacies of the public child welfare system and the broader societal problems that can lead to instability in large numbers of families. In recent decades, these problems included war, migration, poverty, mass incarceration, opioid use, and widespread illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and COVID. It has never been more important for policymakers to ensure that all families and the institutions that serve them are equipped to provide children the care they need and to provide parents the support, tools, and compassion they need to remain in their childrens lives.Deirdre M.

Yet too many skip-generation households must navigate care within the constraints of poverty and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). They are called upon and expected to do more with less. This article discusses the importance of understanding the impact of poverty on essential caregivers in our society, and the reciprocity of care between grandchildren and grandparents. The author calls for rejecting the overreliance on resilience and the philosophy of providing just enough help for these caregivers to make ends meet.Key WordsAdverse Childhood Experiences, African Americans, grandfamilies, grandparent caregivers, povertyPoverty among African Americans is a significant opportunity barrier. While there have been successful strides made to reduce poverty, it remains persistent and disproportionally impacts African American skip-generation households. This article addresses the overlapping conditions of being a caregiver and lacking adequate financial resources to address the needs of minor children and the adults who are their caregivers.It is important to begin this discussion by acknowledging the strengths of grandparent caregiver households. When birth parents cannot carry out their responsibilities, grandparents often step in to provide care for family members. Conversely, when grandparents in skip-generation households need care, their minor grandchildren step in.This mutual support system fills gaps that structural inequalities have created and fail to adequately address. The unique challenges faced by African American skip-generation households, as highlighted by Peterson (2018), underscore the need for targeted solutions.This article delves into how poverty continues to be a driving force in these households and elevates awareness of poverty as a persistent structural inequality.The Strengths of Grandparent (Skip-Generation) CaregiversSkip-generation households are families where a child lives with at least one grandparent but no parent. Often the terms grandfamilies or grandparent-headed households are used interchangeably to describe this family type. Generations United uses the terms Grandfamilies and kinship families interchangeably to refer to families in which grandparents, other adult relatives, or close family friends raise children whose parents are unable to do so. In this article, I also use the terms interchangeably. Whichever term is used, it is important to personalize and particularize the relationship of grandparent-headed households.Skip-generation families, despite their challenges, have positive and reciprocal benefits for grandchildren and their caregivers. Hayslip et al. (2017) reported that one of the lessons learned over the past decade has been the critical impact of the strengths of grandparents in caregiver roles. Often couched in terms of resilience, the positive outcomes of skip-generation families include greater closeness to grandchildren when compared to non-caregivers (Fuller-Thompson & Minkler, 2001), comparable health outcomes of children (Solomon & Marx, 1995), and family stability (Minkler & Roe, 1996).Using principles of the Howard University Black Perspective (Howard University School of Social Work, 2024), affirming and acknowledging strengths is important as we navigate the challenges of these unique family structures. According to Hayslip and Kaminski (2005), documentation suggests children raised by grandparents have better school performance, rely less on welfare, have more autonomy in decision-making, and have fewer deviant behaviors than children in single-parent families. It is also noted that custodial grandparents provide emotional support and structure for grandchildren who might otherwise be in a foster care home. Further, grandparents can pass on their memories, wisdom, stories, and family history to grandchildren, who may feel nurtured, safe, and valued in family connections with grandparents (Tang et al., 2015).When focusing on African Americans, it is important to consider the fluidity of roles (Dariotis et al., 2023) and functional adaptations to the history of oppression, institutional racism, and the close relationship between economic deprivation of Black families and economic affluence for a large percentage of the nation (Freeman, 1990, p. 55). These adaptations are often referred to as the strengths perspective and/or resilience. In qualitative studies such as AARPs on the experience of African-American grandmothers, Crewe and Stowell-Ritter (2013) stated:Being a grandparent caregiver in the District of Columbia is not easy. Yet, many grandparents have overcome staggering obstacles and have made a positive difference in the lives of their grandchildren. Reflecting on the unique socio-historical experiences of African Americans and their history of strong family ties, these grandparents are carrying on this positive legacy. Despite the changing times and circumstances surrounding their role as grandparent caregivers, they carry on the family responsibility with great expectations that they will make a difference (p. 37).Grandchildren can feel nurtured, safe, and valued in family connections with grandparents.Numerous high-profile examples celebrate the outcomes of grandchildren who were raised by their grandparents. Simone Biles, the highly celebrated U.S. gymnast, proudly attributes her success to her grandparents and upbringing, which set her up for a better life (Tremaine, 2024). Other well-known personalities such as Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey had influential grandparents in their lives.As noted earlier, there is reciprocity of caregiving between grandchildren and grandparents. Some minor grandchildren serve as caregivers for their grandparents who need care due to age and/or disability. Although exact numbers are unknown, AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving (2020) estimates state that 5.4 million children are caregivers.This reciprocity of caregiving adds another layer of hardship and results in grandchildren carrying an added burden stacked onto other adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). They often miss milestones in their lives because of this parentification, or adultification, which is defined as role reversal where minor children assume responsibilities generally carried out by adults.Such children assume instrumental and emotional support roles to ensure family stability. I am reminded of a grandchild I spoke with who said she had to assume these added responsibilities because if her grandmother could no longer care for her, she would have nowhere to go. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased number of minor children were estimated to become caregivers (Dariotis et al., 2023). And it is well documented that during COVID social determinants resulted in more African Americans having negative health and life outcomes. These negative outcomes cannot be disconnected from poverty.PovertyHard work is the answer. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Tighten your belt. Go to work. Such misinformed solutions to poverty are often heard and passed down, defining a culture of poverty (Small et al., 2010) and penetrating the minds of those not experiencing poverty. Furthermore, when they are used to describe African Americans and other historically oppressed populations, they take on a racist tinge.However, literature is replete with other narratives painting a more balanced picture that steers away from blaming the victim. Barbara Ehrenreichs (2001) Nickel and Dimed provides a counter-narrative about poverty and the intertwining of strengths and hardships. America has always grappled with the impact of poverty. The Freedmens Bureau attempted to bridge the resource gap for recently freed enslaved African Americans via establishing educational institutions, hospitals, and more. Settlement houses focused on addressing this persistent problem in society. And programs enacted by the New Deal attempted to break the cycle of poverty. The War on Poverty also targeted the tenacious hold of poverty, especially for African Americans.Throughout our history, numerous programs have attempted to address the needs of people experiencing poverty, including food stamps, public housing, aid to dependent children, and more. However, almost 250 years after America declared independence, poverty has been reduced but has maintained its harmful effects on too many households, especially those of African Americans and other marginalized groups. Some researchers note that poverty is a pressing public health problem (Hughes & Tucker, 2018), as it creates negative outcomes across a childs life, including into adulthood.Recent data from the United States Census Bureau (2023) documented that 11.5% of Americans are experiencing poverty. Because of racism and structural inequality, 19.5% of African Americans experience poverty. The Census Bureau also documented that 12.4% of children live in poverty. The Brookings Institute asserts that 1 in 8 children lives with a grandparent, and grandparent caregivers have double the rate of poverty when compared with other older persons (Link et al., 2023).According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO, 2020), the grandparent caregiver population differs from the general adult population in several ways. For example, grandparent caregivers are disproportionately female and African American. Additionally, although more than half of the grandparent caregiver population is employed, they are more likely to live in poverty and be out of the labor force as compared to the general adult population. The GAO found that poverty is among the various interrelated factors contributing to hardship among skip-generation households, reporting, Some kin caregivers, particularly in high-poverty areas, may struggle to pay their own bills, and caring for children can increase this financial strain. Some studies in our literature review also found that grandparent caregivers faced challenges generating and shifting income streams later in life and incurred unexpected expenses as a result of taking in their grandchildren (p. 23).Poverty cannot be hiddenit is imperative to highlight its effects on grandparents raising grandchildren. As a society, making ends meet and just getting by cannot be the acceptable standard, nor can lauding the resilience of individuals who avoided falling through the cracks.Reducing poverty cannot be the goal; ending it is essential.Lets look at how the United States measures poverty to better understand this issue. The U.S. Census Bureau uses income to determine poverty (Nicholas & Wiseman, 2009). In the 1960s, Mollie Orshansky of the Social Security Administration defined U.S. poverty by identifying families whose incomes did not cover necessities (Fisher, 1992). In 1969, the federal government adopted the concept of a poverty line (Desmond & Western, 2018), a measure based on 3 times the cost of a minimally nutritious diet. In 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau began using a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) that was better able to identify the effects of federal programs on poverty reduction (Desmond & Western, 2018, p. 307). The SPM is touted to better measure poverty among older households.The official poverty measure defines poverty by comparing pretax income to a poverty threshold adjusted by family size, number of children, and household age. The SPM includes income and payroll taxes, tax credits, and other noncash benefits like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and housing subsidies. Necessary expenses such as child support, childcare, and medical expenses are deducted.Perhaps the title of two books best address poverty in the United States:Poverty in America(Reef, 2007) andPoverty, by America(Desmond, 2023). The terms in and by reveal how we conceptualize poverty. Too often, numbers fail to capture its day-to-day aspects.For example, not cataloged in those numbers is the decision not to purchase needed medication in order to provide clothing for grandchildren, or to use Social Security income to pay higher rent due to space requirements. For African Americans, including an opportunity dimension is critically important due to structural inequalities that have persisted since the enslaved period. This lack of opportunity helps to explain why the poverty rate is higher for African Americans and other minoritized groups. Living below the arbitrary line fails to incorporate the full impact of poverty.In short, poverty is greater than the sum of its partsmany layers often escape the eyes of the public. While these measures are widely used, it is crucial to think of poverty as more than an economic condition. When considering the lived experiences of skip-generation families, it is essential to consider poverty as multidimensional, incorporating the denial of opportunities to live a tolerable life (Desmond & Western, 2018, p. 308). In particular, racism must be considered when addressing African American grandfamilies poverty because of the disparate opportunities sanctioned by historical policies.Childhood PovertyThe Center for American Progress reported almost 11 million children (14.4% of all children) were poor, representing one-third of people living in poverty (Haider, 2021). Moreover, Haider (2021) stated that skip-generation families are more likely to experience poverty than two-parent families, and Black children are twice as likely to live in skip-generation households. The Grand Challenges policy brief addressing extreme economic inequality states explicitly that childhood poverty results in worse health outcomes, reduced productivity, and higher crime rates, costing the U.S. more than $1 trillion per year (American Academy of Social Work, 2024, p. 1).While insightful, it is unlikely that these costs include the emotional burden of caregivers. A particularly relevant construct in thinking about skip-generation households is Adverse Childhood Experiences. ACEs are defined operationally as childhood events, varying in severity and often chronic, occurring in a childs family or social environment that cause harm or distress, thereby disrupting the childs physical or psychological health and development (Kalmakis & Chandler, 2014, p. 1). Also, Hughes and Tucker (2018) stated, Research demonstrates the correlation between childhood adversities linked to poverty and negative outcomes in adulthood, indicating that poverty may itself be considered an adverse childhood experience (p. 124).According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2024), ACEs are potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (from ages 017 years).Examples include:Experiencing violence, abuse, or neglectWitnessing violence in the home or community Having a family member attempt or die by suicideGrowing up in a household with:o Substance use problemso Mental health problems o Instability due to parental separationo Instability due to household members being in jail or prisonThe CDC (2024) noted that other traumatic factors affecting health and well-being also can be categorized as ACEs. For example, not having enough food to eat, experiencing homelessness or unstable housing, or experiencing discrimination, count as ACEs. The CDC also noted that historical and social disparities result in higher rates of ACEs. This again points to the lived experiences of African Americans.They ask for little, and we deliverwe give them too little.In a study of low-income urban youth, participants identified a range of experiences falling into the following 10 domains: family relationships, community stressors, personal victimization, economic hardship, peer relationships, discrimination, school, health, child welfare/juvenile justice, and media/technology (Wade et al., 2014, p. 1). Acknowledging these youth-identified examples broadens and intensifies the identification of ACEs and points to areas that are critically important in the lives of grandchildren raised by grandparents. It is important to note the specific identification of economic hardships associated with their lived experience. Terms like economic instability include poverty, and they also offer academic/euphemistic descriptions that fail to capture the experiences. These often-omitted voices speak to the importance of more inclusivity when we examine issues such as poverty. The lived experience must be the centerpiece of understanding ACEs because the voices of individual experiences do not gloss over their realities.Social Safety Net ProgramsPoverty, ACEs, and race intersect to block opportunities and create environments of getting by rather than thriving. Fortunately, there are safety-net programs grandparents and grandchildren can access to meet their needs. According to the World Bank (2018), safety nets are non-contributory transfer programs generally targeted to the poor or those vulnerable to shocks; including:Cash transfers, targeted or not, conditional or not;Food or other in-kind distribution;Public workfare jobs;General price subsidies, e.g., for food or fuel; andFee waivers for essential services such as health or education.Many safety net programs specifically focus on the needs of skip-generation households. Senior assistance, food stamps, childcare, Medicaid, social security, TANF grants, home improvement grants, college grants, subsidized guardianships, and kinship care are among the resources available to grandparents raising grandchildren (Haney, 2023). Additionally, Growing Family Benefits identifies tax savings opportunities. There are also housing programs designed to support the needs of grandfamilies. These programs are critical and contribute to the safety net. But the 2020 GAO (2020) report Child Welfare and Aging Programs stated that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services can do more to support grandparents and other relatives raising grandchildren. The GAO report made the following two recommendations (p. 50):The Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) should establish an ongoing process to proactively share information and best practices with states about programs it administers that are available to serve kin caregivers, especially in states with a relatively large share of grandparent caregivers. This could be achieved, for example, by leveraging regional office staff to provide additional assistance and information sharing, particularly related to kinship navigator programs.The Administrator for the Administration for Community Living (ACL) should establish an ongoing process to proactively share information and best practices with states about using National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) funds to serve older relative caregivers of children, especially in states with a relatively large share of grandparent caregivers. This could be achieved, for example, by leveraging regional office staff to share information from states and area agencies on aging that have successfully used this program to serve older relative caregivers.Both recommendations were rejected by the ACL primarily because it felt such actions were not needed given current programming initiatives. Its responses noted the changes made to the NFCSP. It also mentioned that the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act and the Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act also focused on the issues presented. The 2021 RAISE report to Congress included a comprehensive review of the current state of family caregiving and made 26 recommendations for how the federal government, states, tribes, territories, and communitiesin partnership with the private sectorcould take action (ACL, 2022). While the ACL responses indicate attention to the noted concerns, they also signal a lack of attention needed to fully address the opportunity challenge faced by grandparent caregivers with limited financial resources.The ACL (2022) identified hundreds of actions federal agencies will take to prioritize improving access to respite care, including family caregivers as part of a persons care team, strengthening the direct care workforce, and helping to ensure caregivers financial security. However, not once does the strategy mention poverty. This omission is significant because it minimizes or euphemizes poverty and its pernicious effects.There are important questions to raise. Are safety nets adequate? Are too many children still suffering from a lack of resources? Are grandparents relying on minor grandchildren for needed care? Are we doing enough to address ACEs for grandfamilies? Are we addressing the intersections of race and poverty? Are we asking the right people the right questions?My answer to all of these questions is NO.While we have made tremendous strides, we have more work to do. Although this article focuses on grandfamilies, it applies to all families trapped by poverty and failing to experience the opportunities rendered to others. It is not enough to rely upon a bootstrap philosophy. We must think about strategies that simultaneously intervene, heal, and prevent the ACEs that too often penetrate African American lives. Reducing poverty cannot be the goal; ending it is essential. Numbers represent real people. Lets collectively turn the page.Turning the PageIf we know that ACEs predict negative outcomes and block opportunity, we can use this knowledge to focus on policy changes that remove such barriers. While current political debate often highlights the importance of ensuring a thriving middle class, we can advocate for policies that address poverty and its impacts. Individuals experiencing poverty are too often overlooked in our political positions because of the concern that they are unworthy or less important. Some earlier mentioned myths about poverty creep into our thinking and actions. However, as has been said, this is a very important group in our society, and we must address their needs, especially those of grandparents who have stepped in to ensure family members receive the love and care needed to ensure their well-being and access to opportunities.They ask for little, and we deliverwe give them too little. However, we can do more by aggressively supporting their needs. While it is admirable for a minor grandchild to take on caregiving responsibilities, this can impede their opportunities to thrive.We need to move beyond researching the problem to elevating the problem to a national platform with new resources. Grandparents and their grandchildren deserve no less. National advocacy groups such as Save the Children, UNICEF, Child Welfare League of America, Alliance for Children's Rights, National Center for Child Poverty, Children's Bureau, Black Child Welfare Administrators, and Generations United have historically focused on the needs of children. They need our collective support to bring attention to this crisis that seems to be blunted by our indoctrination about poverty being self-imposed and tendency to blame the victim.Just as we have begun to identify opioids as a public health crisis, we should do the same for ACEs and their impact on grandfamilies. Living in poverty is a public health problem. Noting the disproportionality and disparity between Black children and youth of color in the child welfare system (Childrens Bureau, 2024), everything in our power must be done to support African American grandparents who raise their grandchildren. As we celebrate successful interventions, let us carefully consider those attempting to do more with less and replace this reality with doing more with more. Our grandfamilies deserve the maximum versus the minimum standard of care. For African Americans, getting by is not enough.Sandra Edmonds Crewe, MSW, PhD, is dean emerita and professor of Social Work at Howard University, a 40-year member of the Academy of Certified Social Workers, and a long-standing trustee for the Maryland Affordable Housing Trust.

Gonzalez, Star Hagen, Sierra Wollenhall, and Angelique DayFebruary 05, 2025TagsEquity & JusticeInnovation & Social ImpactAbstractThe Port Gamble SKlallam Tribe (PGST) operates as a full-service government, including a child welfare system in the Children and Family Services (CFS) Department and a Kinship Navigator Program, the Kinship Parenting Program. That program works with kinship families living on the reservation and enrolled PGST members living off the reservation but caring for kin. The programs goal is to establish self-sufficiency and long-term stability to keep children out of foster care. It is effective due to its expansive definition of family, integration of community values and customs into services, and close connection to in-house tribal services and supports.Key WordsKinship Navigator, Kinship Care, cultural adaptation, tribal child welfareThe Port Gamble SKlallam Tribe (PGST) Kinship Navigator Program, known as the Kinship Parenting Program, was established in 2016. The Kinship Navigator determines immediate needs and directs families through the often unfamiliar and intimidating public and private resource system that can help stabilize situations faced by kinship caregivers. PGST works with kinship families living on the reservation as well as enrolled PGST members living off the reservation who are caring for kin. The program serves those who are involved with child welfare and those caring for a child outside of the child welfare system to establish self-sufficiency and the long-term stability necessary to keep children out of foster care. The program is uniquely effective because of its expansive definition of family, its integration of community values and customs into its services, and its close connection to a breadth of in-house tribal services and supports for community members.About Port Gamble SKlallam TribePort Gamble SKlallam are known as the Strong People. The PGST is a federally recognized Indian tribe governed by a constitution adopted Aug. 5, 1939. The Tribe operates as a full-service government and oversees all departments, programs, projects, and facilities in accordance with its rights to self-govern. Accordingly, PGST operates its child welfare system within the Children and Family Services (CFS) Department. The Tribes children are our most important resource, and thus the Tribe plays a key role in caring for them. We believe that preserving a childs connections to their family is fundamental to the childs well-being. In SKlallam custom, there are formal and informal ties that bind the community. Extended family ties are based on blood lines, marriage, friendship, and caring, and members of the Port Gamble SKlallam community who are reliable, responsible, loving, and willing to care for a child may be considered family.Eligibility and OutreachThe Kinship Parenting program uses an expansive definition of family and relative, defining family as anyone who lives within the community (Miller et al., 2022). Extended family ties are based on bloodlines, marriage, friendship, and caring. All women in the community become auntie or grandma when they reach a certain age, regardless of blood relationship. This expanded definition of family helps to consider all resources available within a community, which increases the Tribes ability to successfully place children served by the PGST Child Welfare system. This approach also minimizes the experience of trauma when children have to be temporarily placed outside their parental home. Termination of parental rights is not a practice used in the community.Kinship navigator services are offered primarily through an in-home parenting support service structure.PGST staff advertise the program in the tribal memo and newspaper, sharing information about activities, support services, cultural events, and classes. The Kinship Navigator also does personal outreach, working with staff on referrals for any prevention needed to avoid court action and keep the children with family. The Kinship Navigator is closely connected to service providers who work with kinship caregivers and regularly staff meetings with providers located within and outside of the tribe, such as Together for Children (Maternal Home Visiting), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Youth Services, Elders, and Education. The Navigator also meets regularly with PGST Child Welfare staff and the Foster Care Coordinator. Kinship families can access services by calling, emailing, or texting the PGST Kinship Parenting Program. The PGST Kinship Navigator will receive the message and follow up with an intake process, which includes use of the kinship needs assessment to help identify the familys needs and develop a plan to address them.Program DescriptionKinship Navigator services are offered primarily through an in-home parenting support service structure. Until a recent transition, this program was developed and implemented by a trusted tribal elder who is highly regarded in the community. The parenting skills component of the program emphasizes core values and the values of the community, including togetherness and care. The Kinship Navigator helps facilitate the SKlallam Positive Indian Parenting curriculum, along with a mental health counselor and graduates of the program. The parenting curriculum was developed through the tribes IV-E Waiver, incorporating SKlallam values and traditions. The Kinship Parenting program already has been approved in the Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA), one of the few Kinship Navigator programs to earn that approval.The Kinship Navigator provides Kinship Care families with assistance in applying for tribal, state, and federal benefits as well as providing information and referrals for services to address their specific needs. These services promote knowledge and awareness of available resources for health, mental health, financial, legal, and other support services such as local support groups, concrete goods, and cultural and school-related activities.This program has helped me care for my niece and nephews in so many ways. Our family was able to flourish.In addition to providing information and referral services, Kinship Navigators also help to reduce barriers faced by Kinship Care families through problem-solving and collaboration across various sectors of the Tribes social services infrastructure, located in a one-stop-shop community setting. The Kinship Navigators office is in the Children & Family Services building, allowing a wraparound service approach with other service providers, such as PGST Child Welfare, TANF, Child Support, Together for Children (Maternal Home Visiting), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and other support services.PGST offers numerous cultural activities, during which PGST staff organize a speaker to talk with kinship caregivers and their children about challenges they face and help them find solutions. Speakers in the past have included a mental health counselor, a speaker who explained child development, someone who addressed working with children who have behavioral challenges, or other topics caregivers would like to learn about. This creates a support system between service providers and kinship families and addresses the needs of the families to promote stability and success. Past cultural activities include cedar weaving, wool weaving, and drum and rattle making.The program includes an evidence-based case management component that was adapted to align with PGSTs cultural values. PGST worked closely with Washington State to redesign a non-tribal version of a kinship needs assessment to align with PGST values and practices. Part of this adaptation included omitting questions from the assessment tool which were deemed not necessary to assess a familys need for support. The adapted needs assessment asks about income assistance the household receives, information about the PGST children in their care, and the caregivers rating of their own health and their childrens health. The assessment also asks caregivers about the services they use and the services they need to support themselves and the children in their care. After completing the assessment, the caregiver works with the Kinship Navigator to set goals that align with the service needs of the caregiver and the PGST children in their care.Impact & SustainabilityThe Kinship Parenting Program helps families who otherwise may not have been able to receive assistance, such as families who are caring for children outside of the child welfare system. For example, the Kinship Navigator Program helped a grandmother raising her grandson, who is wheelchair bound, to modify their bathroom to allow him access, making it handicap accessible. Another caregiver shared, This program has helped me care for my niece and nephews in so many ways. Through guidance, encouragement, goods and services. Our family was able to flourish. I feel incredibly blessed to have an amazing support system.The program, along with other prevention efforts, also has reduced the number of children in the child welfare system. The number of open child welfare cases has dropped dramatically since implementing the Kinship Navigator Program: In 2016, PGST had 48 open child welfare cases, and by 2024, that number has reduced to just 6 open child welfare cases. We believe this is because the program offers supports to families to help them sustain their placement and prevent court or child welfare involvement. By working with the community and establishing a trusting relationship with caregivers, caregivers reach out for help before their situation reaches crisis levels. Everyone in the tribe benefits from this.Cheryl A. Miller, MLS, is director, Children & Family Services, for the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe in Kingston, WA Joylina J.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202425I Wanna Put That Education in ThemBy LaShawnDa PittmanFebruary 05, 2025TagsHealth & Well-beingEconomic SecurityEquity & JusticeAbstractThis article examines how grandmothers raising their grandchildren in skipped-generation households support their grandchildrens cognitive development across the life course, predominantly by prioritizing their education in daily routines and by communicating with, learning from, and advocating on behalf of their grandchildren with teachers, healthcare providers, caseworkers, and social service agency staff. When children exhibited cognitive delays and disabilities, grandmothers sought institutional support, even as they faced additional barriers not experienced by parents, including not being legal guardians, not having all the necessary information to assist healthcare providers with diagnoses, and fear of losing their grandchildren should they seek assistance.Key Wordscognitive development, cognitive delays and disabilities, parenting, grandparent caregiving, skipped-generation households, grandfamily, kinship careWhen I asked 45-year-old Angela what she wanted for her grandchildrens future she said, I really just want to put God in em and education and they can take it from there. Like other grandmothers I interviewed, Angela demonstrated her prioritization of her 9- and 5-year-old grandchildrens education in her daily childrearing practices.Like they come home from school, go right in the kitchen, sit at that table. They be like, Hey grandma, it seem like Im still at school. I say, Well maybe you is, so get them books out. Come home from school they have to do their homework, then they can like play games or whatever. Lets get that studying while its still fresh in the mind when you get outta school ... I wanna put that education in them. Education is important. Itll get you somewhere in life. Itll get you a good job and everything. Thats number one. I want them to get their education.Angela put that education in her grandchildren by also reading to them nightly and volunteering in their classrooms. She was not alone. In this article, Ill show that grandmothers routinely supported their grandchildrens cognitive development by 1) observing their learning abilities; 2) building cognitive, language, and communication skill-building tasks and activities into their daily routines; and 3) communicating with teachers and healthcare providers about learning problems. Grandmothers understood that investing in education was the best way to prepare their grandchildren for success. So, they 4) devoted time, energy, and resources to teaching their grandchildren and to facilitating their education (e.g., transporting them to and from school/childcare, enrolling them in and participating in supplemental educational programs). They also 5) advocated on their behalf with teachers, school administrators, caseworkers, and social service agency staff to ensure that they received the resources, services, and support they needed to learn.Cognitive development refers to thinking across the lifespan (e.g., learning, problem-solving, creating, reasoning, conceptualizing, categorizing, remembering, planning, etc.) and is measured according to age-appropriate milestones. A cognitive delay is related to a childs inability to process information intellectually, based upon what is appropriate for their age. In addition to impacting a childs ability to think, learn, and problem solve, a cognitive delay may also impact their communication, behavior, and social skills. Approximately 12 in 1,000 children have a cognitive delay; these delays range from mild to severe and include, but are not limited to, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism (The Warren Center, n.d.).Supporting the developmental needs of children with cognitive delays was more challenging for the grandmothers in my study. Grandmothers limited experience with cognitive delays and disabilities, combined with their lack of legal authority, impeded their ability to get the resources and services their grandchildren needed. Yet, grandmothers raising grandchildren with cognitive and developmental delays also prioritized their grandchildrens education, and they sought and fought to ensure that their grandchildren got an appropriate and adequate education.Supporting Childrens Cognitive Development Across the Life CourseGenerally, until a child was enrolled in pre-K (ages 4 to 5), grandmothers were primarily responsible for teaching their grandchildren and, along with the childs doctor, were responsible for noting whether or not their grandchild was reaching appropriate developmental milestones. Once children became preschoolers, early childhood educators also taught them and assessed their development. Along with healthcare professionals and caseworkers, early childhood educators communicated with grandmothers about developmental expectations and concerns and directed grandmothers to early intervention programs.Grandmothers supported childrens (ages 5 to 12) and adolescents (ages 12 to 18) educational needs by ensuring that they attended school, behaved while there, and did their schoolwork. Their hands-on involvement, which included tutoring them and volunteering at school, was meant to keep grandchildren on track and demonstrate that someone cared about them and their education. This involvement was contingent upon the childs age and educational needs; the grandmothers relationship with the school, teachers, and biological parents; and her time, energy, motivation, and capacity. Additionally, healthcare professionals, caseworkers, and teachers monitored child development among school-age children and adolescents and helped grandmothers get the appropriate evaluation services when they were concerned about any developmental issues.Supporting the developmental needs of children with cognitive delays was more challenging for the grandmothers.Sixty-nine-year-old Ida typified how grandmothers taught age-appropriate cognitive skills to their toddler grandchildren. Ida and her husband UZ became their newborn great-granddaughters licensed foster parents when she was born with neonatal drug exposure and taken into state custody. Ida described teaching 1-year-old Sugar colors, letter recognition, and hand/eye coordination: Shes learnin how to talk. She watch you, whatever youre doin, she gonna try to do. And you try to hide somethin she goes right to it because she look. She learn so fast what color you had. And, she go right to it and find it.Ida planned to add ABC blocks to Sugars play-and-learn sessions. She was also teaching Sugar to use crayons to scribblethe precursor to teaching her how to write.Forty-one-year-old Shalonda demonstrated how grandmothers supported their grandchildrens education when early childhood educators or teachers expressed concern about cognitive delays. When Shalondas granddaughter Dana was in kindergarten, her teacher expressed that there was a gap between her ability and age expectations. Initially, Shalonda didnt want to believe the assessment but after Danas teacher explained it, she accepted it.She said, I bought phonics games. Cards, flash cards. I pin words up around the house, the letters on the refrigerator. On her door, all kinds of stuff. Ill be riding in my car and say, What color is that? What does that say? I will do that all the way to work, all the way home, to kinda keep her up on stuff.Over time, Danas grandmother, childcare provider, and preschool teacher improved her learning ability and outcomes. Although Dana was now spelling words, shes reading well. Shes not very good at homework though, not doing it, but turning it in, Shalonda divulged Danas first-grade teachers verdict: Her attention span is not where it should be.Fifty-year-old Dorothy showed how grandmothers not only devoted time to teaching their grandchildren, but also acted in their best interest by challenging institutional protocols and missteps. Dorothy had cared for her 7-year-old grandson Vashon for 4 years because of his mothers housing instability and struggle with drug addiction. She described:For two years I was off work. I would teach him math and we developed a really good close relationship then. I taught him to write. He could write whatever I put on the paper could copy it back to me. And I was teaching him the first-case addition. One plus one, two plus two, one plus two, and one plus three. The ones and the twos. And he was doing that when he got into preschool.In the predominately white school Vashon attended, he did homework and was excelling. But once Dorothy started working, she had to change his school to accommodate her schedule.Homework at the new school, would be tracing letters or coloring, just doing whatever. Dorothy met with the principal and had Vashon replicate the work she had taught him in their kitchen-turned-makeshift Romper Room, then asked, Does this look like a boy that needs to trace Ks all day? This school is holding him back. Im displeased, Dorothy said.She continued, I found another school for my grandson and hell be leaving here. I worked with school reform, I know what the curriculum should be like for a preschooler and just tracing the letter K is just not it. She expressed concern for the other neighborhood kids who would receive an inferior education.I found another school for my grandson and hell be leaving here. I worked with school reform, I know what the curriculum should be like for a preschooler.Cora was one of many grandmothers who attended school events and teachers conferences and volunteered at their grandchildrens school. Cora had raised six of her eight grandchildren (four as a licensed foster and adoptive parent and two in a private kinship arrangement) because of their mothers drug addiction and distressed romantic relationships. At the time of the interview, she was still raising two of them, an 18- and a 15-year-old. Cora kept track of and called the homes of children who missed school: And that would help my grandchildren. Id see them every day they go to school, Id be right behind them. In addition to showing them she cared, Coras presence kept her grandchildren in line, meaning well-behaved.Grandmothers acted as tutors by first learning and then teaching their grandchildren various subjects. When I arrived at the home of 81-year-old Virginia and her husband Norman to conduct our interview, her kitchen table was piled with large stacks of index cards that she had made for her 11-year-old grandson Omar. He had been distracted in school because he had been visiting with his father, whod recently been released from prison.She described, I sit up here sometimes, like the other night he went with his dad and he lied about his homework. So, he got home late and he was tired and he went to bed I stayed up and it was some kind of math and Im not the best in math; some of this new stuff that they have with the graphing and stuff. Anyway, I stayed up until almost 4:00 a.m. trying to get this stuff together and then I got him up and tried to explain it to him so he wouldnt get a F.Grandmothers supported their grandchildrens cognitive development by investing in their learning experiences in age-appropriate ways. They relied upon their experience raising their own children and on educators, healthcare professionals, and caseworkers to determine what was developmentally appropriate and to improve their strategies.Supporting Children with Cognitive Delays and DisabilitiesGrandmothers often were the first to detect cognitive delays in their grandchildren because they spent the most time with them. Children in this study exhibited cognitive delays and disabilities due to neonatal drug exposure, biological or birth-related issues (e.g., being born prematurely, genetic conditions, poor eyesight or hearing), and for unknown reasons. These grandmothers found themselves in one of two positions in these cases. In the first group were grandmothers who were aware of the source of childrens symptoms because it was the reason for their assuming caregiving responsibilities. The second group comprised those who were forced to try to uncover the cause of their grandchilds issues. Grandmothers in both groups supported their grandchildrens cognitive development by intensifying their institutional embeddedness.Responding to children who exhibited cognitive delays was complicated. Unlike parents in similar situations, grandmothers faced additional barriers, including not being legal guardians, not having all the necessary information to assist healthcare providers with diagnoses, and fear of losing their grandchildren should they seek assistance. It was especially challenging for grandmothers who had to search for a diagnosis, which involved piecing together information from the childs symptoms, doctors assessments, and recalling parental risk behaviors.Additionally, grandmothers had to consider how easily they could navigate specific institutions, based upon their familiarity with the institutions operations, their legal status, and possession (if needed) of the childs medical card. As a result, there was sometimes a mismatch between childrens needs and the care they received.Fifty-two-year-old Cheryl showed how grandmothers noticed and responded to childrens cognitive delays when they had information about the possible causes:When Tevin was born, he used to cry all the time. I mean all the time. Just cry. Id say, Why you cry so much? Come to find out he was having withdrawals from that reefer or drug or whatever she was on [Tevins mothers crack cocaine addiction had contributed to his developmental disabilities]. She wasnt staying with me so I didnt know what she was on. He used to jump around all the time. When he was first born, he used to do everything strange.Cheryl took Tevin to Chicago Memorial Hospital to get him tested: When they got through with him, he had everything wrong with him. Glasses that thick. Everything. Attention deficit disorder. Learning disability, everything. Tevin attended special education classes through the 11th grade and shifted to general education classes in the 12th grade. He was attending college when the interview was conducted, but Cheryl repeated this process with another grandchild who was diagnosed with ADD.Forty-eight-year-old Natalie and her husband Rod also knew the source of their grandsons cognitive delay. She described the impact of him being born a preemie at 15 weeks weighing 1 pound, 11 ounces.So, he spent the first 9 months of his life in the hospital. [Laughter] So, he was like developmentally delayed. They tried to put a lot of labels on him and Im like its not gonna happen. This boys gonna be okay. Hes graduating and goin to first grade this year.Interviewer: And they tried to say he was developmentally delayed?They tried to put a lot of labels on him. He is a little bit delayed. I mean, I was in denial. Theres nothin wrong with him. Hes gonna be fine. But he is a little delayed. There are a lot of things his brother can do that he cant.Natalie pushed back against the school placing her grandson in special education.Natalie pushed back against the school placing her grandson in special education. Instead, they agreed to do an Individualized Education Program and watch him. Natalie illustrated the hesitancy, and in some cases resistance, that some grandmothers shared about getting their grandchildren diagnosed with a cognitive delay, which would involve labeling them with that delay: I said I didnt want it (special education), so with the evaluation, they said, He really dont need to be in there because he is keepin up. I didnt, I dont want labels on him.Sixty-three-year-old Eliza and her husband, Tony, had cared for six of their grandchildren (ages 16, 12, 9, 7, 4, and 3 years old) for a total of 7 years as the childrens mother struggled with substance addiction. All of the children except one were considered special needs and were in special education. Eliza learned about the early learning home visiting program through Metropolitan Family Services.She explained, The Easter Seal people would come in like three days a week. Elijah, the 4-year-old, he was in the program first so Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday were his days. After he aged out then Gavin got in, so he was having three days of speech therapy. They come to the house and work with them. the younger one [Gavin] had physical therapy at one time there were four different therapies going.For Eliza, the programs were incredibly helpful: When she first got her now 3- and 4-year-old grandchildren, they couldnt eat on their own they werent talking, so the speech therapy helped. The younger one wasnt walking, so the physical therapy helped him. The older children participated in the child and adolescent mental health support program and tutoring programs. Although her schedule had eased up some as her six grandchildren had gotten older, Eliza was still extremely busy. Her complicated schedule involved making sure that she and her grandchildren were available, dressing presentably every day, and ensuring that the house was clean so that the various specialists and social workers could use the same bathroom as her six grandchildren. As a testament to how beneficial her very strenuous schedule was to her grandchildren, Gavin was, out of the early intervention program and hell be going to school.Typifying what it was like for grandmothers who sought medical assistance to pinpoint why their grandchildren were experiencing cognitive delays with unknown causes, 48-year-old Kathleen described how her 15-year-old granddaughter Tayaunas cognitive delays and disabilities manifested:Because she stayed in Pampers until she was about 2 and 6 months. She couldnt talk. It took her lets see, how old was she when she really actually started speaking words? Probably about 10. And, okay, about 12 she started to speak sentences but not a complete sentence. Til this day she cant speak a complete sentence, not really, not like we could; not like a normal child.It took Kathleen 4 years to get Tayauna properly diagnosed.So, I stayed at every hospital cuz it took me years to try to determine what was her diagnosis. Because no doctor could find a diagnosis to determine what was wrong with her. Because my daughter had a normal birth, full-term, but they couldnt understand why she was like she is So, I took her to just about every hospital in Chicago. And then when I took her to osteopathic thats when they just came up with developmental delay.Grandmothers based their strategies to support grandchildren not just on educational needs but on what they could actually provide. It was more difficult for grandmothers caring for children with cognitive delays and disabilities to sync up their schedules and skill sets. I define syncing up as aligning schedules and skill sets with grandchildrens needs, common among grandmothers seeking to save and maximize time, balance paid work and care work, and respond appropriately to childrens developmental needs.Some grandmothers struggled to fully embrace the physical, mental, and emotional labor of caregiving and postponed responding to caregiving demands, a strategy I refer to as stalling. While most grandmothers devoted time to teaching and facilitating the education of their grandchildren, especially non-school-age children and those with cognitive delays, some practiced stalling to privilege their own mental and physical health challenges, and difficulty fulfilling their responsibilities. This was particularly true for children who required more institutional support, forcing grandmothers to engage with healthcare providers, teachers, caseworkers, and social service agencies.ConclusionRaising their own children and relying on feedback they received from educators, healthcare providers, and caseworkers armed grandmothers with an understanding of the broad timeframes by which children should engage in age-specific tasks and helped them to catch childrens developmental delays early. Grandmothers invested in their grandchildrens learning experiences, even when it meant eliminating other activities and struggling to sync up their schedules and skills to meet their new responsibilities. But they didnt do so alone. As with fulfilling childrens social, emotional, and physical developmental needs, grandmothers relied on support from parents, partners, and extended kinship networks to meet their grandchildrens cognitive developmental needs.When caring for children with cognitive delays and disabilities, obtaining a proper diagnosis was not only paramount to adequately attending to childrens needs but also was imperative when seeking additional resources and services, such as Supplemental Security Income, early intervention and supplemental learning programs, and mental health support. The efforts of these grandmothers to search for a diagnosis and get their grandchildren medical treatment were complicated by their legal and socioeconomic status, and by their lack of information about their grandchildrens afflictions.LaShawnDa Pittman, PhD, is an associate professor of American Ethnic Studies and the Joff Hanauer Honors Professor of Western Civilization at the University of Washington in Seattle.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Monkey Business ImagesReferencesThe Warren Center.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202425Family Dynamics When Grandchildren Are Not Siblings: An Opening DiscussionBy Deborah Marie WhitleyFebruary 05, 2025TagsHealth & Well-beingEconomic SecurityAgeism & CultureAbstractThis article draws attention to the influence of family composition among grandparent-headed families, and its likely impact on family functioning. In this instance, family composition refers to the number of members in a family unit and whether the grandchildren are siblings, cousins, or fictive kin relations. Researchers and practitioners can employ an alternative lens through which to view grandparent-headed families and assess their influence on family dynamics by raising questions and awareness about family composition.Key Wordsfamily composition, custodial grandparents, family dynamicsThe study of grandparents raising grandchildren has a dynamic history covering various facets of family functioning, grandparent well-being, and grandchild outcomes. Research findings suggest grandparents are challenged by intense emotional and physical stress and strains while raising their grandchildren. In addition, we know concepts such as resiliency, empowerment, and resourcefulness have positively influenced grandparents overall well-being (Hayslip et al., 2012; Musil et al., 2019; Whitley et al., 2012).However, one characteristic of grandparent-headed families that has yet to receive much attention in the grandparent literature is family composition, which refers to the number of members in a family unit and whether the grandchildren are siblings, cousins, or fictive kin relations. This article discusses how family composition might influence family functioning and dynamics in households where grandparents are raising grandchildren.What About Family Composition?Studies about custodial grandparents usually present standard descriptors of the grandparent that include age, gender, and caregiving duration, along with the number, ages, and genders of their biological grandchildren. Grandparents education and income may also be included. However, usually there are no questions about the parentage of the grandchildren. Even though most grandchildren in the family are biologically related to the grandparent, there seems to be an unspoken assumption that the grandchildren are from the same birth parents. Therefore, they comprise a single-sibling group. Using this perspective is not necessarily incorrect, but it may not accurately represent the family and its particular needs. Might other features of grandparent-headed families need consideration to better understand this family group?Previous studies on grandparent-headed households rarely give any indication of whether the custodial grandchildren are from a single birth parent or different birth parents within the family system. Perhaps grandparents raising their grandchildren from one birth parent is a common structure for most intergenerational families. But it is unclear why one would assume so, especially because extended families are so prevalent in many cultural groups, such as in African American and Latino families.When sibling groups experience different types of negative parenting, grandparents may have to navigate their grandchildrens physical, mental, developmental, and social adverse effects.In such families, it is not uncommon for a cousin to come to live with a family, and for the siblings to openly identify that cousin as their brother or sister. Such reclassification of family members is a way to give the cousin a sense of being fully and intimately connected with the immediate family unit, especially following a crisis involving the birth parents (Allen et al., 2011). It is a way for the family to tell the cousin, You may not belong with your mom right now, but you do belong to us.Failing to explore such cultural nuances when defining family composition might lead to misinterpretations about the sources of grandchildrens emotional and physical stress or the levels of trauma as perpetrated by different birth parents within a family unit. The custodial grandparent needs to establish a family structure that promotes positive functioning and includes all grandchildren, who may have different parenting experiences. When separate sibling groups experience different types of negative parenting, grandparents may be required to navigate their grandchildrens varied physical, mental, developmental, and social adverse effects.To gain more insight into this idea, the Figure below illustrates a grandparent-headed family that includes blood-related grandchildren with fictive kin relations, all under the care of a single grandparent.Family Diagram ExampleIn the Figure, the grandmother (GM), who is widowed and has three children, is her grandchildrens primary or secondary caregiver. Her first daughter (D1) is married and has two young children (GC1 and GC2); the grandmother provides childcare for these grandchildren while their parents work.The second daughter (D2) is in the military and has two school-age children (GC3 and GC4); the grandmother has temporary guardianship of these grandchildren while her daughter is deployed overseas.The grandmothers third child, a son, had two children, but is recently deceased. Before her sons death, his children had spent extended periods with their grandmother. Their birth mother was not married to the childrens father and her whereabouts are unknown.Lastly, the grandmother has a goddaughter for whom she has provided frequent care due to substance misuse by the goddaughters parent. On a recent visit, the mother failed to return after leaving her daughter in the care of GM. The grandmother is seeking to become her foster parent.While this family structure seems complex and overwhelming, it reflects a reality faced by a segment of grandparent-headed families. For example, extended family structures are often formed based on tradition, culture, and necessity. Many caregivers cannot afford formal daycare services and depend upon family members to assist with childcare support. When parents have job opportunities or military duty, their children often live with grandparents until the parents return. It is often common for non-related families to form bonds connecting their children in fictive kin relationships that are just as strong and enduring as relationships by blood.Family ExperiencesFive of the seven children in the figure above have experienced crises involving their birth parents, likely leading to intense emotional strain or trauma. Parental death, abandonment, separation, and possible abuse/neglect are the leading adversities experienced by the children in the example. Emotional reactions can include stress, anxiety, and depression, possibly resulting in externalizing behavioral challenges at home and school.For example, the grandchildren whose mother is on military duty (GC3 and GC4) could experience anxiety and stress depending on her location, length of deployment, and type of military duty. Previous studies have suggested that children as young as 3 whose parents are deployed can exhibit increased externalizing behavioral symptoms, such as tearfulness and disciplinary problems; in older children, signs of aggressive behavior or impulsivity may be apparent (Chartrand et al., 2008). One might consider how this context influences the familys overall functioning based on the grandmothers parenting style, established family norms, and defined roles and responsibilities within the family unit.Two other grandchildren (GC5 and GC6) are likely to experience emotional effects stemming from their experience of maternal abandonment and the fathers recent death. In response to parental abandonment, it is not uncommon for children to have feelings of guilt, shame, and an intense sense of loss (Marici et al., 2023). These emotions could also characterize the goddaughter, who was abandoned by her mother. Following the death of a parent, children can potentially experience prolonged grief and depression with psychological and social functioning impairment, making it difficult for them to focus on school and complete tasks, and they may become socially isolated (Melhem et al., 2011). Because GC5 and GC6 and the goddaughter had similar experiences, one may wonder how they interact and relate. How do their interactions influence the relationship between them and their grandmother or other members of the family?One also may wonder what influence the older childrens behaviors have on the youngest grandchildren (GC1 and GC2), even though they are with the grandmother for limited hours per day. A further question to consider centers on D2s eventual return from military service: Could there be emotional repercussions or a level of secondary trauma felt by the remaining children who may experience a deep sense of loss when D2s children leave the home to live with their mother?Further, as is always the possibility with birth parents who have abandoned their children, there is the risk that those parents may unexpectedly return, which can create tension, stress, and even chaos between the grandparent, birth parent, and grandchildren. Experiencing this form of family stress can impact all the children in the home. Again, these points highlight the complexities intergenerational families can experience and the unexpected emotional upheavals that can occur and re-occur.Family SupportsBecause family composition can be complex, it may be challenging to discern which service supports and resources families require. In some cases, a grandchild needs mental health support for a longer duration than medical insurance programs will approve. In other cases, grandparents are hard-pressed to find a mental health or behavioral health specialist for children that is accessible in their locality, such as in rural communities.More service options are needed to help these families, but until then, the grandparents and the grandchildren are disadvantaged. These challenges are not specific just to families with complex compositions; they reflect the needs of many relative caregivers of children. Although, the more complicated the family composition (as depicted in the Figure), the more amplified such common issues become.More service options are needed to assist these families, but until then, the grandparents and the grandchildren are disadvantaged.Understanding the impact of family composition on functioning becomes apparent only when supported by compelling evidence, which will guide the development of relevant family support programs. There exists a variety of family services directed toward grandparents and other family relatives and kin who have taken on the parenting role of children. (For more information, see Generations United, 2023).These programs have provided a lifeline to grandparent-headed families. With the support of public and/or private funding, many grandparents have access to therapeutic mental health support services through community health centers, as well as access to local support groups and respite care services to help counter some of the chronic stress that comes with parenting children with unique mental health and behavioral health needs. Legal support is not always widely available to address complex legal issues involving such exceptional circumstances. It is likely that more communities need family support services. The intensity and diversity of grandparent and grandchild needs, as illustrated by the examples above, suggests family composition could be a factor that intensifies families vulnerability for adverse outcomes without appropriate and accessible direct support services.Conclusion and Next StepsThis article intends to broaden perspectives about grandparent-headed families and consider the influence of family composition on family functioning. When grandparents assume full-time parenting responsibilities for their grandchildren, many do so because they are adamant about having the children remain connected to their family group. Family connection preserves family ties, values, and traditions, all of which are potentially lost or suspended if children are placed in non-relative care. But in keeping family members connected, the chances of having families with an expanded composition may occur.Past studies also have shown grandchildren raised by grandparents have a propensity for mental and behavioral health problems, which can negatively impact their academic progress, cognitive development, and social/emotional well-being (see Xu & Harrison, 2023; Xu et al., 2022).Short of accessing mental health and educational intervention services, the risk of school failure and dropout is high for many of these young people. The long-term impact of such outcomes is worrisome for families. Perhaps exploring the influence of family composition may not only guide our understanding of the vulnerabilities or risks of this family group, but also help us to discover its strengths.At present, it is essential to recognize that there are families, as depicted in the Figure, that reflect the given family structure with all its potential risks for adverse consequences experienced by various family members. Hopefully, one can also appreciate how the familys composition might influence family dynamics (e.g., behavior patterns, communication styles, adherence to established family norms) that might create instability within the family unit for a time, but also potentially promote family stability. The following thoughts use family composition within grandparent-headed families as a lens through which to frame exploratory research ideas.Does family composition influence custodial grandparents parenting styles and grandchildrens outcomes?To what extent do the grandchildrens varied biological relationships and accompanying trauma-based experiences influence their emotional well-being?Is it possible that the dynamics in an extended family group differ based upon how grandparents relate to grandchildren of a single sibling group with relatively similar trauma exposures vs. different sibling groups with diverse trauma exposures?Are there differences in how grandparents relate to non-blood-related family members, such as godchildren, compared with their biologically related grandchildren?In essence, does it make any difference in grandparent or grandchild outcomes when the family composition includes variations of blood/non-blood relationships?Does family composition influence the balance of power in the family group?How do grandchildren from different sibling groups, including fictive kin, positively/negatively influence the behaviors of other sibling sets in the family?There is very little information on the impact of family composition on family or child outcomes, particularly in grandparent-headed families; defining which support services and resources might best help these families remains difficult. Existing services and programs may be a start, but more study is required to determine the merits of the posed questions, along with any specific practice strategies.Deborah Marie Whitley, PhD, is a professor and director of online programming at the School of Social Work, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, at Georgia State University in Atlanta.Photo credit: Shutterstock/fizkesReferencesAllen, K.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202425Diversity Among Grandparent Caregivers: What We Need to LearnBy Bert Hayslip, Jr.February 05, 2025TagsEquity & JusticeInnovation & Social ImpactAbstract:This article examines the implications of prioritizing diversity among grandparent caregivers as a lens through which they can be better understood, with special attention to Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color (BIPOC). Over the past few decades, the focus has been on Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos, with some work on Indigenous grandparent caregivers (Native American, Hawaiian), and Asian Americans, and much of this effort reflects between-group comparisons from secondary datasets that precluded an emphasis on BIPOC grandparents raising grandchildren. We need qualitative, small sampleoriented work, based on one-on-one interviews and focus groups to understand the daily lived experiences of BIPOC grandparents raising grandchildren. Importantly, this will contribute to a greater depth of understanding of such persons, focusing on individuals needs, feelings, behaviors, and values regarding raising a grandchild.Key Words:BIPOC grandparents, grandparent caregivers, BIPOC grandparents, grandchildrenOver the past decade, interest in the lives of grandparents raising grandchildren has increased dramatically among practitioners and researchers. It has been nearly 50 years since the appearance of Meredith Minkler and her colleagues classic work on African American grandparent caregivers raising their grandchildren amid the crack cocaine epidemic, as well as their descriptive documentation of diversity among grandparent caregivers, i.e., grandparents who are American Indian, Alaska Native, Mexican American, Central American, and African American.Building upon Minklers work, the literature from past decades has provided us with vast insight into topics including the health consequences and emotional impact of raising a grandchild, the efficacy of interventions with grandparent caregivers, access and barriers to needed services, and the presence and use of personal and interpersonal resources. That race/ethnicity, in concert with other parametersage, gender, geographic location (rural versus urban residence)collectively differentiate grandparent caregivers has been recognized for several decades (see, e.g., Kropf & Kolomer, 2004).Moreover, it is well-recognized that grandparents who are Black, Indigenous, or Hispanic/Latino are disadvantaged in many respects. These grandparents tend to have lower incomes, be in poorer relative health, and be less educated (see Montoro-Rodriguez & Ramsey, 2019). This differential vulnerability underscores the importance of access to health, economic, and medical service supports for BIPOC grandparents and/or their grandchildren; affordable healthcare (Medicaid, CHIP), economic supports and resources (public assistance programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [TANF]); affordable housing (Section 8 Family Unification Program, Fair Housing Act); mental healthrelated services (Hayslip & Maiden, 2023); and legal assistance (see Cox, 2019).Such support may be especially difficult to access for informal grandparent caregiversthose who have not legally adopted the child. (Adoption may be viewed negatively by Black grandparents; see Kropf & Kolomer, 2004.) Informal grandparent caregivers lack legal custody or guardianship and face difficulty in making legal or medical decisions for the child and in enrolling the child in school. These grandparents could especially benefit from culturally competent Kinship Navigators to assist them in accessing needed services and supports (Cox, 2019). This vulnerability of BIPOC grandparents underscores the importance of understanding such persons in light of the unique challenges they face in raising a grandchild, as well as in terms of their unique needs, feelings, attitudes, and strengths.Future research on BIPOC grandfamilies should encompass a continuum of breadth and depth in scope.Despite this awareness, work on diversity among grandparents raising their grandchildren has lagged behind that on grandparent caregiving more generally, especially as it relates to theinteractionof race/ethnicity and caregiving as well as variability between and within groups of grandparents of color, Indigenous grandparents, and grandparents who are of African or Caribbean descent.This relative inattention to BIPOC grandparent caregivers is evidenced by the comparatively limited number of published studies focusing on non-Hispanic Black grandparent caregivers, wherein most of such work has been conducted by Deborah Whitley and her colleagues at Georgia State University (Whitley et al., 2016).While still relatively rare, sporadic work, much of which is qualitative, focusing on BIPOC grandparents has appeared recently, including work on grandparent caregivers who are Hispanic/Latino (Burnette, 2009; Mendoza et al., 2018; Whitley & Fuller-Thomson, 2018), Hawaiian (Yancura, 2010, 2013), Asian American (Ihara et al., 2012; Phua & Kaufman, 2008; Yancura, 2013), Alaska Native (Lewis et al., 2018), Pacific Islander (Yancura, 2010), and Native American/First Nations Canadian (Byers et al., 2017; Dennis & Brewer, 2017; Fuller-Thomson, 2005; Mignon & Holmes, 2013).Thus, while interest in BIPOC grandparent caregivers has begun to grow, important work that has implications for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers has yet to be done. While comparisons across subgroups of grandparents have been made, more often than not they are drawn from pre-established secondary datasets whose primary purpose was not to study BIPOC grandparents, and often reflect only Black, non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic/Latino persons raising their grandchildren. Even at that, in most comparative studies, BIPOC grandparents are underrepresented.I feel this severely restricts the quality of our knowledge about such caregivers. Clearly, more work is necessary to paint a comprehensive picture of whether and how BIPOC grandparents differ with respect to one another (and from non-BIPOC grandparents) as well as how and why such persons vary from one another within groups. What do BIPOC grandparents share in common with other grandparent caregivers? What differentiates them and other such persons? To what extent do BIPOC grandparents differ among themselves? Are they homogeneous? What factors explain such variability?I would suggest that future research on BIPOC grandfamilies should encompass a continuum of breadth and depth in scope. We know relatively little about the day-to-day interactions between such grandparents and their grandchildren and how such interactions are shaped by each dyads relationships with, for example, non-caregiving grandparent peers, other family members, friends, neighbors, co-workers, or healthcare professionals. What is the unique influence that being a BIPOC grandparent plays in shaping such interactions?Thus, while between-group comparisons can provide needed breadth, I argue that our BIPOC knowledge base needs greater depth, which can be achieved via focus groupbased work, which could illuminate individuals needs, concerns, and feelings. Emphasizing such depth thus enables us to understand diversity from the inside out, in contrast to acquiring such knowledge solely from the outside in, where inferences about depth cannot be made based upon survey/questionnaire data, especially if such data are secondary in nature.This issue ofGenerationshelps mitigate this lack of attention to the lives of BIPOC grandparent caregivers, as well as addressing the need for greater depth in the study of the daily lives of such persons.For example, while comparative survey data might indicate that Black grandmothers are more resilient than are White grandmothers, it remains to be understood what life course/experiential factors are important in understanding the origins of such resilience, how those factors impact everyday life, how such resilience is manifested in the decisions Black grandmothers make about raising a grandchild, as well as how Black grandparent caregivers resilience impacts their efforts at overcoming barriers to getting services and help from others.Likewise, we need more work reflecting the lived experiences of such persons that emphasizes the rewards, strengths, and challenges of raising a grandchild from within each persons cultural experiential perspective. What everyday challenges do BIPOC grandparents face? What strengths and resources do they bring when coping with such challenges? What barriers have they encountered to help and support from those who provide services? How have they overcome these barriers (e.g., microaggressive interactions with others, age and/or racial discrimination)? How much social support from others do they receive? How do they cope with stigma and isolation from others? To what extent are constructs relevant to how BIPOC grandfamilies cope uniquely reflected in the everyday experiences of BIPOC grandparents familism, reciprocity, acculturation, intergenerational solidarity/transmission of culturally based values, mutuality, spiritualityversus other grandparent caregivers?Fortunately, this issue ofGenerationshelps mitigate this lack of attention to the lives of BIPOC grandparent caregivers, as well as addressing the need for greater depth in the study of the daily lives of such persons. Articles by Pittman (Black grandmothers supporting their grandchildrens cognitive and social-emotional development), Accius (autobiographical account of the strengths of his Black grandmother), Simpson (African American grandmother caregivers coping in the face of adversity), Mendoza (Latino grandmothers as caregivers), and Peterson (case study of an African-American grandmothers experience as a compound caregiver) all do an excellent job in speaking to the worth of providing in-depth qualitative portrayals of the culturally bound lived experience of raising a grandchild.Additionally, articles by Cox (empowerment training), Crewe (poverty and grandparent caregiving), Whitley (family dynamics among grandfamilies), Smith (policy and grandparent caregiving), and Miller and colleagues (culturally sensitive kinship navigator programs) provide rich and sensitively presented insights into a variety of heretofore underappreciated and understudied contextual aspects of BIPOC grandparent caregiving. Collectively, these articles clearly enrich our understanding of and insight into the experience of raising a grandchild for BIPOC grandparents.This emphasis on the call for greater depth in the study of BIPOC grandfamilies parallels that of Rachel Dunifon, who several years ago argued for the need to better understand grandfamilies everyday lives. Likewise, the frustrations and successes in getting adequate housing, medical, social, or legal service are likely to impact BIPOC grandparent self-efficacy, grandparentgrandchild relationships, and interactions with others. Understanding such issues has important implications for policy, especially as it relates to issues of equal access and discrimination.Reflecting this microsystemic perspective on the dynamics of BIPOC grandfamilies, I advocate taking a family systems approach that also embraces the family lifecycle as well as diversity across multiple parameters (e.g., age, gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, rural-urban residence) in the context of the ecology of Uri Bronfenbrenners microsystem. This focus is consistent with an emphasis on the lived experiences of BIPOC grandparent caregivers and would have important implications for the treatment of dysfunctional systemic dynamics in such grandfamilies, to the extent that they are sometimes driven by trauma, i.e., drug use and abuse or family violence (see Byers et al., 2017; Mignon & Holmes, 2013), about which we know very little.Reflecting on the least microsystemic perspective, I note that despite recent interest in grandparent caregivers parenting and challenges encountered while parenting (see Brunissen et al., 2020) this is another underappreciated dimension of BIPOC grandparents lives. Research would be beneficial that targets how such parentchild interactions shape and are shaped by the efficacy of the grandparents efforts in parenting the child.Are there parenting challenges and practices uniquely experienced by BIPOC grandparents? Are these practices adequate in meeting such challenges, e.g., stigma, discrimination at school, culturally driven bullying by age peers, biased school policies impacting BIPOC grandchildren? What are the implications of such issues for the design and implementation of interventions to improve the parenting skills (where necessary) among BIPOC grandfamilies? What roles do culturally grounded assumptions and values (i.e., cultural scripts) play in influencing child-rearing among such persons? What are the unique roles that grief, loss, and trauma play in understanding the evolution and ongoing development of life histories shaping parenting and child-rearing among BIPOC grandparent caregivers?My personal and professional experiences with grandparents reinforce my perspective that grandfamilies in general and BIPOC grandfamilies in particular are best understood in a developmental and contextual framework, which is dynamic in nature. BIPOC grandparents and their grandchildren develop and age just as other grandfamilies do. Do the developmental trajectories experienced by BIPOC grandfamilies parallel those of other grandparents? In this light, future research and practice should recognize the fact that the co-development of grandparent and grandchild is influenced not only by universal family life events, but also those that are cultural/societal in nature, such as policy- and service-related changes that impact grandfamilies in general (see Cox, 2019) and BIPOC grandfamilies in particular (e.g., societal bias against BIPOC grandparents, racial targeting).Ideally, coordinated longitudinal studies simultaneously targeting BIPOC and non-BIPOC grandparent caregivers can be carried out.Such a perspective should encompass key developmental transition points that BIPOC grandchildren experience, including entrance into school, puberty, graduation from high school/entrance into college or the work world, the grandchilds marriage and role as a parent. For such grandparents, these transitions might involve retirement, widow(er)hood, aging, incapacitation, or the need for care by the adult child whom the grandparent has raised. Are there interactions between these developmental choice points and the cultural/ethnic/racial histories? Do such histories influence how such choice points are experienced by BIPOC grandfamilies?These efforts to more fully understand the experiences of BIPOC grandparent caregivers will require well-planned longitudinal research that is not only prospective in nature, but also strikes a balance between the quantitative (e.g., based upon large secondary datasets) and the qualitative (i.e., focus group and interview/observational) work, necessarily based upon smaller samples (e.g., Baird et al., 2000; Byers et al., 2017; Hayslip et al., 2020; Mignon & Holmes, 2013) that reflect everyday life as it is lived from the perspective of the BIPOC grandparent. Ideally, coordinated longitudinal studies simultaneously targeting BIPOC and non-BIPOC grandparent caregivers can be carried out. The key here is asking real-world, ecologically grounded questions that are informed by the values, beliefs, traditions, rituals, and feelings of those BIPOC grandparents one seeks to understand.Even the most robust secondary dataset that is nomothetic in nature, emphasizing the generalizability of findings, cannot answer the questions I have raised here that reflect the everyday microsystemic aspects of BIPOC grandparent caregivers experiential lives. Instead, approaches to this necessary understanding can only be achieved by in-depth studies that involve qualitatively oriented interviews or focus groups, buttressed by a lived-experience focus. Only in this context can we understand variations in normative developmental trajectories as well as the choices and decisions BIPOC grandparents must make, created not only by illness, divorce, or death in the grandparents life, but also by a childs drug addiction, developmental disability, or depression.The above perspective on more fully understanding BIPOC grandfamilies also recognizes the fact that as grandfamilies themselves change as a function of the evolution of new cohorts of such caregivers and that BIPOC grandfamilies are embedded in an evolving cultural context. Thus, grandfamilies themselves change as a function of new cohorts and such caregivers. These processes of cultural evolution must be taken into account with regard to our sensitivity to diversity. Thus, research investigating cohort-specificity in grandfamilies will be necessary, underscored by the impact on all grandfamilies of both the opioid and fentanyl epidemics, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the parenting challenges posed by transgender grandchildren.My views on where the study of BIPOC grandfamilies might go in the future reflect and are limited by my experiences with diverse grandparent caregivers over the past several decades. I have learned as much about BIPOC grandparents and grandfamilies in general from conducting focus groups, small-groupintervention research, and one-on-one interviews as I have in conducting large sample questionnaire-based research. But I am left with more questions than answers.Learning more about grandfamilies will enrich our knowledge of BIPOC grandfamilies, which in turn will broaden our understanding of grandparent caregiving. Ultimately, we will come to see BIPOC grandfamilies and grandfamilies more generally as complementary to one another, where the whole of our knowledge base is not equal to the sum of its parts. Each contributes uniquely to our views about raising a grandchild, wherein diversity is not an afterthought, but instead is front and center, defining which services are needed, what policy developments are necessary, and in which directions research should proceed. Ultimately, the goals of BIPOC grandfamily research should be to not only better understand such grandfamilies in the context of how they are and are not unique, but also to contribute to the betterment of their health, well-being, and quality of life.Bert Hayslip, Jr., PhD, is Regents Professor of Psychology Emeritus at University of North Texas, and an expert in grandparenting, death and dying, grief and bereavement, psychopathology, intellectual functioning, and counseling as they apply to older adults.

Both are passionate advocates of grandparents raising grandchildren and have worked extensively on the ground with these populations.Theyre also big fans of one anothers work. Lustbader has used Simpsons Social Support and Survival Strategies of Older African American Grandmother Caregivers as a reading in her Family Healing class and mentioned, What an honor it has been to work together with her to assemble this special issue.Simpson returned the favor, saying, I was delighted when invited to serve as co-guest editor to this special edition with Wendy Lustbader . I appreciate her mentorship and guidance as we worked to complete this special issue.They were waiting for their daughters to pull their lives together so that the children could safely return to them.Lustbader first noticed grandparent caregivers as a social worker in the 1980s in subsidized elder housing projects in the Seattle area. There I encountered grandmothers who swore me to secrecy as they told me they had one or two grandchildren living with them. They would usher the children out the back exit to get them to school in the morning, fearing eviction if discovered, and would stand in line at food banks to extend what they could provide on their meager Social Security income.They were waiting for their daughters to pull their lives togetherto sober up, to get rid of abusive partners, to become good enough parentsso that the children could safely return to them.For decades, I followed the research and practice developments in this area as I gave trainings to Adult Protective Services workers across the country, raising awareness of grandparents who were protecting their grandchildren to the point of neglecting their own needs, added Lustbader.It was inner city Baltimore where Simpson had her first introduction to grandparent caregivers, in 1998, when she worked at Family Connections as a research assistant: From my dissertation I was able to publish several articles focused on their social supports, coping strategies and mental health. In addition, I presented at local and state agencies to help inform service providers about their challenges and resiliency strategies.Simpson moved on to rural counties in Missouri, engaging in qualitative research of grandmother caregivers and their service providers. They faced living in impoverished communities, affected by drugs, loss of employment opportunities and a strain in community resources. Such poverty results in structural inequalities and creates barriers for caregivers, she added.Now she engages in state presentations for the Missouri Juvenile Justice Association to inform juvenile justice service providers of the unique challenges facing Black grandmother caregivers. Her work sheds light on the systemic challenges these grandmothers endure, including limited access to community resources and support services.I recognized the importance of \"it takes a village\"to raise a child and I was fortunate to have this village of loving caregivers.In November 2014 Lustbader attended a presentation by a featured writer in this issue, Dr. LaShawnDa Pittman: I was stunned by her clarity as she reported what she had learned through interviewing 50 low-income custodial Black grandmothers in the Chicago area. She described their survival strategies at an unparalleled level of detail and insight. A section of this special issue is devoted to publishing the voices of these grandmothers for the first time.In Spring 2017, Lustbader taught workshops to front-line child welfare workers on how to conduct intergenerational assessments with the families they served. The sessions were intended to equip these workers with ways to motivate the middle generation to address any of their own personal trauma and to engage in treatment for substance abuse and mental health concerns. Lustbader noted: A key outcome of these training sessions reported in the evaluations was workers stating that they had gained awareness of the strengths and challenges of the grandparents who often play a central role in protecting these children behind the scenes.Simpson has a personal as well as professional motivation in her line of study, as she was cared for by her grandmother, grandfather, and extended family systems during difficult times.I recognized the importance of it takes a village to raise a child and I was fortunate to have this village of loving caregivers. I am passionate about bringing attention to caregivers whose villages are hampered by structural inequalities. We can no longer assume that African American grandmother caregivers, especially in skip-generational households, have the availability of community resources and family members to assist in their caregiving role, she said.Simpson hopes this issue reflects the challenges and resilience of grandparent caregivers and their significant contributions to rearing children in our society, as well as reflecting the racial and ethnic diversity of grandparenting across cultures. Her grander aims are that this issue informs policy and practice with a commitment to improve the support systems available to grandparent caregivers, ensuring they receive the necessary resources and recognition.She would like to see qualitative and quantitative longitudinal studies focused on grandparent caregivers across cultures. My current interest in the field of grandparenting is to engage in a qualitative study focused on the academic success of college students who were reared by their grandparents. I aim to research the psychological and social development of college students raised by grandparents and gain insights into self-identity, resilience, and coping mechanisms for academic achievements.Lustbader urges readers to consider Bert Hayslips recommendations for future research and development of services in the final article: Hayslip has given us the gift of summarizing the high points and take-aways of articles in this issue.Alison Biggar is ASAs editorial director.Photo credit: Shutterstock/SeventyFourYou may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202425Skipped Generation Households: A Snapshot of Preface for Three ArticlesBy LaShawnDa PittmanFebruary 05, 2025AbstractPrevious research has insufficiently investigated how grandparents in skipped-generation households (consisting only of grandparents and grandchildren) interpret and respond to childrens social, emotional, cognitive, and physical developmental needs. This article provides an overview of the prevalence of children raised in skipped-generation households and their developmental experiences and outcomes. It sheds light on the factors influencing parenting behavior and stress among grandparent caregivers.Key Wordsskipped-generation households, grandparent caregiving, child development, parenting behavior, parenting stressI have spent nearly two decades researching and advocating on behalf of grandfamilies, also known as skipped-generation households (consisting only of grandparents and grandchildren), initially as a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow conducting qualitative research for mydissertation turned book(2023). However, over the years, I have worked with various nonprofit organizations that provide direct service to these families and kinship support groups that offer refuge. An underexamined aspect of these caregivers experience is their difficulty responding to their grandchildren's developmental needs.As surrogate parents, the grandmothers in my study anticipated caring for their grandchildren as they had for their own children: changing diapers, preparing meals, helping with homework, and waking in the night to coax a toddler to the potty. But most grandmothers did not expect a secondary and more challenging set of childrearing demands, in particular, managing childrens physical and mental health challenges (including malnourishment) and the emotional difficulties they experienced as a result of being separated from their parent(s) or past experiences of trauma and child maltreatment.Most grandmothers did not anticipate developmental delays (e.g., learning gaps and disabilities) on par with those experienced by their grandchildren. Most grandmothers had little, if any, experience with childrearing issues of this magnitude. Most grandmothers also lacked the resources they needed to adequately address these childrearing issues, including the legal authority to tap into the institutional support their grandchildren required to address their developmental needs.Previous research on the parenting skills and practices of grandparents in skipped-generation households indicates that their parenting behaviors are contingent upon several interrelated factors, including financial resources, level of social support, grandparents physical and mental health, relationships with the childs biological parents, and the circumstances under which grandparents assumed responsibility for grandchildren (Monserud & Elder, 2011; Smith et al., 2008; Washington et al., 2013).Grandparents raising grandchildren report clinically significant parenting stress (Lee et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2020). Health-related limitations, psychological distress, and financial hardship have been found to increase their parenting stress (Hayslip et al., 2017). Furthermore, their parenting stress is shaped by having to adjust to the parenting role, ineffective parenting practices, and the psychosocial and behavioral difficulties many grandchildren raised by grandparents experience, including behavioral, emotional, and school-related problems (Hayslip et al., 2017; Pilkauskas & Dunifon, 2016; Xu et al., 2020).Children raised by grandparents are more likely than children raised by other caregivers to have behavioral and emotional problems.Overall, children raised by grandparents are more likely than those raised by biological parents to have problems in school, and to experience lower educational attainment, academic achievement, and socioemotional well-being (Monserud & Elder, 2011; Pilkauskas & Dunifon, 2016). They are also more likely than children raised by other caregivers to have behavioral and emotional problems (Pilkauskas & Dunifon, 2016; Smith et al., 2008), though one study found no significant differences (Solomon & Marx, 1995).A study using nationally representative data to compare the physical and mental health of children in different kinds of families (e.g., two-parent, blended stepparent, single-parent) found that children being cared for by grandparents in skipped-generation households had the poorest health status of any group of children, including behavioral/conduct problems, depression, anxiety, and an emotional, developmental, or behavioral problems requiring treatment or counseling (Bramlett et al., 2017).Recent research demonstrates that family setting/placement types (e.g., kinship care, foster care, or group home) influence child development (Bramlett et al., 2017; Washington et al., 2018) and outcomes later in life (Sacker et al., 2022). Although children in kinship care have worse developmental outcomes than children in the general population, they tend to fare better than children in nonrelative foster care, though not at accessing needed services (Bramlett et al., 2017). Children in kinship care report fewer mental health and behavioral problems and more educational competence than children in foster care (Dorval et al., 2020).However, a study examining well-being among children in kinship care with varying levels of involvement with the child welfare system found that children involved with the system had worse health (e.g., mental and physical health conditions, receipt of mental healthcare, special healthcare needs) and academic outcomes than those outside the child welfare system(Bramlett et al., 2017).Previous research has insufficiently investigated how grandparents in skipped-generation households interpret and respond to childrens social, emotional, cognitive, and physical developmental needs. Social development refers to childrens ability to create and sustain meaningful relationships with adults and other children. Emotional development refers to childrens ability to express, recognize, and manage their emotions (e.g., self-efficacy, self-control, etc.), as well as to respond appropriately to others emotions (e.g., develop empathy, accurately read and comprehend emotional states, etc.). Cognitive development covers thinking across the lifespan e.g., learning, problem-solving, creating, reasoning, conceptualizing, categorizing, remembering, planning, etc.). Physical development involves fine motor (small, precise) and gross (large) motor skills, as well as brain development.Although children grow at their own pace, developmental milestonesskills associated with how they play, learn, speak, behave, and moveprovide a general idea of expected maturational changes. Understanding how grandparents raising grandchildren in skipped-generation households make sense of and deal with childrens developmental needs is crucial for designing effective supports and services, especially given the number of children being raised by their grandparents.In 2023, 71.1% of children in the United States lived with two parents, 20.9% with their mother only, 4.2% with their father only, and 3.8% with no parent (U.S. Census Bureau, 2023). However, more than 2.4 million children (3%) lived in kinship care/grandfamilies (down from 4% in 2021; Grandfamilies and Kinship Support Network, 2024).Nearly 30% of U.S. children live with grandparents at some point.Recent research shows that these point-in-time estimates underestimate the number of U.S. children who live with their grandparents. Nearly 30% of U.S. children live with grandparents at some point. Approximately 5% of these children will live in skipped-generation households and 24.6% will live in three-generation households (Amorim et al., 2017). Though most grandparents raising their grandchildren are married (65.7%), women assume the bulk of caregiving responsibilities (63% versus 36.6% of men; Anderson et al., 2024).The articles featured in this issue on BIPOC grandfamilies fill gaps in the literature by drawing on qualitative data I collected from more than 70 Black grandmothers raising their grandchildren in skipped-generation households. Between 2007 to 2011, I interviewed these caregivers and conducted ethnographic research at doctors visits, welfare offices, school and daycare center appointments, as well as caseworker meetings.The average age of grandmothers in my study was 54, they were raising an average of 1.81 grandchildren for an average of 5.25 years, and they had an average of 3.36 children. Eighteen were married, 24 were divorced, 6 were in long-term partnerships, 4 were separated, 6 were widows, and the remainder were single. At the time of data collection, 20 of the women reported annual household incomes higher than $15,000the rest were impoverished.The federal poverty level (FPL) during the years of data collection for families of two, three, four, and eight were $13,690, $17,170, $20,650, and $34,570, respectively. Seventeen of the 20 women who reported income above the FPL had incomes of approximately 1.5 times the FPL, and 3 had annual household incomes of more than 2 times the FPL. Twenty-six of the women were working at the time of recruitment, 14 were retired, and the rest were unemployed (Pittman, 2023, p. 5).While data collection for this study took place from 2007 to 2011, Ive researched and advocated on behalf of this population for nearly 2 decades. This has included serving on the board of Innovative Solutions for Disadvantage and Disability in Atlanta, Georgia, during my tenure as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow in the sociology department at Georgia State University (see Pittman et al., 2016); serving on the Mayors Council on African American Elders (MCAAE) in Seattle, Washington (MCAAE advises government agencies and community organizations on policies, programs, and services benefitting older African Americans); and working with local kinship support groups and organizations, including the King County Kinship Collaboration Committee, which provides comprehensive and coordinated services, advocacy, and community education to support intergenerational kinship families.My ongoing involvement with this population confirms the continued relevance of the findings in these articles about how grandparents raising grandchildren in skipped-generation households strategize to meet childrens developmental needs.LaShawnDa Pittman, PhD, is an associate professor of Ethnic Studies and the Joff Hanauer Honors Professor of Western Civilization at the University of Washington in Seattle.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Inside Creative HouseReferencesAmorim, M., Dunifon, R., & Pilkauskas, N.

It begins with my journey into the field of grandparent caregiving as a doctoral student, then details findings from a study of low-income, African American grandmothers who were sole providers of their grandchildrens care. It explores factors affecting their capacity to help grandchildren overcome early adversity and what interfered with their ability to thrive on the margins. Findings revealed structural inequalities: destabilizing forces of drugs, community violence, and negative economic and social environmental disparities. Coping responses were influenced by resource availability. Grandmother caregivers minimized their mental and emotional health needs to care for grandchildren.Key Wordsgrandmother caregivers, genogram, ecomap, womanist perspective, ecological perspective, skipped-generation households, povertyIn this article, I seek to illuminate the experiences of grandmothers who are caring for grandchildren outside of the formal kinship care system and in the context of marginalized families and communities. This has been a focus of my research throughout my career, starting with my doctoral dissertation. I have used grounded theory methodology to explore the availability of family and community resources as well as coping processes by African American grandmothers who were the sole providers of their grandchildrens care.My intention has been to gain insight into the structure and functioning of these families and communities. I sought to understand what factors affected their capacity to help their grandchildren overcome early adversity and what interfered with their ability to thrive as grandmothers on the margins. It is clearer to me now than ever that identifying these factors and facing them squarely on both policy and practice levels is the only way we can make a significant cross-generational impact and improve the lives of these families.When I Entered the FieldMy life was changed when I served as a research assistant charged with collecting quantitative data through a formal questionnaire while interviewing grandmother caregivers. For each question, the grandmothers were supposed to select a number on the Likert scale that was most consistent with their experiences. Instead, they would tell me a story about their experience. After hearing the story, I would state, so your answer is 1, and they would continue with another story. Interviews that were supposed to last 2 hours were lasting 3 to 4 hours because this happened with every question.Initially, I was annoyed and frustrated because grandmothers refused to give me a single number. No matter how many times I asked for a number, I received a story. However, over time I learned that these elusive numbers meant little because they did not reflect the totality of these grandmothers lived experiences. At best, the numbers only represented fragmented aspects of what the grandmothers were going through. I learned that to fully capture the complexity of their circumstances, I had to be still and listen to their stories because they truly reflected the challenges faced by these women in rearing their grandchildren.Overall, I was shocked and dismayed to see that these households survived with minimal to no assistance from family members or the community. This challenged assumptions I had held based on my childhood experiences, where grandmother caregivers had a wealth of family and community resources to help them. At this point, I knew qualitative research methodology was the best approach to fully understand the unique lives of African American grandmother caregivers and to give voice to their experiences.What the Grandmothers Taught MeIn one of my first such studies, I interviewed seven African American grandmother caregivers who were no longer receiving services from Family Connections (1999), an agency that provided free community-based outreach services to families who had difficulty meeting the needs of their children in Baltimores West Side Empowerment Zone. The study took place across an 18-month period between 2000 and 2001. Each grandmother caregiver was interviewed three times in their home. Each interviewed lasted 90 minutes to 2 hours and was audio recorded.While interviewing the first participant, it became apparent to me that it was essential to use a genogram (a graphic representation of a family tree that displays detailed date on relationships among individuals) to capture caregivers variations in family history across two or three generations (McGoldrick & Gerson, 1985). The purpose was to have a diagrammatic view of who was present or absent in their family social support network. Information included sociodemographic characteristics, communication patterns, and developmental phases of family.To further assess and understand access to community resources, I employed an ecomap or ecological map developed by Hartman (1995), which provided a comprehensive examination of organizations, agencies, and community entities that caregivers called upon for assistance. Environmental domains included healthcare, school, church, and social service agencies. During and after the first interview, I mapped a genogram and ecomap for each grandmother and in the second interview this information was verified by caregivers.I bonded with grandmother caregivers by sharing personal life experiences and often assisted them with daily household tasks.Over the course of the study, I bonded with grandmother caregivers by sharing personal life experiences and often assisted them with daily household tasks (e.g., cleaning and caring for young children) and acquiring community resources. In many situations, grandmother participants were busy preparing meals and managing abundant household tasks when I arrived, and I stepped in to provide concrete assistance. For example, when I visited Mrs. Jones (fictitious name), she was in the kitchen, feeding two young grandchildren in their highchairs and sweeping a cracked bottle of jelly from the kitchen floor. When I entered, I asked her how I could help. She immediately stated, You can change that babys diaper, so he can stop screaming. I quickly jumped into action.It was important to help the grandmothers, if only to secure a private and comfortable context for eventually conducting the interview. I also gained a real sense of the continual pressures in their lives and how difficult it was to carve out any kind of personal space. Caring for young children without other family members available to step in means, truly, there is no rest for the weary.Later in the study, I attended a funeral with one of the grandmothers whose adult daughter had died from a drug overdose. Because of this grandmothers strong faith, she had always believed that her daughter would recover and one day return to take full responsibility for her children. The passing of her adult child solidified her role of grandmother caregiver, possibly for as long as she lived.Depleted Community ResourcesAll of the grandmothers believed their communities were supposed to be villages that shared in raising the children. They recounted early memories about mutual helping between families they had experienced growing up. Grandmothers spoke of a time when there was reciprocity and commitment to one another, and their communities were strong and viable. But the current reality differed greatly and resulted in unique challenges to their caregiving needs.Participants voiced frustration with the destabilizing forces of drugs, community violence, and the negative economic and social environmental conditions affecting community members across generations. Traditional helping resources for sustainability and survival were undermined, as poignantly illustrated by Mrs. Truth, a 74-year-old widowed grandmother caring for seven grandchildren (ages 214). Her concerns collectively represent other grandmothers voices:Its a big difference back then and now. People back then, everybody cared about everybody. You know, when you were a neighbor, you were neighbors ... you were there if anybody was sick, you were there! They needed help, you were there. Now, you can get sick and die and nobody will know, they just doesnt care. Everybodys wrapped in themselves! (Simpson & Lawrence-Webb, 2009, p. 835).When grandmothers were questioned about seeking services to meet their caregiving needs, they viewed social service agencies as being out of touch in their decision-making and recommendations concerning services for the children. Ms. C. described how she sought help from human service agencies when she lacked the money to buy clothing for her grandchildren:When I moved over to East Baltimore and, let me see, the childrens worker had came out and I had asked her about if I could get them some school clothes. And she told me her supervisor would not sign the papers for it [school clothes]. And I told her, I said, Well, yall might as well get these children cuz I cannot take care of these children! I have to give em up because I done went to my limit. ... I done moved all over town with these children trying to hold on to em, but I cant get no help you know. And my son, he came up and I started telling him about they didnt have no clothes and I was giving them up. That was a time, too. He cried and I cried. ... I am tearful just to think of that I almost gave them up (Simpson & Lawrence-Webb, 2009, p. 838).Four of her five adult children and 10 of her 13 siblings died over a 3-year period due to drug overdose, community violence, and medical conditions.Ms. C.s quote captures the exasperation grandmother caregivers experience when seeking resources from human service and community agencies. It is fortunate that Ms. C.s adult son, uncle to the grandchildren, had the resources to purchase clothing for them. This finding, that grandmothers viewed the culture of social service agencies (macro system) as inappropriate and unresponsive for their role as grandparent caregivers, confirms previous research that found that grandmothers receiving appropriate services are hindered by social service policies and workers attitudes (Connealy & DeRoos, 2000; Gibson, 2002; Minkler & Roe, 1993). These findings are consistent with the literature that found caregivers are disappointed and frustrated with service providers (Carr et al., 2012).Fragile FamiliesEnvironmental challenges at the macro level had a direct influence on their micro-level systems, specifically, grandmothers ability to rely on supportive resources within their family structure. Grandmother caregivers stated that family members want to help, but they reported a lack of consistent and reliable support from relatives who were also coping with poor health, the lack of affordable housing, and the blow of reduced incomes. Their ability to function as an extended family and aid one another was fundamentally affected by these societal strains of unequal access to healthcare, housing, and income.Generational problems were graphically depicted in the grandmothers genograms. These exosystem forces (environmental factors that influence a persons development) had a severe crippling effect on interpersonal family relationships among family members, undermining the intimate familial social support structures necessary for the healthy maintenance of family systems. According to Ms. F., four of her five adult children and 10 of her 13 siblings died over a 3-year period due to drug overdose, community violence, and medical conditions.When asked who would care for her grandchild if she were not capable, she replied, No one, cuz the ones that I would [have relied on], they dead! Ms. F.s sister, who died of cancer, had been the designated caregiver of her grandchildren.Another grandmother, age 53 and caring for four grandchildren, described how family members are coping daily with poverty, health, and their own responsibilities:My oldest sister, shes got, what is it, cerebral palsy, so that makes her, she cant get around too good ... And my next oldest sister, shes a foster mother, so she got about four foster kids of her own, and a little grand boy. And my next sister, shes a heart patient, so shes not capable of taking care of them or helping me. ... My next sister she works, and she has three kids of her own, so shes not capable of really helping me. All of them have their own responsibility. And if they could help, like I say, they may call on the phone, do a little talking (Simpson, 2009, p. 32).Although this grandmother could not count on these family members for daily assistance, her family was able to help during times of crisis. For example, when she had a damaging house fire several years ago that displaced her grandchildren for several months, she relied on family members for temporary shelter.Coping ResourcesIn this section, I turn to the ways African American grandmother caregivers cope when faced with unreliable social support from family and community. In the context of unreliable social support, two survival strategies emerged: being strong and self-sacrificing. These were survival strategies caregivers employed when there were minimal to no supportive resources to help them maintain their caregiving role. Being strong was a culturally appropriate and expected survival strategy when faced with adversity.Being strong meant that they maintained a false sense of self-composure by not revealing their true feelings. This sense of self-composure was important for it allowed them not to emotionally break down under adversity. For example, Mrs. Truth had two sons who died from drug addiction between 1995 and 1996 and was caring for their offspring. She said, And sometimes, honey, its not easy. Its so hard to, I just dont cry anymore; I cried out. And crying dont help. And Im at the point now that if I start crying, I will never stop. I wont know how to stop because Ive held it back so long and I went through so much with my second husband and his family. And then I lost my two sons back-to-back; and there wasnt no one that I could lean on. So there had to be nobody but God that brought me through all of this a couple of times this year I feel like I wanted to cry, just wanted to holler and scream. But I knew I couldnt do that because if I did that, they wouldnt of have no one because Id would of been gone. And I just cant give in to those kinds of things because it bothers me and it hurts. Ive never cried behind either one of my sons because thats their life (Simpson et al., 2017, p. 36).And Im at the point now that if I start crying, I will never stop.Embedded in Mrs. Truths statement was that she had to be emotionally strong in order to continue her role as a caregiver. She was left with the responsibility of caring for her grandchildren; to allow feelings associated with sadness and grief would interfere with her caregiving role. Her statement, it bothers me and it hurts, revealed that she was feeling pain associated with these losses and her added responsibility of caring for others. However, dwelling on these feelings would only weaken her resolve and her ability to care for others.Attributes of self-sacrificing captured the survival strategies of caregivers who did not have time for themselves. They often did not enjoy a personal life outside of caregiving. Self-sacrificing captured the lived experiences of African American caregivers who had to rely on their own internal resources to meet their personal needs and grandchildrens needs. This was a necessary survival skill for grandmother caregivers who had fewer resources in their informal and/or formal social support.Women acted in this capacity because they needed help from family but often this help was not forthcoming. When grandmothers were asked about why they engaged in self-sacrificing behavior, they consistently responded that asking for help was not the problem; rather, they did not know who was available to provide help. As stated by Ms. Chinn, a 65-year-old caring for two grandchildren, I ask for help and dont get it a lot [of] times. Ask for help and dont get it! Ms. Coppin, age 68, caring for three grandchildren related, Well, some people have help in their households from their grandmothers or aunts, uncles who raise them. But they also have a younger, a sister-in-law or might [have a] daughter or somebody in the household. I dont have anybody in my household to do anything (Simpson et al., 2017, pg. 37).ConclusionThe challenges grandmother caregivers face are largely dictated by their location in the social hierarchy. As such, concerns expressed by these grandmothers reflect their unique position in society. Primarily because they are African American, female, and of limited economic independence, they are faced with distinctly challenging realities. Grandparent caregivers in most studies are living on the margins with lower income, less education, and poorer health, all consistently documented as common realities among African American grandmother caregivers (Montoro-Rodriguez & Ramsey, 2019). The assumption that most African American grandmother caregivers have the resources within their family and extended kin networks to help them with caregiving roles has long been undermined by social and economic conditions (Simpson, 2009). The structural and functional aspects of informal social support networks among vulnerable, at-risk families may create challenges and barriers to caregivers receiving supports and resources.Given the cultural tradition of African American families to rely upon extended kin, it is imperative that we focus greater attention on who is present and absent, and their roles and functions within the grandmothers informal social support structure. In meeting the needs of vulnerable African American families, it is crucial that intervention strategies are aimed at kin networks for restoring, sustaining, and maintaining resiliency features and cultural strengths that are necessary for their survival and coping. Treatment/intervention services need to be directed toward family members who provide support and those who may not be able to provide support because of drug addiction, medical conditions or poverty.Social work clinical treatment/intervention plans generally focus on the parent(s) and child. Minimal attention is directed at extended kin or non-kin who may be possible sources of support. Providing direct services in the family system is important when working with African American grandmother caregivers. Providing intergenerational support may include services directed at biological parents, extended kin and family members who are potential sources of support for grandmothers who are caring for their grandchildren. Supporting the intergenerational survival of the entire family is important in meeting the needs of African American grandmother caregivers.Findings of caregivers coping habits showed their coping responses were influenced by interactions with their informal and formal social support structures. Findings revealed that some grandmother caregivers minimized their mental and emotional health needs to care for their grandchildren. Clinicians need to pay greater attention to directing services at the caregiver and ensuring their emotional and health needs are adequately met.Gaynell M.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202425Empowering Grandparent Caregivers Via In-Person and Virtual ProgramsBy Carole CoxFebruary 05, 2025TagsInnovation & Social ImpactEquity & JusticeAbstractEmpowerment programs for grandparent caregivers can serve to support and enhance the roles of grandparents in the community and family. Traditionally such programs have been offered in-person, with the leader acting as facilitator. In 2021, in-person programs, first developed in 1998, were transformed into a virtual format, offered via Zoom, to meet COVID-19 challenges. This article discusses how traditional and virtual programs are effective in addressing the concerns of families and the importance of each program modality being made available and accessible to grandparent caregivers.Key Wordsempowerment, roles, challenges, in-person, virtualThe goals of empowerment practice are to help clients achieve a sense of personal power, become more aware of connections between individual and community problems, develop skills, and learn to work collaboratively toward social change (Guitierrez et al., 1998). Among the many definitions of empowerment are the ability to influence the people, organizations, and environment that affect ones life (Hasenfeld, 1987); gaining, developing, seizing, enabling, or giving power (Staples, 1990); and attaining control over ones life, including further participation in the community (Katz, 1984).In the empowerment process, the practitioner does not act as the expert or provider of power to the powerless older person but is instead a co-learner. The role of the group leader is that of a facilitator who recognizes that participants are experts, that they learn best from each other, and that their problems are not unique. The process involves four key elements: 1) attitude, values, and beliefsdeveloping a sense of self-efficacy, belief in self-worth, and an internal locus of control; 2) validation of collective experiencesrecognizing that experiences are shared rather than individual to decrease self-blame; 3) knowledge and skills for critical thinkinglearning to think critically about problems and the factors contributing to them; and 4) actionlearning to develop action strategies that influence others and work toward goals (Cox & Parsons, 1994).Strategies to foster empowerment are commonly practiced in groups. Within a group, participants share concerns, learn from one another, and practice specific techniquesfor instance, grandparents demonstrated effective ways of listening and responding to children to encourage communication. As participants become comfortable with these techniques, they are encouraged to use them in other settings. Role-playing and the use of videos can help reinforce new behaviors. Through the group, participants acquire information and skills that can assist them in parenting, relationships, and resolving their problems.All the above concerns directly impact grandparents who are raising their grandchildren and are continually challenged by these roles and their accompanying stresses. Consequently, empowerment training is an important intervention that can increase grandparent caregivers abilities, provide information, and strengthen relationships. This article details my experiences in developing and offering in-person and virtual empowerment groups for grandparent caregivers and their outcomes.BackgroundIn 1998, I developed the Grandparent Empowerment Program, which was followed byEmpowering Grandparent Caregivers: A Manual for Group Leaders(Cox, 2000). The program, originally supported for 3 years by a private foundation in New York City, was incorporated into the Grandparent Resource Center (GRC) of the NYC Department for the Aging and continued in this role until July 2023, when the GRC was discontinued, with grandparents being transferred to other caregiving support programs.The original program was developed in conjunction with the Grandparent Empowerment Movement of the Harlem Interfaith Counseling Service, Inc., of New York City. The program included 14 three-hour classes: Understanding Empowerment, The Importance of Self-Esteem, Communication, Dealing with Behavior Problems, Talking about Sex and Drugs, Dealing with Loss and Grief, Navigating the Service System, Legal and Entitlement Issues, Advocacy, and Making Presentations (some subjects required two classes). All classes were offered in a classroom at Fordham University, a feature that was empowering as it allowed the grandparents to frequently interact with social work students. Also, the universitys Dean visited the first class of each cohort to welcome grandparent students and introduce the program.All classes were offered in a classroom at the university, a feature that was empowering as the grandparents frequently interacted with social work students.Empowerment in the family and in the community was the class focus, with grandparents developing parenting skills as well as advocacy abilities they could use to obtain more needed resources for grandparent-headed families (Cox, 2002). Each participant received the complete curriculum of all class materials, enabling them to study before the class, as well as ensuring continued access to the curriculum.Classes began with a review of the material for the week and discussion. Grandparents were expected to discuss how they had used a particular approach from the weeks material and its result. For instance, classes on communication concentrated on the importance of listening and responding to the children. The homework was to report on how these skills were used with their grandchildren and the grandchildrens responses.Discussions were an integral part of the education as grandparents became comfortable sharing and listening to each other, often benefiting from suggestions from other grandparents. This approach contributed to the groups development, while also underscoring the role of the group leader as a facilitator rather than a powerful authority. In addition, as several grandparents were illiterate or not literate in English, the discussions were an important resource for their learning.Role-play was frequently used, with participants playing the role of grandchildren interacting with grandparents. Although many were at first reticent, it became a favorite activity and an important part of the empowerment process. The role-plays offered the opportunity to understand grandchildrens perspectives and their experiences. In some instances, participants assumed the role of service providers, which led to interesting discussions of ways to respond to those perceived as unsupportive of or negative about their concerns. For example, one grandmother reported that the eligibility worker at the human resources office had said, If you had done a better job with your own children, you would not be here today. Obviously, this stimulated many comments!All classes were offered at the university and participants felt integrated into the campus. As one grandparent said, I only went through third grade and my reading is very limited, and now I am at university! When they completed the course, their achievement was recognized by a formal graduation at the university with graduates marching to Pomp and Circumstance, speakers, diplomas, and large audiences including family and guests. Grandparents and grandchildren were encouraged to speak at the graduation, too. These short talks were empowering, as participants presented to a large audience about the program and its impact.Particularly important were spontaneous remarks of grandchildren sharing their experiences of being raised by a grandparent: If it wasnt for my grandmother, I would not be here today, My grandma is the most important person in my life, and If I could give my grandma anything, it would be the whole wide world. Such statements publicly underscored the importance of the grandparents and increased their sense of empowerment.Cultural DiversityThe curriculum was translated into Spanish and Russian with facilitators, fluent in the respective languages, co-leading the sessions. The programs all followed the same protocol, which emphasized group discussions, responses, and using the skills learned in the programs. In addition, the program was taken to Tanzania, where it was translated into Swahili and offered to 20 caregiving grandparents living in the countryside outside of Dar Es Salaam (Cox & Minor, 2014).Culture can be influential in shaping roles and behaviors. For many grandparent caregivers, assuming the responsibility of raising grandchildren fulfills familial responsibilities. As I heard many times, grandparents said they stepped in as they did not want the children to go into the system.However, culture is not a constant. Adherence to traditions and values varies with acculturation. Some grandparents who are immigrants may be stressed by grandchildren who are more assimilated into U.S. culture and do not respect traditional expectations or behaviors. In working with any specific caregiver, knowledge of specific group norms and values is crucial, but it is essential not to make assumptions about the adherence of the individual family (Cox, 2018).If I could give my grandma anything, it would be the whole wide world.Culture can affect the willingness to discuss and share personal experiences in a group setting. For instance, Latino and Russian grandparents were more reticent about discussing personal experiences than were Black grandparents, who were open to sharing family issues, problems, and disappointments. Recognizing such differences is important for empowerment as it seeks to encompass and build upon such cultural nuances (Cox, 2014). One example is the role of discipline in Tanzanian families, where grandparents appeared to be quick to hit rather than listen. At the programs completion, discussions with the children found they were most appreciative that their grandparents were listening to them rather than spanking.Culturally competent interventions demand knowledge about discrimination, history of access to services, and how such factors may influence trust in providers. The willingness to use services also is affected by language, because the inability to communicate with providers can be a formidable barrier to using services. Understanding legal concerns and relations to formal agencies is particularly important to groups likely to be impacted by immigration policies. Cultural competence necessitates an understanding of the background, policies, and service availability and accessibility.Virtual EmpowermentSupport for grandparent caregivers became more critical in 2020 with the surge of COVID-19 as children and grandparents dealt with isolation and new school challenges. COVID-19 isolation further contributed to grandparents doubting their parenting abilities, particularly as many children struggled to adapt to online learning. Moreover, the virus was a formidable barrier to support as it undermined access to services, traditional support groups, in-person counseling, respite assistance, and case management services (Generations United, 2021).In response to the urgent needs of these grandparents, in 2020 the in-person empowerment program was transformed into a virtual program offered via Zoom. A grant from the NYC Department for the Aging (DFTA) provided WiFi to 350 public housing tenants as well as basic education on the use of technology. These assets provided the foundation for the program.Adaptation from In-Person to VirtualThe virtual program was reduced from 14 to 7 classes, each 60 minutes, with additional time available for individual counseling with participants. The adjustment was made in recognition that many grandparents were caring for their grandchildren and might also be caring for another relative who had COVID-19.Specific classes were selected in conjunction with the staff of DFTA and included: 1) The Nature and Importance of Empowerment; 2) The Importance of Self-esteem in Children; 3) Dealing with Behavioral Issues; 4) Grief and Loss; 5) Communication; 6) Talking About Sex; and 7) Making Effective Presentations. As in the traditional program, the virtual program sought to empower grandparents in the family and the community.Within 2 weeks of publicizing the program, 70 grandparents had registered for the training. Classes were limited to 15 participants. The only prerequisites were that they were raising their grandchildren and that they could connect to WIFI. The program continued until July 2023 and has graduated almost 100 grandparents.Most participants were Black grandparents of low income who lived in public housing in New York City. Like in-person classes, each participant received the weeks class material via email. Grandparents were expected to be familiar with the readings and prepared to discuss them in class. They also were expected to apply the lessons learned to interactions with their grandchildren and report on its impact.Similar to in-person groups, communication and childrens self-esteem were favorite topics. However, one subject that surfaced during classes was dealing with grief. Several families had experienced the loss of a relative to COVID-19, and consequently, the classes on how children grieve and how to deal with a childs grief, as well as ones own, were particularly relevant.The fact that the children were now learning at home was a challenge for many participants who were unsure of how their children were doing with the computers and were concerned about their learning. One grandmother was dubious about her 12-year-old grandsons work quality but was hesitant to contact the teacher. Participants shared how this could be done and its possible importance, even helping the grandmother rehearse her conversation with the teacher. The grandmother returned to the next session excited and eager to discuss how she had contacted the teacher, how pleased the teacher was that she had called, and how the teacher even called her back to talk some more. She truly felt empowered.The program has graduated almost 100 grandparents.Also, having classes at home can be empowering for the children. Often, they would come into the room and see their grandparent on Zoom taking a class to be a better grandparent. One grandson was asked what he thought about it, responding, Its cool.Another grandmother reported that her granddaughter (who had been listening to the class on behavior) told her, You cant do that, your teacher would not like it. A teenage boy about whom the grandmother was very concerned happened to walk into the class and was questioned. He was smiling as he responded, Granma just doesnt understand computers, I am doing really well in class. Then he displayed his homework, and got applause from the group. This unexpected benefit of the virtual program is that it can empower both generations, reaffirming to the children their importance in their grandparents lives.It is important to note that participants exchanged phone numbers as well as email contacts. Given the isolation many were experiencing, they developed a solid network of others going through the same experiences. Even in normal times, raising a grandchild can be isolating as it can limit socialization. Virtual groups can be an important means of ensuring grandparents remain included in their networks and society.ConclusionEmpowerment programs focusing on strengthening the parenting skills and social advocacy ability of grandparent caregivers have traditionally been taught in person. They focus on increasing parenting skills as well as strengthening grandparent abilities to be empowered in the community. Rather than acting as experts, the group is encouraged to discuss and participate in sessions. The focus of the programs is to empower grandparents in the home and in the community, where they can become active in advocating for policies and services that can further support them and their families.Being knowledgeable about participants culture can be critical in understanding roles and responses. Being knowledgeable about discrimination and the history of a specific group is critical for sensitive interventions and understanding relationships to empowerment. At the same time, cultural competence guards against generalizations about any individual and their adherence to a specific culture and traditions, which may influence their behaviors.Although empowerment programs are usually in-person, virtual empowerment can be an effective tool for grandparents, particularly for those unable to attend in-person group meetings. Grandparents are eager to learn and use technology. The virtual programs support networking and relationships among participants. A major advantage of virtual programs is that they are not confined to a specific area or community. There are no boundaries restricting eligibility and thus they are accessible to those living in areas where there are no support services.Virtual programs are an important means of fostering social inclusion and combating isolation, conditions that affect many grandparent caregivers who are restricted due to their health or child-rearing responsibilities. However, resources that give them access to the technology and teach them how to use it are essential (Wilson et al., 2021).A recent study from the Pew Research Center (Faverio, 2022) found that although the use of digital technology has increased among people ages 65 and older, they are less likely to have access to home broadband or to use the Internet than younger people. It is important to combat ageism and stereotypes that older people cannot learn or do not want to use technology as such stereotypes may limit availability of the services and act as barriers to program expansion. Policies that contribute to accessibility are essential because these older adults, comparable to others in society, are eager to connect.In todays world technology and the ability to connect with others via computers is fundamental to inclusion. The importance of overcoming the connectivity gap was recognized in the federal 2020Affordable Connectivity Program. The Program offered discounts on Internet connection and devices to low-income people whose income was 200% or less than the poverty guidelines. At the time of the Acts termination in June 2024, more than 23 million households were enrolled in the program, with nearly half headed by someone older than age 50 (Federal Communications Commission, 2024). Efforts are being made to reinstate funding for the program as connecting is fundamental for everyone (Rosenworcel, 2024).Finally, there is a need for in-person and virtual empowerment programs and both should be available and accessible to grandparents. Those able and interested in attending in-person groups where they feel comfortable and enjoy the personal connections with others should have access to these programs. Concomitantly, grandparents whose obligations, health, or geography limit their ability to attend in-person groups must have the opportunity for access to virtual programs.Carole Cox, MSW, PhD, is a professor of Social Work at the Graduate School of Social Service, Fordham University, in New York City.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202425Getting Grandchildren Back on Their FeetBy LaShawnDa PittmanFebruary 05, 2025TagsHealth & Well-beingEconomic SecurityEquity & JusticeAbstractThis article examines how grandmothers raising grandchildren in skipped-generation households tended to their grandchildrens physical development, including 1) treating illnesses and injuries; 2) alleviating malnourishment and teaching healthy eating habits; and 3) managing prenatal substance exposure. Childrens physical needs often required grandmothers to interact with healthcare providers, which required demonstrating proof of legal authority. Grandmothers raising grandchildren must overcome legal complications to tend to their grandchildrens physical needs, and they did so by using Child Protective Services to become legal guardians, devising strategies to overcome their lack of legal authority, and taking on the caregiving arrangements required by the state.Key Wordsphysical development, physical needs, prenatal substance exposure, parenting, grandparent caregiving, skipped-generation households, grandfamily, kinship care, legal rights/authorityAt first, they were so sick. They were so sick . So, I got em back on they feet. I got em on they feet.Cheryls description of the state of her five grandchildrens health when they entered her care echoed the experiences of many of the grandmothers raising grandchildren whom I interviewed on the South Side of Chicago. Childrens unanticipated health demands required grandmothers to go beyond preparing healthy meals, curing routine ailments (colds, flu, broken limbs), and ensuring regular doctor check-ups.In many cases, caring for childrens health involved 1) treating illnesses and injuries; 2) alleviating malnourishment and teaching healthy eating habits; and 3) managing prenatal substance exposure. Getting and keeping their grandchildren healthy often involved accessing healthcare, which required that grandmothers demonstrate proof of legal authority. To access healthcare they presented the childs medical card, provided proof of legal guardianship, and/or used their Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) paperwork or used a caseworker. In lieu of legal rights, they devised strategies such as building trusted relationships with medical providers, relying on parents, and giving verbal confirmation of legal authority even when they did not have it.Treating Illnesses and InjuriesCheryl, whose quote begins this article, described her five grandchildrens health when she assumed responsibility for them:Shandra had ringworm all in her head, all over her body. And Jamal had ringworm stuck all on his skin ... from sleeping on the floor on nasty stuff. I took em to the doctor. I put antibacterial on it and all. I went through shit. And they was half-eating. They used to half-eat.Cheryl, 52, took pride in nurturing her grandchildren (Tevin, 19; Keith, 16; Shandra, 13; Jamal, 10; and Sienna, 8) back to health.She said, Sienna just as fat now as she could be. She big, she weighs more than Jamal. And Shandra you look at her how much you think she weigh? She 13 years old and weigh 273 pounds. Cheryl was able to get her grandchildren medical attention by calling DCFS and was given the number to the guardianship program ... they come out, fill the papers out, and told me I had to go to court in front of the judge. And thats how I got it.Like many grandmothers, Cheryl became her grandchildrens legal guardian to ensure they remained in her care and to secure desperately needed resources and services, specifically public aid benefitsmedical cards, cash assistance, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In addition to getting proper diagnoses for her grandchildren and treatment for their developmental disabilities and other medical conditions (eczema, vision problems, and asthma) Cheryl was able to get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for her grandson Tevin. At the time of the interview, Cheryl was in the process of taking Shandra to the La Rabida Hospital and putting her on that weight-loss program.Michelle, 47, didnt know she was a grandmother until one day her son Curtis called and said, Mama, I need a favor. Mama, see I got a son. I only got one child by her. And DCFS aint quite in her life, but its been in her life. So, Im gonna need you, if you can, take care of my son.Not only did Curtis need his mother to take care of his son Efrem, but he also needed her to manage her grandsons child welfare system involvement. Efrems mother, Khalima, had four other children who were all in the care of relatives serving as kinship foster care providers. The reason the initial DCFS case was opened was never made clear to Michelle. But both the caseworker who contacted Michelle and Khalima shared a similar story that largely had to do with living in impoverished conditions, neglect, and not fulfilling the permanency plan (also known as reunification program or case plan) needed to get her children back.Permanency plans are services that must be fulfilled by parents to be reunited with their children, including parenting classes, rehab, therapy sessions, and so on. According to the caseworker, Khalima wasnt applying to her service, the house had too many inhabitants, the babys not properly in clothing. The baby nasty. The babys not eating properly, and it was Curtis who takes care of the baby most of the time. Khalima either there or not there.Sixty-three-year-old Marthas story exemplifies how some childrens injuries that grandmothers had to get treated were caused by a parent.Voluntary placement agreements (VPAs) can be voluntarily agreed upon by parents or guardians without formal removal of children from their homes and placement into kinship care; or when children are constructively removed from their parents or guardians home while they are being looked after by another caregiver on a temporary basis (Pittman, 2023, p. 263). For Michelle, the shock of being a new grandmother, a young grandmother, and a grandmother of a grandchild who came into her care through a voluntary placement agreement was complicated by trying to get the required documentation (birth certificate, medical card) to care for an infant. She had only recently received his temporary medical card when Efrem had his first asthma attack in her care.She described, So, within that time [of seeking the necessary documentation] one night he started gasping. Im like, Baby, whats wrong with you? He was coughing a lot, so I thought it was a cold, but he was starting to change color, and Im like, Oooh we got to take him to the emergency room. Shot him to the emergency room. Come to find out he was getting an asthma attack Lord forgive me with the words, Them kids didnt let me know a damn thing ... Making me go through all of this! Thats the first thing they should have told me about. Well mama he got this and you know? Lord Jesus, at the hospital, Who is the mama? Wheres the mama? I am the mama right now. No, you dont know all that paperwork. I said, [Laughter] Right now he just needs to be seen.I said, Im the guardian. Im the grandmother. [They said,] Okay. Well grandmama just calm down. Hes just goin through an asthma attack. We just gonna put him on a machine. And he fightin and stuff like that. Dont want it on his face and stuff. Got to hold him down. And, tryin to get him to breathe, and finally, she gave him a couple of Tylenol, Motrin, and he calmed down.Michelle was simultaneously furious and afraid. They kept Efrem overnight, connected Michelle with his pediatrician, and gave her one of the breathing inhalers, pump sprays like that. And told me to spray at the first sign of coughing most time, thats how it starts, the cough starts coming in and stuff like that.After being scolded by Michelle, Curtis and Khalima brought her Efrems asthma medications. As Michelle cared for Efrem over the next 3 years, she continued to manage his asthma and got him treated for vision problems.Sixty-three-year-old Marthas story exemplifies how some childrens injuries that grandmothers had to get treated were caused by a parent. Martha learned from her oldest daughter, Terri, that Kellen (a grandson who Martha had raised) and his girlfriend, Erika, were abusing their 1-year-old twins, Akram and Akria, and 2-year-old Phallon. She was told of and later witnessed the parents neglecting, beating, and verbally abusing the children but did not live close enough to intervene.With the childrens grandmother unwilling to assume responsibility for her grandchildren and Erika estranged from her family, Martha saw no alternative but to increase her involvement with her great-grandchildren. But at that point, her intentions were only to help the young couple parent better. Martha got an opportunity to intervene when Kellen asked if he could come home. She rented a truck, moved Kellen and his family into her home, gave them a room, and confirmed her suspicion of child abuse. But, Martha reasoned, Erika was also contending with intergenerational trauma:They was neglecting em. They was beatin the little 2-year-old girl. One time she [Erika] had whipped her so until that baby had bruises all on her back. ... I think somethings wrong with her [Erika] because she came up in the system. Everybody came up in the system is not bad, but ... she was abused before she got in the system.Since Erika had been sexually abused by her mothers boyfriend, Martha reasoned that she might not view her behavior as abusive. But when Martha tried to provide parental guidance, Erika made it clear that she did not want to be told how to raise her children. I had to call the police on her, Martha disclosed, because she had even threatened me.Eventually Martha realized that she could no longer keep her great-grandchildren safe in her capacity as their grandmother. Despite Marthas compassion for Erika, she could not permit child abuse: And I talked to her, I pleaded with her. And I told her if they keep on, I was gonna call DCFS on em. So, I did.When, like so many grandmothers in this study, she was pushed to using or threatening to use punitive institutions to protect her grandchildren, Martha called DCFS, and Kellen and his family left her home. When, a week later, they returned because they had nowhere else to go, Martha told them the children were welcome, but not Erika.She said, They wouldnt even bring me they shot records because they hadnt been taking the kids to the doctor. I had a hard time. She called a local social service agency providing support to kinship caregivers and they helped her become her great-grandchildrens legal guardian and to gain access to the resources and services the children needed.Martha stated, They wouldnt let me take em to the doctor and I knew the kids needed to go to the doctor. They wasnt sick or anything but they needed to go to the doctor and I was worried about they shots. So, they [social service agency staff] told me how to go about getting medical cards for the kids. I got the medical cards for the kids and the kids is on my food stamps . So its just that they needed medical attention and to help me buy food.Martha, Michelle, and Cheryls stories show that because of the often abrupt and unexpected nature of grandparent caregiving, grandmothers frequently had to immediately address their grandchildrens neglected health. Their stories demonstrate the necessity of legal authority (or strategies in the absence of legal authority) among grandparents trying to get their grandchildren the healthcare they needed.Alleviating MalnourishmentMalnourished children were described by grandmothers as small for their age or barely eating. Their poor and irregular eating habits were evident in stunted growth, rotten teeth, and difficulty consuming healthy foods. In response, grandmothers went to great lengths to ensure their grandchildren were adequately fed.Lottie, 58, and her husband had been compelled to provide care when Lotties newborn granddaughter Audra tested positive for drug exposure and the hospital contacted DCFS, who transferred care of Lotties three grandchildren to her via kinship diversion (where children are diverted to kinship care as an alternative to being brought into state custody [formal foster care]. It is used interchangeably with terms such as safety planning, voluntary kinship care, parental placement, redirection, informal kin care, and prevention services.).I got attached to her [Dana] ... I would literally go [to her parents home] and make sure she ate I was gonna make sure she ate.When Rachel couldnt regain custody because of substance addiction and untreated mental illness, Lottie became their legal guardian. Lottie described how her two grandsons (9-year-old Garrian and 7-year-old Joshua) were malnourished when they entered her care, as well as her strategy for nurturing them back to health:When I got em they were real thin. I told em, God, yall are so skinny you could pass between two blocks of rain and not even get wet. So, when I started to feed em I say, You eat til you get full. So now they full because they big. Before becoming her grandchildrens primary caregiver, Lottie participated in the EarnFare program, which is designed to provide adults who receive SNAP benefits and who volunteer an opportunity to gain valuable work experience, earn cash assistance, and become self-sufficient (Illinois Department of Human Services, n.d.). After assuming responsibility for her grandchildren, Lottie parlayed her volunteer experience into a full-time job at a branch agency of DCFS. She relied on her job, which not only paid her but gave her access to the food pantry, to keep her grandchildren well fed.Audra, she likes sardines. She loves them so I get little snacks like that. Then I got one thats allergic to peanut butter and one thats allergic to shrimp, any kind of seafood. So, Im saying, I try to build my little grocery thing around whatever yall need now come and ask me.Audra, Garrian, and Joshua were 11, 17, and 15 at the time the interview was conducted, and Lottie took comfort in that they all good, they in good health.When 41-year-old Shalonda decided to care for her newborn granddaughter, Dana, it was because of the home conditions of Danas parents. In addition to their home being unclean and having rodents, Shalonda was dismayed that Danas parents werent adequately feeding her. Shalonda described how the culmination of these circumstances compelled her to become her granddaughters legal guardian:I got attached to her [Dana] ... I would literally go [to her parents home] and make sure she ate I was gonna make sure she ate. I didnt take her home without feeding her. If she went home! I even was paying bills over there to make sure they had a phone so I could check on her.Eventually, Danas mother began to leave the infant in Shalondas care for extended periods of time: So, I just kinda took her and then when the daycare was up and I couldnt take her I just called up here at child parent neglect. When I interviewed her, Shalonda had been raising Dana for 7 years.Faith, 48, described her granddaughter Schuylers state when she called DCFS upon learning the child had a black eye:When they [DCFS] took her out, she was muddyand when I say muddy, she was dripping with pee-pee and dirt. No shoes on. Pamper was sagging like she had the Pamper on for about three days. And her hair was all over her head She was screaming and hollering too. They jumped in the car and took her straight to the hospital She was unnourished, teeth was rotten; teeth still is rotten across the top.After leaving the hospital, Schuyler spent 7 months in a non-relative foster home. When Faith became Schuylers foster parent, she prioritized nurturing her back to health: Yeah, my daughter say when they [parents] was staying with her that the girl went and bought about 13 gallons of that juice. No milk. No food.They also fed the toddler fast food. Faith made sure that 3-year-old Schuyler ate real food, regardless of whether she felt like cooking: Sometimes I dont feel like putting anything in my mouth, but I still make a meal for her because I have to make sure that she eats regardless if I want to eat or not I dont feel like it, but I do cook. Faith was also addressing Schuylers rotten teeth: I took her to the dentist, but she need some kind of caps for rotten teeth.Grandmothers also instituted unfamiliar daily regimens, creating conflict with grandchildren and testing their own patience. May, 58, described what it was like introducing her granddaughter to healthy foods:I cook, but she be wanting that frozen dinner mess because she so used to having frozen dinners. And like she like oodles and noodles and Vienna sausages, peanut butter and jelly, and bologna. My kids didnt even eat that mess. I got up and I cooked seven-course meals. She getting into it, but sometimes she tell me, I dont eat that. I said look, I dont run no restaurant. [Laughs.] You dont wanna eat that, you just aint gonna eat.Despite her own poor health, May wanted to make sure that her granddaughter was well nourished and accustomed to real food. So, she cooked for her every day. She also let her tantrum while insisting on healthy foods. Although McKayla was 7, May maintained that last year she couldve got on the bus and passed as a 4-year-old. Thats how small she was. McKayla was still wearing sizes 4 or 5T [toddlers].Grandmothers cooked for their grandchildren, whether they felt like it or not, and often despite their own poor health, to nurture their grandchildren back to health. They catered to their dietary cravings, but also bore the brunt of childrens anger in the absence of the junk food they may have been accustomed to.Managing Prenatal Substance ExposureTwenty-one parents in my study were grappling with substance addiction and two more were in recovery and rehabilitation. What this meant for some of the grandmothers that I interviewed was that they 1) needed to rescue their grandchildren from being taken into state custody (mostly as kinship foster care providers or through kinship diversion); and 2) had to manage the impact of prenatal substance exposure on childrens health, which ranged from no impact to lifelong developmental disabilities.Helens experience typified what happened when grandmothers stepped in to raise a grandchild because of prenatal substance exposure, which didnt negatively impact the childs health. When her newborn grandson Ebere was born with prenatal substance exposure, Helen, 48, assumed primary responsibility for him through kinship diversion. According to Helen, Eberes mother Sonya struggled with an untreated mental illness. Moreover, when she gave birth to Ebere, she couldnt be left alone with him because someone had put something in her weed causing her to trip off.What was that like? I did not believe what I was doing. Hell, this aint my child!Given her state, Helen didnt expect much help from Sonya with respect to raising Ebere, but she did expect her 27-year-old son Nicholasthe boys fatherwho was living with her at the time, to help her care for the baby. But when she asked Nicholas to take him to the clinic or get the WIC (Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition), he would tell her things like I aint got time for that.So, she became responsible for ensuring that Ebere got to his doctors appointments and got the resources he needed, including applying for a medical card. Helen only had to take him to the doctor if he was sick ... If he got sick with a cold or anything Id take him. When I asked what it was like when she first got her newborn grandson she shared:Oh, let me see what was that like? I did not believe what I was doing. Hell, this aint my child! [Laughs.] Shit. I was like this is not my child . Ill tell you its a trip. I am angry somewhat because its stopped my life It was hell and back. (Chuckles.) Hell and back. This was a newborn child. Im not young no more. I could still deal with it if I choose to deal with it, but this is forced on me to deal with.Ebere was attached to his grandmother to the point that he rarely left her side apart from her working and him attending daycare. Helen described him as real smart. Theres nothing he cant catch on. She acknowledged that while some children born with prenatal substance exposure got some issues, I guess it didnt affect him like that. At the time of the interview, Ebere had been in her care for 5 years and was just beginning to sleep in the bed shed bought him. Nicholas lack of involvement worsened when he began to use the crack he was selling. Helens need to navigate childrearing institutions without having to track him down led her to obtain guardianship of her grandson.Fifty-one-year-old Tamara was raising four of her grandchildren (ages 18, 17, 10, and 8) as a kinship adoptive parent. Ladonna, one of Tamaras four children, lost her children to state custody because of her substance addiction. When Tamara first stepped in, the oldest three children stayed in the system about seven months. I never missed a visit. I never missed a court date. I love my grandkids and thats the only way I could see em they dont give us no visits.The DCFS caseworker helped Tamara become the childrens unlicensed kinship foster care provider. Soon after Tamara assumed responsibility for her three grandchildren, Ladonna had another baby: The hospital called, I go pick him up. And after then she went crazy. Every nine months she was having a baby. Ladonna had 13 children, and Tamara and her partner of 12 years couldnt take them all, a decision she still struggled with.I couldnt deal with all those kids. And she got one, two, three she got three handicapped kids. And I couldnt do that. You know that take a lot of time. My hip messed up now I prayed to God. I said, God, dont feel like this is something that I didnt wanna do. I just cant do it. A family member took three of the children and the rest were placed in non-relative foster care. Tamara shared her experience of dealing with DCFS as she cared for her grandchildren with prenatal substance exposure:You got drug-ridden children. You know cause I got em. You know they hyper. You constantly got to run, run, run, get this medicine for them. You got to sit up in these meetings. You got to pay out your pocket to get there. They dont come bring you no bus card. You got to do that yourself. And if you care anything about this child, youre gonna get em there. You know because its bad when you see your child or your grandbaby, if you care anything about em, just laying in there rockin and cryin, just rockin and cryin. She continued, And theyre busting out in sweat and stuff and youre praying to God, what can I do for this child? When theyre having withdrawals. You know? I done been there. I got two of em in the back. And they were, I just look at em, some growin out of them now but I feel like itll be there for the rest of their lives. They dont know. They just bring those kids to us, and they drop em off and do a lot of paperwork and come back the next month and look and see if theyre ok. If the house is clean. Everythings A-okay. Its not A-okay. Its not.Tamara divulged that years later, she could still see the impact of prenatal substance exposure on two of her grandchildren. Since caring for them, she had gotten her grandchildren the care they needed by explaining her status as a grandmother and by demonstrating her legal authority (e.g., DCFS documentation and the childrens medical cards): I have no problem. Even when I say, Im their grandmother. Because basically the hospitals and the schools they know whats going on with these six kids [her 4 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren] so At the time of the interview, Tamara had been her grandchildrens adoptive parent for 8 years.Eighty-one-year-old Louise became the licensed foster parent and later the adoptive parent of three of her grandchildren when their mother Melissa refused to take training courses to help her care for her premature, substance-exposed baby. Fearing that she might get into trouble, Melissa left Cole at the hospital and the doctors contacted DCFS. When DCFS investigated, they removed Cole and his two older siblings from Melissas care because of her substance addiction. Because Clinton, the childrens father and Louises son, was in prison, it was up to Louise to undergo training to care for Cole.She said, His mother left him at the hospital. He didnt weigh 2 pounds. He was tiny, tiny, tiny. ... when I got him, he was 8 months old ... And he was hooked up to everything, too. He had a heart monitor, he had oxygen ... he just had everything. I had to take the training for his inhalation therapy and everything to work with him.Louise remembered being contacted by a caseworker and going down to Michael Reese Hospital where the caseworker puts them two [12-year-old Sophia and 10-year-old Clinton Jr.] in my hands. She gave her some little medical cards for them so that she could take them to the dentist and doctor. In addition to carrying around Coles heavy iron oxygen tank, Louise had to carry him in a special-needs stroller, which was heavier and more cumbersome than a traditional stroller. As a single grandmother caring for her three grandchildren in the wake of the recent death of her husband of more than 40 years, Louise remarked of those early days, It was rough.At the time of the interview, Louise was still undergoing training to care for her 14-year-old grandson, who had been enrolled in Special Education classes his entire school tenure. These courses, facilitated by the DCFS and Illinois State Board of Education, were designed to assist caregivers in attending to developmental disorders and navigating the Special Education system.Helens, Tamaras, and Louises stories show the ways in which prenatal substance exposure required grandmothers to care for grandchildren with child welfare system involvement. Consistent with other research, the children in this study being cared for in the formal kinship care system were more likely to have experienced more severe child maltreatment than children being cared for by grandmothers who provide informal kinship care (Pittman, 2023).ConclusionWhen thrust into the primary caregiving role, grandmothers expected that meeting their grandchildrens needs would be challenging given their age, poor health, limited resources, and, for many, their struggle to accept the idea that they were raising a child all over again. Still, they revived old childrearing strategies and devised new ones to respond to their grandchildrens physical needs. They sought healthcare for grandchildren with illnesses and injuries in much the same way they had for their own children, but they also devised strategies to overcome their lack of legal authority or provided proof of legal authority so that their grandchildren could get the medical treatment they needed.Importantly, the grandmothers in my study had limited (if any) access to nonpunitive institutions (the police and CPS) to obtain the legal rights they needed to provide adequate care. Their stories demonstrate the legal complications grandparents faced as they tended to their grandchildrens physical needs. Still, grandmothers took pride in fattening up malnourished children and exercised patience as they acclimated their grandchildren to healthier foods.Grandmothers caring for children with prenatal substance exposure managed kinship foster care or kinship diversion and took on the caregiving arrangements required by the state.Also emerging from my data was a picture of the way in which the unanticipated demands of care work could prove to be too much not only for grandmothers individual resources, but also for those in their familial and extended kinships networks. Thus, grandmothers used institution-based networks to get their grandchildren assessed and treated, seeking institutional assistance for their grandchildren based on their ability to meet eligibility criteria, convenience, and familiarity.LaShawnDa Pittman, PhD, is an associate professor of American Ethnic Studies and the Joff Hanauer Honors Professor of Western Civilization at the University of Washington in Seattle.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Gendis ImagesReferencesIllinois Department of Human Services. n.d.EarnFare.https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx/?item=31772Pittman, L.

Latino cultural values and beliefs such asfamilismo,machismo, andmarianismocan influence how Latina grandmother caregivers view themselves and their roles. Strengths from these beliefs and values should be considered when supporting Latina grandmother caregivers and their families.Key WordsLatina grandmothers, grandparents raising grandchildren, cultural impact, Latino cultureTwo things are well-known: Latinos are the second largest U.S. ethnic group (behind White Americans; (Funk & Lopez, 2022) and the prevalence of grandparents raising grandchildren in this population continues to grow (Guastaferro et al., 2023). Findings from the American Community Survey found that in 2019, 1 out of 7 children lived with a grandparent and 1.6% of all Latino children lived in homes with a grandparent and no parents (Chen & Guzman, 2022).The majority of grandparent caregiver research has focused on U.S. majority populations. This is not to say researchers havent tried to involve more minority groups, such as those from diverse ethnic, educational, or religious backgrounds; those living in rural areas; or informal caregivers who are not currently using support services. Effectively integrating these and other populations into research is a challenge researchers constantly face and seek to mitigate. Of particular relevance to the present article is the fact that there has been little analysis of the specific difficulties faced when recruiting grandparent caregivers of Latino descent to participate in studies and when convincing them to use vital services.In addition to these recruitment struggles, it is important to consider the impact of cultural values such asfamilismo,marianismo, and machismo when trying to understand and support Latina grandmothers. I would argue that these beliefs, in their original sense, are beautiful strengths of the Latino culture.Unfortunately, during the process of adapting to the dominant culture in the United States, living in accordance with traditional cultural values and beliefs often is viewed as having negative consequences. Evidence suggests this is especially true for Latinos who have experienced greater assimilation to American ideals of self-actualization as opposed to those who maintain familismo, a family-first focus (Cahill et al., 2021; Falzarano et al., 2022; Funk & Lopez, 2022; Sabogal et al., 1987).This assimilation comes at a cost for families and individuals, with several studies finding an increase in depression and anxiety symptoms in those who do not embrace familismo (Cahill et al., 2021; Falzarano et al., 2022; Sabogal et al., 1987; Steidel & Contreras, 2003). Findings such as these demonstrate the need to increase our understanding of the complex multigenerational issues Latina grandmother caregivers face, as well as their internal struggles.Familismo, Machismo, and MarianismoFamilismo is recognized as a core value of the Latino culture. It is described as a strong interdependence, attachment, identification, and commitment to ones family, with family needs superseding those of a single individual (Steidel & Contreras, 2003). This value in Latino culture is guided by the gender-prescribed roles machismo and marianismo.Machismo is a set of beliefs, values, and attitudes regarding the role of men. These include positive and negative aspects such as honor, aggression, bravery, sexism, and reserved emotions. Machismo describes a man as being responsible for providing, protecting, and defending his family. Currently, there is a growing body of literature featuring a more positive image of the male gender known ascaballerismo, which includes attributes such as bravery, providing for family, pride, honor, and treating women with respect and dignity (Nuez et al., 2016).In accordance with the values offamilismoandmarianismo, Latina women are introduced to the role of caregiving at a young age.The termmarianismohas many definitions and is often viewed negatively as the female counterpart of machismo. It is a set of attributes of the ideal Latina woman. Specific attributes can vary, but overall the idea is that the woman is the anchor of the family. She should be strong, keep her family united, be selfless, sacrifice her own needs for those of the family, take care of others, and help family members with their problems, all without divulging family issues to anyone outside of the family (K. D. Castillo et al., 2012; Da Silva et al., 2021).According to L.G. Castillo et al. (2010, 2021), there are five pillars of marianismo: 1) family pillar (main source of strength for the family); 2) virtuous and chaste (morally pure in thought and sexuality); 3)respeto(respect; show obedience and respect for the Latino hierarchical power structure); 4) self-silencing (should not share personal thoughts or needs to maintain harmony in relationships); and 5) spiritual pillar (spiritual leaders of the family).In accordance with the values of familismo and marianismo, Latina women are introduced to the role of caregiving at a young age. They watch the women around them care for others and are responsible for helping to take care of younger siblings and/or grandparents (Escandn, 2006). This caregiving role becomes part of their identity and is viewed as a virtue. Escandns (2006) study with Latina caregivers of older adults provided some examples of the importance of caregiving among Latina women: I saw caregiving ... since I was a small child, my aunt ... saw her caregiving to other people, relatives .... My mother was a caregiver for my aunt ... . I saw that ... all the time (p. 573). Also:I see myself really dedicated to family ... I just feel ... I will always be there for my parents, thats the way I was raised ... my grandmothers ... were [cared for] by the family ... . I just feel that theres a real strong tie when it comes to family relationships. (p. 574)Im a Grandparent; Why Would I Need Help?When I have interviewed Latina grandmothers, one of the main themes that emerged was that most of these grandmothers did not identify themselves as grandparents raising grandchildren. Instead, they viewed themselves as helpers who were filling their familial obligation (Mendoza & Weil, 2014). Calidad, a Cuban grandmother explained it by saying:La familia en Cuba no se separan como aqui. Eso es normal-que los abuelitos cuiden a los neitos. (Families in Cuba dont separate like they do here. That is normalfor grandparents to care for their grandchildren.)Another grandmother, Maria, held full responsibility for her granddaughter and two step grandchildren. When I asked her whether she was aware of services available for grandparents raising grandchildren, she gave me a confused look and responded, No, but I dont think I qualify because I am not raising my grandchildren.Anna, a grandmother raising three grandchildren, explained how her entire life had entailed caregivingfirst for her siblings, then her children and parents, and now her grandchildren. She said, This is what I know, this is my part (role) in my family.The consensus among the Latina grandmothers was that unlike those grandparents who were using support services, they were not raising their grandchildren.Overall, the consensus among the Latina grandmothers was that, unlike those grandparents who were using support services, they were not raising their grandchildren. They were doing what grandparents dofulfilling their role as a grandparent by caring for their grandchildren. These grandmothers responses coincide with the marianismo attributes discussed earlier.This brings up a key issue: If Latina grandmothers feel obligated to care for their grandchildren, is there a point at which they would begin to acknowledge the difficulties they are having in fulfilling this obligation? Is there a point where they would say, Yes, I am actually raising my grandchildren, not just helping? What would the implications of such a change of perspective have on their well-being?When Does it Become Too Much?Grandmothers across the globe take care of their grandchildren. In the grandfamilies literature, a grandparent is raising a grandchild when they are the primary caregiver to that child. This definition may be sufficient in a culture where women are not expected to provide care for their grandchildren, but this definition is not culturally appropriate for the Latino culture. As previously mentioned, Latina grandmothers are expected to be involved in the raising of their grandchildren.Depending upon their adult childs life situation, the grandmothers care may range from caring for a child for a few hours a week to having full responsibility for them. So, the question becomes, when does it go from providing childcare to raising a grandchild? Do we base it on hours/days/weeks or on the types of responsibilities (e.g., school, homework help, doctor appointments)?Evidence suggests that providing childcare for a grandchild can have positive outcomes for the grandparent, but those positive outcomes may be outweighed by negative outcomes when a grandparent is the primary caregiver (Goodman et al., 2013; Hayslip Jr. & Kaminski, 2005; Lee et al., 2015). It is unclear when caring for their grandchildren becomes too much for a grandparent.For Latina grandmothers, this situation is further complicated. If they view themselves as helpers, do they experience the same positive outcomes of childcare and the same negative outcomes of having full responsibility of a grandchild? How do the values of marianismo impact a Latina grandmothers well-being in this role?I am reminded of Calidad, who moved from Cuba to the United States to raise her grandson while her daughter worked more than 80 hours per week. During our interview she reflected, Estoy aqui por mi hija, pero aveses miro y me pregunto, porque si ella escojio este camino, porque, yo tenia que seguirla?pero bueno. (I am here for my daughter, but at times I think and ask myself, why, if she chose this path, why did I have to follow her?but oh well.)When asked if she had regrets, Calidad responded:No es que me arrepento, por el nino no me puedo arrepentir. (No, its not that I have regrets. I cant have regrets because of the boy.)In some cases, the commitment and impact it has on her personal life has felt like too much. As another grandmother, Juliana, said:I want to take care of Ani (her granddaughter), but I want to be able to have the freedom to go anywhere I want, take computer classes, schedule doctor appointments, and do my own things. But I cant tell my daughter that. I cant allow someone who isnt family to take care of my granddaughter.These quotes from Calidad and Juliana demonstrate how the Latino culture has impacted their experiences as Latina grandmother caregivers. They both put aside their own feelings and desires to care for their grandchildren.How Do We Help?The first step to supporting these Latina grandmothers is accepting that there is so much we do not yet understand. We must recognize that if we want to support them, we need more research specific to Latina grandmothers, in which their voices take center stage. In the meantime, practitioners and researchers need to take the Latino culture into consideration when delivering interventions and support services to Latina grandmothers.For example, if Latina grandmother caregivers view themselves as helpers, not as grandparents raising grandchildren, they are not likely to seek or use services advertised for grandparents raising grandchildren. This view of themselves in combination with the belief that one should keep family issues within the family, can be a barrier to service usage. To overcome this challenge and others like it, we must pay attention to the strengths of the cultural values such as marianismo and approach these grandmothers with respect for how they see themselves.As I mentioned earlier, marianismo is often viewed in a negative light. This may be a result of research focusing more on the negative outcomes related to a Latina womans identity, but there are numerous positive attributes of an ideal Latina woman. In the example above, where a grandmother sees herself as a helper, her dedication to support and protect her family can be beneficial in encouraging her to accept/seek supportive services not for her own benefit, but for that of her family (e.g., daughter, granddaughter).Interventions that highlight this role, of being the family pillar, can be beneficial in supporting both the Latina grandmother and her family.As the pillars of the family, Latinas are respected, admired, serve as role models, and are responsible for the health and unity of the family. Interventions that highlight this role of being the family pillar can be beneficial in supporting both the Latina grandmother and her family. In my own intervention research, I focus on building resilience. One of the ways we do this is through self-care. We help caregivers understand the importance of taking care of themselves. I will often tell grandmothers, Taking care of yourself is taking care of your grandchildren. In taking care of themselves, Latina grandmother caregivers are role modeling for their grandchildren (and children), ensuring they can offer the best version of themselves to their grandchildren, and in the process improve the lives of their families. As these suggestions demonstrate, there is so much more that needs to be understood before we can say with confidence that we are supporting Latina grandmothers.Moving ForwardWe need more research on the impact of the Latino culture and acculturation on the experiences and perspectives of Latina grandmother caregivers. I understand this is a complicated task, as there are many layers and complexities to consider. Latino culture encompasses numerous countries, different acculturation levels, and is constantly evolving. Yet, if we are to support Latina grandmother helpers we need to not only learn about their personal experiences and perspectives but also about the culture around them and how it is changing.The idea of marianismo may fit the experiences of some grandmothers, but it has changed drastically over the years as women have become more independent, educated, and self-advocating. A womens place in the Latino culture is changing, as evidenced in 2024 when Mexico elected the first woman president in North America, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, and by the many women who have been presidents throughout Central America, such as Laura Chinchilla Miranda in Costa Rica and Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner in Argentina.I have witnessed some of these changes in my own experience and observations. For me, an ideal Latina woman is strong, caring (of herself and those around her), the pillar of the family, intelligent, creative, determined, a mama bear, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants (whether for herself or for her children). Here I think of the many women I know who have worked hard and made sacrifices to reach and maintain their career goals. I also think of my grandmother, who found a way to cross the border with no money and five small children.The changes in perceptions of Latina women are evident and raise the question of whether marianismo is still relevant, or if its relevancy is based on age, class, or geographical location. Yet, it is clear that grandmothers, mothers, sisters, and daughters must be willing to ask their partners and other family members for help, something that remains difficult if not impossible for most Latina women to do.Yes, I am one of those. I will admit it; I struggle to ask for help. I used to think it was because I am strong and can do anything! Well, I am strong, but I also need to remind myself that being strong does not mean you dont ask for help; in fact, it takes a lot of strength and courage to recognize you could use the help, to ask for help, and then to accept it. In reflecting now, I remember my grandmother was the same way, my mother is the same way, and so is my daughter.This subject is both timely and relevant to current social work practice because of the increase in Latinos in the United States, the increase in grandmothers raising grandchildren, and steady immigration to the United States from Latino countries, which often result in children staying behind with their grandparents. The combination of these circumstances results in the need for culturally appropriate supports and interventions for Latina grandmother caregivers which, because of their role in their family, will result in benefits for the entire family.In understanding how culture influences the experiences of Latina grandmothers, researchers and practitioners must be better equipped to understand their perspectives, tailor support services accordingly, and provide culturally appropriate interventions that employ cultural values in a strengths-based manner. The impact of current changes in values and perspectives on the experiences of Latina grandmothers requires further research to understand how interventions and supports can help their male relatives better support them in their caregiver role. There is evidence that these values can have implications for Latinos mental and physical well-being, yet there is much to learn about how these cultural values, as well as adaptations to the dominant culture, impact the well-being of Latina grandmothers caring for grandchildren.Nancy Mendoza, PhD, is an assistant professor at Ohio State Universitys College of Social Work in Columbus, Ohio.

Day, John Fowler, Cheryl Miller, and Geene DelaplaneFebruary 05, 2025TagsEquity & JusticeInnovation & Social ImpactAbstractThis article describes Washington States efforts to understand and support the needs of kinship caregivers through cultural adaptations, focusing on tribal and Latine communities. The states Kinship Navigator Program history is described, as well as its statewide Pro-Active Equity Anti-Racism framework. Caregivers may be directed to local services, which can include: financial resources, emergency assistance funds, support groups, basic needs & clothing, summer respite resources, school/youth activities, and legal/custody resourcesKey Wordskinship caregivers, Kinship Navigator Program, tribal communities, Latine communities, Area Agency on Aging, Pro-Active Equity Anti-RacismIn recent years, Washington State has taken significant steps to understand and support the needs of kinship caregivers through cultural adaptations, particularly for people from Latine and tribal communities. Starting with a history of the Kinship Navigator Program in Washington State, we will look at what it means to use a statewide, Pro-Active Equity Anti-Racism framework. By examining different data sources, including the Healthy Youth Survey, we can delve into practical service-level and cultural adaptations that will be helpful for tribal and Latine communities.The Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) places children with kinship caregivers 54% of the time (DCYF, 2023). The vast majority of kinship caregivers care for children without the involvement of the child welfare authority, also known as informal kinship care (as opposed to formal care arranged by the child welfare authority). Nationally, just 133,873 children are placed in formal relative foster care placements, representing less than 5% of all kinship children (Childrens Bureau, 2022).In Washington State, more than 40,000 young people currently live with a grandparent rather than a parent (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2021). Grandparents and other kinship caregivers in Washington State frequently have lower income levels and rely upon fixed incomes, leading them to struggle to financially support the youth in their care (Day et al., 2020).All kinship care providers are eligible for some public supports, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family (TANF) Child-Only Grant, which provides government funds for children in kinship care, and the Kinship Caregivers Support Program (KCSP), available only to informal kinship care families, which provides state funding for basic needs on a short-term basis. Day et al. (2020) pointed out that these financial supports are often less than those provided in Washington State to foster parents. Many kinship care providers also are not aware of these supports or struggle to access available resources.Washington State Kinship Navigator ProgramSince 2005, kinship navigators have supported formal and informal kinship caregivers, starting with two pilot sites and now serving every county through the state-funded program. Kinship navigator projects were designed to help kinship families navigate the service system by offering information and referral, advocacy, and support. Kinship navigators are experts who help kinship caregivers by providing information and support. Kinship navigators can connect caregivers with valuable services in the community. They serve all counties in the state, while seven tribes participate with tribal navigators serving their respective tribes.ALTSA partners with the 13 local AAAs to provide kinship navigator services.Each of the kinship navigator programs serve the catchment area of their Area Agency on Aging (AAA), giving kinship navigators and their tribal counterparts a community understanding because they are members of these communities. The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration (ALTSA) works intentionally to help build trust between these communities and local and state government by connecting with local services providers who live in the community. This way, families may feel safer engaging in services and using resources. Caregivers may be directed to local services, which can include:Financial ResourcesEmergency Assistance FundsSupport GroupsBasic Needs & ClothingSummer Respite Resources School/Youth ActivitiesLegal/Custody ResourcesWashington States Kinship Navigator Program is run by staff at ALTSA. The ALTSA kinship team consists of the kinship and lifespan respite program manager and a fidelity analyst. ALTSA partners with the 13 local AAAs to provide kinship navigator services. Some of the AAAs choose to keep those services in house, and some subcontract with local service organizations to provide kinship services. While the ALTSA team oversees the program, each individual program is responsible for hiring and supervising their kinship navigator employees and their day-to-day operations. Some of the AAAs and/or their subcontractors recognized the need to hire Spanish-speaking bilingual staff to serve monolingual Spanish-speaking caregivers in their communities.Pro-Active Equity Anti-RacismOn March 21, 2022, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee established the Pro-Active Equity Anti-Racism (PEAR) framework to address the exclusion, marginalization, and oppression of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) with low income, immigrants and refugees, people living with disabilities, and other groups. Such injustices have resulted in deeply entrenched educational, economic, and health inequities. It is within this PEAR framework that both DCYF and ALTSA support kinship caregivers. The PEAR framework is built on five core strategies:Implementing the PEAR Framework: Agencies work in partnership with communities and organizations to address implicit and explicit biases and all levels of racism, focusing particularly on the experiences of BIPOC.Embracing Continuous Improvement: Agencies are encouraged to build capacity for continuous learning and improvement, ensuring that policies and practices evolve to sustain equitable outcomes.Assessing Equity Impact: Agencies are required to understand and evaluate the impact of their policies and actions on equity, using this understanding to guide decision-making and policy adjustments.Making Data-Informed Investments: Agencies should identify root causes of disparities and prioritize investments that address these gaps, benefiting those who traditionally have been excluded.Ensuring Transparency and Accountability: Agencies must maintain a long-term commitment to equity, using data-driven decision-making and tracking outcomes to build public trust and accountability.ThePEAR Plan & Playbookoutlines tools and strategies for creating a PEAR ecosystem in Washington State, ensuring all residents have access to the opportunities and resources needed to thrive. Informed by data including the Healthy Youth Survey, the PEAR framework also determines trends, including those within BIPOC communities, to help inform the work we do.Healthy Youth SurveyThe Healthy Youth Survey (HYS) is a biennial survey that has been conducted in Washington State since 2002. It assesses various risk behaviors among 6th to 12th graders, including substance use, injury-related behaviors including carrying a weapon, food and physical activity habits, mental health, school climate, and protective factors. The survey provides crucial insights into adolescent health and well-being.Key stakeholders, such as state, local, and tribal public health agencies, county prevention coordinators, and community coalitions, use HYS data to inform policies and programs that benefit youth. Approximately 7 years ago, ALTSA collaborated with HYS to include a survey question about living situations. This allows stakeholders to analyze risk behaviors among youth in kinship care and foster homes.Because we have data-driven insight, we recognize that young people of color are more likely to experience multiple out-of-home placements, less likely to be reunited with their birth families, and more likely to experience congregate care. Prioritizing kinship care for young people of color is important for establishing permanency, reducing entrance into foster care, and ensuring that cultural and community ties are maintained (DCYF, 2020).Tribal CommunitiesIndigenous grandparents are overrepresented in kinship caregiving systems; they are 3 times more likely to be kinship caregivers than the general population (Day et al., 2024).Day et al. (2024) reported that Indigenous kinship caregivers feel judged by social workers who do not know their history, such as the traumatic impact of American Indian boarding schools and the resulting trauma they have created. Such historical trauma can cause many Indigenous families to distrust mainstream, non-tribal services offered to American Indian grandparents (Day et al., 2024). The tribal Kinship Navigator Program provides opportunities to reinforce a childs sense of cultural identity and self-esteem through continued family connection.The Office of Indian Policy works statewide to help solve the collective needs of tribal governments and Recognized American Indian Organizations to assure quality and comprehensive program service delivery from the DSHS to all American Indians and Alaska Natives in Washington state. The ALTSA Tribal Affairs unit is committed to partnering with tribes in Washington to achieve mutual goals between sovereign governments.Latine kinship caregivers face distinct obstacles, including language barriers, lower incomes, and higher incidences of unmet medical needs for children in their care.Delivering comprehensive, culturally appropriate services can be achieved by developing partnerships with tribes and Recognized American Indian Organizations, existing Long-Term Services and Support partners, and providers such as state and local government and private contractors. They provide cultural outreach to Tribal members to ensure that trusted members of the community deliver information.The ALTSA Tribal Affairs unit also coordinates the biannual Money Follows the Person Tribal Summit. In Washington, the Money Follows the Person program, known as Roads to Community Living, has always been an inclusive service providing pathways to home for anyone who was living in a facility. The Initiative focuses on developing inclusive service contracts and engaging potential partners at the state, tribal, and county levels for improved and culturally inclusive service delivery of ALTSA services, including tribal contracted support services.Tribal Kinship Navigator ProgramThe Tribal Kinship Navigator Program was funded in 2016 through the Washington State legislature. The program serves grandparents and other relatives (kinship caregivers) who are raising children because their parents are unable to do so. The DSHS Aging and Long-Term Support Administration is committed to partnering with tribes in Washington to achieve mutual goals between sovereign governments. Funding is available for seven of Washington States 39 federally recognized tribes to run a kinship navigator program. Currently, seven Tribes are partnering with ALTSA to run the tribal Kinship Navigator Program in their communities to meet the specific needs of their tribal kinship caregivers in a culturally mindful manner.Tribal Kinship Navigators serve as a one-stop shop, providing resources, assistance, problem-solving, and emotional support to kinship caregivers who are overwhelmed and do not know where to turn for support. Caregivers often need help to apply for benefits and to learn what services are available related to financial needs, healthcare, educational advocacy, counseling, legal help, and other needs. They also act as advocates and assist these families with resources for housing, support groups, urgent need funds, and continuing connections with their tribal community.Through the Tribal Kinship Navigator Program in 20222024, 612 kinship caregivers and 808 children received 3,143 tribal navigator assistance contacts.Currently seven tribes have Kinship Navigators Programs:Confederated Tribes of the Colville ReservationLummi TribeMakah TribePort Gamble SKlallam TribeQuileute TribeSamish TribeYakama NationStarting in 2020, the Port Gamble SKlallam Tribe worked with evaluation researchers from the University of Washington School of Social Work to develop and implement a tribally adapted needs assessment to use with kinship families. All caregivers who participated in a focus group and survey reported that their kinship navigator helped them obtain extracurricular activities/summer programs (Day, 2022). Additionally, 75% reported obtaining support with financial assistance, school-related support for their kinship child, and respite. Overall caregivers had a positive perception of their kinship navigators and the various services they accessed through the program, and they expressed high satisfaction (Day, 2022). ALTSA staff connect regularly with tribal kinship navigators at quarterly statewide meetings, new staff onboarding, and yearly at the Washington Tribal summit.Latine CommunitiesStatewide Survey and Its ImplicationsTo gain a deeper insight into the challenges faced by kinship caregivers, Washington State conducted a statewide survey from 20192021, using a sample of 736 kinship caregivers (Gmez et al., 2024). Most of these kinship caregivers identified as women (89.8%). The mean age of the sample population of kinship caregivers was 58.9. Based on self-reporting for ethnicity (n = 60) Latine kinship caregivers and (n = 676) non-Latine kinship caregivers participated in this mixed-method exploratory survey. This initiative aimed to capture the experiences and needs of caregivers, providing a robust data set to inform policy and program development. The survey revealed critical areas where support was most needed, particularly for Latine caregivers who reported unique challenges compared to their non-Latine counterparts.Kinship Navigator ProgramsA cornerstone of Washington States support system for kinship caregivers is the Kinship Navigator Programs. These programs are designed to help caregivers access necessary services and navigate the complexities of legal and mental health issues. For many caregivers, these programs offer invaluable assistance in managing the multifaceted demands of their roles. However, despite these efforts, economic hardships and immigration-related challenges continue to pose significant barriers.Addressing the Needs of Latine CaregiversLatine kinship caregivers face distinct obstacles, including language barriers, lower incomes, and higher incidences of unmet medical needs for children in their care. Washington States survey highlighted these disparities, underscoring the need for more targeted support. While Kinship Navigator Programs provide crucial aid, there is a recognized need for more Spanish-speaking providers and services tailored to the specific circumstances of Latine families.Economic and Social SupportThe states support framework includes various forms of economic and social assistance. These measures are vital in alleviating some of the financial pressures faced by kinship caregivers. However, the survey also identified ongoing challenges, such as access to medical care and the need for consistent and adequate financial assistance.Recommendations for Enhanced SupportBased on the survey findings, several recommendations have been proposed to enhance support for kinship caregivers in Washington State:Increase Spanish-Speaking Providers: Expanding the availability of Spanish-speaking health and service providers to meet the needs of Latine caregivers.Enhance Financial and Social Support: Providing more robust financial assistance and social support to alleviate the economic burdens faced by many caregivers.Sustainable Kinship Navigator Models: Developing sustainable models for Kinship Navigator Programs that effectively address the specific needs of Latine families.Address Systemic Issues: Focusing on systemic issues such as documentation challenges and employment opportunities can further support kinship caregivers in their roles.Current Cultural AdaptationBased on this survey of Latine kinship caregiver families conducted by Dr. Angelique Days research team from the University of Washington, its findings, as well as what kinship navigators have found in the field have shaped their approach to working with kinship families. Hiring Spanish-speaking kinship navigators has been a critical step to supporting monolingual Latine kinship caregivers families. Nonnative Spanish speakers continue to take classes to keep up and learn new skills. Navigators translate paperwork into various languages to make information accessible.Kinship navigators participate in outreach, specifically targeting Latine kinship caregivers including radio and community events in the Latine community. The Legal Advice and Referral for Kinship Care (LAARK) program offers legal advice in different languages; it also can offer support or referrals to other organizations to help kinship care families deal with legal issues, including concerns about immigration status for caregivers, or the children for whom they care.ConclusionWashington States commitment to understanding and supporting kinship caregivers, especially in the Latine and tribal communities, is evident through its comprehensive survey and targeted programs. While significant progress has been made, ongoing efforts and tailored interventions are necessary to fully meet the diverse needs of kinship caregivers across the state. Through continued focus on these areas, Washington State aims to provide a robust support system that can adapt and respond to the cultural needs of kinship families.

AcciusFebruary 05, 2025TagsEquity & JusticeAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingBackground: Setting the StageAccording to the Oxford Dictionary, strength is the ability to withstand great force or pressure. When you turn on the news or talk to a family, friend, neighbor, or co-worker, it is evident that we all are living in a time of great volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, where we must summon our inner strength like never before. Strength can manifest in many formsphysical, emotional, mental, and spiritualand it shapes who we are as well as who we become.For me, I can trace my strength back to my grandmother, who raised me for the first 4 years of my life. My grandmother was one of what is now nearly 3 million grandparents raising grandchildren in America (AARP, 2018).As I reflect upon her unwavering courage and the sacrifices she made for me, I realize just how deeply her strength has impacted the man that I am and the man that I am becoming.This article is a tribute to her, a woman whodespite the challenges, roadblocks, and barriers life threw her wayresponded with a fierce combination of grit, perseverance, tenacity, sacrifice, and love to raise me and lay the foundation I needed to thrive. At age 101, she continues to teach me and model the power of strength, even with her ongoing battle with dementia.The Early Years: A Foundation of Love and SacrificeWhen I think back to my early childhood, the memory of my grandmother immediately comes to mind. A few months before I was born, my mother came to the hard realization that she was not in a position to raise me. After years of therapy, I have finally come to accept how hard such a decision was to make as a parent and how grateful I am that my grandmother was willing to care for me.My grandmother stood in the gaps and laid the necessary foundation for my well-being, stepping into a caregiver role she thought she had long left behind. Sometimes life doesnt give you a choice. It takes strength and tremendous courage to become a parent again after believing that chapter in life has passed. Yet, my grandmother embraced this role without hesitation, ensuring I had everything I neededfood, shelter, love, guidance, and support.She found ways to make do with what little we had, stretching every dollar to provide for me.Those early years with her shaped me in ways Im still discovering. I can recall my grandmother waking up well before the sun rose in Haiti, lifting up her basket of goods and placing it over her head, and heading off to the marketplace, leaving me in the care of other relatives and friends. In the evenings, Id see her return, exhausted after a long day but content knowing she was successful in providing her family with food.She sacrificed her own wants and needs to ensure that I was cared for and didnt go without lifes basic necessities. She showed meboth through her words and actionswhat true strength looks like. Its not just about physical power but the mental and emotional resilience required to care for another human being. It wasnt easy. Yet, like many grandparents, she did it.Lessons in StrengthAs I grew older and began raising my own children, I started to understand the magnitude of what my grandmother had done for me. Parenting is not for the faint of heart, and doing it a second time around, with the added responsibilities of life, requires a depth of strength and courage that I am only now beginning to grasp. As my grandmother got older and dementia became more apparent, I made it a priority to visit as often as I could. During my last visit with her, I held her hand, and she looked at me with the same determination I remembered from my early childhood and said, Be strong.Those two words, spoken so simply, held the weight of a lifetimes worth of experience. My grandmother had seen so much, lived through so many challenges, yet there she was, still guiding and teaching me, still reminding me to be strong. It was as if she was passing the torch, ensuring that her legacy of resilience would continue through me.The Legacy of GrandparentsMy grandmothers story is not unique. As this special edition of Generations highlights, the reasons so many grandparents raise their grandchildren varyunstable home life, parental addiction or substance use, incarceration, military deployment, physical or mental health issues, or death of a parent. Regardless of the reason, the research is clear: When children cannot remain in their parents care they do better in grandfamilies than in foster care (Generations United, 2023).Grandparents raising grandchildren are more likely to be people of color. Nationally, about a third of grandparents raising grandchildren are solely responsible for raising their children. About 18% of grandparents responsible for their grandchildren live in poverty. A quarter of those grandparents have disabilities. The percentage of grandparents raising grandchildren varies by state, with Southern states seeing a higher portion relative to the national average (See figure 3, below; Census Bureau, 2024).Grandparents, like my own, step into the role of primary caregiver out of necessity, love, and a deep sense of responsibility. But this role is not without its challenges. Caring for grandchildren often comes at a costemotionally, physically, and financially. Many grandparents, particularly those on fixed incomes, struggle to provide for their grandchildren while managing their own health and financial needs. Despite these challenges, they persevere, driven by the same strength, courage, and resilience that my grandmother displayed throughout her life.The Emotional, Physical and Spiritual TollIt is important to recognize the emotional and physical toll that caregiving can take on grandparents. The demands of raising a child can be overwhelming, especially when youre in the later stages of life.Grandparents raising grandchildren are more likely to experience stress in ensuring their grandchildren have all the resources and support needed to succeed, while at the same time navigating the complexities of systems and laws that often dont include nor support them. They also worry about what will happen to their grandchildren in the event they are no longer able to care for them. Yet, grandparents often push through these challenges to provide their grandchildren with a stable, nurturing environment.For my grandmother, there were days when I could see the exhaustion in her eyes, but she never let it stop her. She kept going, one day at a time, ensuring that I was well taken care of. This is a reality that many grandparents facebalancing the demands of caregiving with their own physical limitations and worries about the future. And yet, they continue to show up every day, doing what needs to be done, because thats what love looks like.The Financial ChallengesFinancially, raising a grandchild can be costly. According to Brookings Institution, the average cost of raising a child is $17,000 per year (Sawhill et al., 2022). Many grandparents live on fixed incomes, relying on Social Security, savings, or pensions to make ends meet. The additional costs of raising a childfood, clothing, education, medical expensescan quickly add up, leading to financial stress and greater economic insecurity. Despite these financial pressures, many grandparents often go without to ensure their grandchildren have what they need.Their strength is nothing short of extraordinary, and it deserves to be celebrated.My grandmother was no different. She found ways to make do with what little we had, stretching every dollar to provide for me. Her resourcefulness was nothing short of remarkable. She taught me the value of hard work, the importance of saving, and the necessity of making sacrifices for the ones you love. These lessons have stayed with me throughout my life and have shaped how I approach my financial responsibilities.The Strength of Community to Create Healthier CommunitiesMy grandmother taught me the Haitian Creole proverb, Tout moun, se moun, which means, every person is a human being. She understood the need for community and that no one can do it alone, and she sought out the support of friends, neighbors, and her church community. These relationships provided her with the emotional and practical support she needed to raise me. Whether it was a friend offering to babysit, a neighbor bringing over a meal, or a church member helping with chores, my grandmother accepted these acts of kindness with gratitude and humility.This sense of community is something that many grandparents rely upon as they navigate the challenges of raising their grandchildren. Support groups, social services, and community organizations play a crucial role in providing grandparents with the resources they need to care for their grandchildren. These networks of support are a testament to the power of collective strength and the importance of coming together to help one another in times of need.The Unseen HeroesGrandparents who step into the role of primary caregiver are often the unseen heroes of our society. They quietly go about their work, sometimes without recognition or praise, simply because its what needs to be done. They save the government and taxpayers more than $4 billion dollars annually (Generations United, 2020) because they stand in the gap, preventing their grandchildren from having to enter the children welfare system.Yet, they dont ask for accolades or attention; they do it out of love and a deep sense of duty. But their contributions should not go unnoticed. These grandparents are raising the next generation, providing them with the stability and love they need to thrive. They are instilling in their grandchildren the values of hard work, resilience, and compassion. And they are doing it all while managing their own health, financial, physical, and emotional challenges. Their strength is nothing short of extraordinary, and it deserves to be celebrated.A Personal ReflectionAs I reflect on my grandmothers life and the sacrifices she made for me, I am filled with a deep sense of gratitude. She has shaped who I am today, and her lessons of strength, resilience, and love continue to guide me as I raise my own children. Even now, as she battles dementia, her spirit remains strong. She may not remember all the details of her life, but the essence of who she isher strength, her love, her determinationremains.During my last visit with her, as she held my hands and told me to be strong, I realized that she was still teaching me. Her words were a reminder that no matter what challenges I face, I have the strength to overcome them. And that strength comes from a legacy of love and sacrifice that she has passed down to me.A Tribute to GrandparentsThis article is a tribute not just to my grandmother, but to all the grandparents who step into the role of caregiver for their grandchildren. Their strength, resilience, and love are a testament to the power of family. They are the unsung heroes who provide stability and care when its needed most. They are the ones who show us what it means to be strong, even in the face of adversity.To my grandmother, and to all the grandparents out there, thank you. Your sacrifices do not go unnoticed. Your strength is a beacon of hope and inspiration for all of us. And your love will continue to shape the generations to come.Jean C.

Dothard PetersonFebruary 05, 2025TagsEconomic SecurityHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureAbstractTwenty-four percent of African American women are caring for more than two peoplealso known as compound caregiving. Such caregivers face elevated risks of invisibility, social isolation and loneliness, emotional distress, financial strain, and physical decline due to managing multiple roles, navigating daily multigenerational needs, and caregiving with limited social support. The experiences of African American grandmothers engaged in compound caregiving are less visible in the scholarly caregiving literature. Work remains to be done to educate family members and healthcare providers on providing support that is meaningful and effective from the perspectives of African American grandmothers who are compound caregiving.Key Wordscompound caregiving, African American grandmothers, caregivingAn estimated 53 million informal caregivers exist in the United States (AARP & National Alliance for Caregiving [NAC], 2020). Involvement in caregiving has increased from 43.5 million in 2015 to 53 million in 2020, and women make up 61% of caregivers. Reasons for this growth in caregiving include the increase in Baby Boomers aging into older adulthood, shortages of aging-related services staff, shortages of state-supported home-based care services and programs, more people disclosing caregiver roles, and a combination of these factors (AARP & NAC, 2020).Caregivers tend to be spouses or partners, adult children, siblings, and other relatives or friends. While most care recipients are older adults, care recipients exist across all age groups. The caregiving literature often limits caregivers experiences to involvement with one care recipient. However, two terms that raise awareness of simultaneous caregiving for more than one person are sandwich-generation, which refers to caring for older adults while also caring for children (Raphael & Schlesinger, 1994), and compound caregiving, or caring for multiple family members simultaneously (Marsack-Topolewski, 2021; Perkins, 2010).Caregivers responsible for caring for multiple individuals face elevated risks of invisibility, social isolation and loneliness, emotional distress, financial strain, and physical decline due to their need to manage multiple roles, navigate daily multigenerational needs, and provide care with limited social support (Chang, 2023). Among the 1.12 million grandparents raising grandchildren, 15% are African American (U.S. Census Bureau, 2021). My family relations and research with African American grandparents have brought me face-to-face with the impact of compound caregiving in daily life .Compound Caregiving in My FamilyCompound caregiving has been around me my entire life without anyone ever using the term. Between 2023 and 2024, I traveled to Alabama to attend two of my sisters funerals. My oldest sister provided primary and supplemental caregiving (Gibson, 2014) to her grandchildren, as well as other minor relatives, while adult children or other adult relatives worked or were absent. When my oldest sister experienced a catastrophic illness approximately 8 years ago, she shifted roles from compound caregiver to care recipient.My other sister had not been a compound caregiver, but her adult children assumed this role for years when she became ill. Thus, my two sisters extended chronic illnesses contributed to my nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews becoming compound caregivers. I watched as family members went through the strain of taking care of different generations while working and trying to attend to their own health and social needs. Over time, the number of family members willing to routinely share the daily caregiving responsibilities declined. The usual disagreements occurred about disruption to normal routines, caregiving relief, finances, best approaches to caregiving, and preferences for in-home or out-of-home care.Missing from this discussion of compound caregiving were the family members who relinquished caregiving involvement due to emotional paralysis (e.g., I cannot stand to see them like that), which resulted from watching the changes in the care recipient. One or two adult women tended to assume the caretaking roles. Health-related declines such as loss of sleep, increased blood pressure, psychological distress, and other pre-existing conditions escalated among my family members who were involved in compound caregiving as they sought formal support services to offset their caregiving. My observations depict the nuances of compound caregiving encountered by my family members throughout my sisters illnesses.Profile of African American Women CaregiversTwenty-four percent of African American women are caring for more than two people (AARP & NAC, 2020). These caregivers tend to be, on average, 48 years old and taking care of a loved one who is 65. African American caregivers commonly report 31 hours or more of caregiving per week. Typically, 50% of care recipients live with their caregiver, and these caregivers often do not receive support services while maintaining full-time employment and caregiving (AARP & NAC, 2020). Gradual onset of chronic health conditions can worsen the impact of compound caregiving in African American women.Health-related declinessleep loss, increased blood pressure, psychological distress, and other pre-existing conditionsescalated among compound caregivers.African American women family caregivers often engage in compound caregiving out of necessity rather than choice. As family members try to bounce back economically from COVID, more caregivers assume compound-caregiving responsibilities. Issues such as multigenerational households, historic and contemporary discriminatory practices, limited economic opportunities, and expensive childcare costs can contribute to African American families living with extended family members (Jones et al., 2018; Peterson, 2018). It is common in African American families for grandparents, parents, grandchildren, adult children, and other relatives to live in the same household. These factors were also evident in my own family members experiences with compound caregiving.Caregiving at HomeMomma, Daughter, and GrandchildIn my research on African American women caregivers living with hypertension, one case scenario of the nuances of compound caregiving caught my attention. I interviewed an African American woman who was co-residing with and caring for an aging parent, an adult child, and a grandchild. Three generations representing various stages of the lifespan lived in one household. The grandmother cared for two adult family members living with neurological conditions and a grandchild who had been born prematurely. She was responsible for all the driving and admitted to struggling to manage her own chronic health conditions.This grandmother shared that the compound-caregiving role required her to frequently shift her thoughts, actions, and expectations to meet the individual needs of each family member. Juggling multigenerational caregiving left the grandmother feeling overwhelmed. Power differentials seldom come up when talking about in-home caregiving, yet elements of power emerged in this case, as this African American grandmother financially supplements a young adult child who is still financially dependent upon the adult caregiver for financial and household support. Caregiving at home had become all-consuming and a challenge to the caregivers individual identity.Caregiving at WorkPaid CaregiverIn most cases, we talk about compound caregiving in the home environment as opposed to outside of the home. But the African American grandmother in my research worked in a paid caregiver role outside of the home, too. The following statement reflects what can happen when compound caregiving at home is coupled with full-time employment as a paid caregiver for someone else (Peterson, 2021):Im getting ready to be a grandma for the first time and Im going to have to help my daughter out I never leave caregiving I have a patient that I take care of overnight, and then I come home and take care of momma Im the last one on the list.The grandmother conveys her daily reality as a compound caregiver for a grandchild, adult child, aging parent, and a patient in the community. Moreover, the words I never leave caregiving resonated with me. Kinship caregivers such as this African American grandparent give voice to how the demands of caregiving can quickly become a labor-intensive means of financially supporting the household. The word never occurs when the compound caregiver leaves caregiving at home only for a shift as a paid caregiver for a nonfamily member. The endless cycle of compound caregiving by this grandmother forces her to conclude that her needs are the lowest priority. As this case shows, compound caregivers face several factors that can compromise their well-being.Sleep, Not MoneyA lack of sufficient sleep is an understudied issue related to compound caregiving. The African American grandmother in my research reported sleeping an average of only 2.5 hours each night. Occasionally the adult daughter stepped in with caregiving duties to allow the grandmother more hours of sleep, but the grandmother wanted more help from family members. She admitted to paying for hotel rooms on occasion in order to temporarily escape compound caregiving and obtain quality sleep, but this is not a feasible long-term solution.The grandmothers siblings offered to pay for respite services to relieve her load, but she didnt view these offers as a replacement for caregiving support from family. This grandmother knew she had adequate financial resources to manage the daily needs of caregiving and the household. The stern tone in her voice and her word choice while describing these events suggested that she was offended that family members offered financial support instead of firsthand caregiving support with her aging mother.I must have looked at her [doctor] crazy. And I told her Black people just usually dont do that put our family members in nursing homes.The lack of respite support from other family members contributed to the caregivers increased emotional strain. While other adult family members occasionally visited, the frequency of visits were not adequate to offer relief from caregiving stress. The caregiver refused financial support or other tangible goods to assist with respite because these resources did not meet her most pressing needs. Her family members tend to think that money can take care of all basic needs, but, as told by this African American grandmother, money does not always provide the most practical needs for an overburdened caregiver, such as more and better sleep. We must listen and remain open to what African American grandmothers identify as the resources and supports that will positively influence in their compound-caregiving situation.Cultural Nature of African American CaregivingHealthcare providers may have good intentions, but often have a limited view of the historical and cultural connections of caregiving in African American families. During my conversation with this grandmother, she described a healthcare provider who suggested that she move her parent into a nursing home due to the negative health impacts of compound caregiving. Nursing home placement was not an option for this African American grandmother. Historically, African American families were forcibly enslaved and prevented from accessing institutionalized resources and programs (Boyd-Franklin, 2003). African American caregivers remain more likely to care for family members at home than other cultural groups. Rather than accepting the providers recommendation, the caregiver educated their healthcare provider on caregiving in African American families (Peterson, 2021). She explained,I must have looked at her [doctor] crazy. And I told her Black people just usually dont do that put our family members in nursing homes Unless it just gets so bad I think culturally as African Americans we just old school and we try to take care of them at home my Momma took care my grandmother And I said Im gonna be honest with you, I think its a cultural thing with us. But you know, like we take care of Big Momma, granddaddy. We do what we got to do.Seldom do we talk about African American grandmothers who assert themselves when providers offer suggestions that conflict with their personal and family values. We need to find more ways to support the voices of such grandmothers when they demonstrate empowerment in the face of difficult compound-caregiving circumstances. This caregiver seemed proud to share a history of caregiving across generations in her family. There is reason to be concerned about the health impacts of caregiving on African American women, but not at the expense of denying the feelings of meaning, pride, and control over healthcare decisions experienced by caregivers in the African American community.Managing Stress While GardeningGiven that nursing home placement was off the table, this African American grandmother challenged her healthcare provider to offer other solutions to help her manage stress. The healthcare provider brainstormed with her about how to take yourself to a happy place. Even if its in your childhood, that you remember that made you happy. This one, simple conversation about a happy place stimulated this grandmother to reflect on her most pleasant memories as a child. Notice the outcome of a healthcare provider investing the time to listen and sit with a caregiver while she resolves her own issue (Peterson, 2021). The grandmother stated,One thing I thoroughly enjoyed [as a child] was helping my grandmother plant, work in the yard I literally created an oasis in the yard I loved helping my grandmother, you know, work her flowers and stuff in the yard And I literally worked in my yard 12 hours a day. And thats what I did. And if I had not done that, I dont believe I would be here talking. And thats the honest God truth.Near the end of our conversation, this grandmother shared with me that she had been outside working in her garden the entire time we were talking. She stunned me with this disclosure because the interview had lasted approximately 2 hours. She had arranged with the city to zone her mothers yard so that she could have flower beds. Her oasis in the yard expanded when her adult children gifted her a greenhouse in her garage that she could use to grow year-round vegetables.The produce became a community resource shared with family and neighbors during the COVID pandemic. This practical solution to stress management reveals the power of caregivers engaging in problem solving to improve their health and quality of life.Compound Caregiving TakeawaysIn closing, compound caregiving by African American grandmothers is not new. African American grandmothers and their voices are often hidden or isolated in conversations on compound caregiving. The ability to obtain quality and quantity of sleep is vitally important to the health and well-being of all caregivers. There remains work to do around educating family members on providing support that is meaningful and intentional from the perspective of African American grandmothers. Cultural aspects of caregiving continue to be relevant to African American families.We need more healthcare providers who can engage in person-centered conversations to support African American women on their caregiving journeys, especially in instances of compound caregiving. Keep in mind that the most promising stress-management solutions can come from African American grandmothers. More attention to compound caregiving by African American grandmothers can enhance integration of their cultural values and voices to better tailor interventions and advocacy to their caregiving needs.Tina L.

Grandmothers helped grandchildren cope by assuring them they could stay for as long as they wanted or by promising they (the grandmothers) would never leave; helping children reframe narratives about parental absence; using empathy and truth-telling to help children recover from sporadic parental involvement; allowing children to decide what to call their grandparents and how to explain their relationship; relying on talking/listening to create a sense of safety; and seeking institutional support.Key Wordssocial development, emotional development, parenting, coping strategies, grandparent caregiving, skipped-generation households, grandfamily, kinship careGrandmothers fostered healthy social and emotional development among their grandchildren in part by helping them cope with emotional difficulties resulting from three contributing factors: parental absence and presence, grandfamily stigma, and prior adverse experiences.Parental Absence and PresenceLike other children living in skipped-generation households, children in my study experienced a range of parental involvement, from no involvement to sporadic and regular involvement. Consequently, grandmothers confronted a range of childrens emotional responses, including separation anxiety and separation anxiety disorderthe latter characterized by extreme distress in the absence of a primary caregiver. Research has shown that children raised by grandparents often experience disrupted attachment relationships with their birth parents, placing them at increased risk for emotional distress (Blake et al., 2023).Although this piece brings attention to how grandmothers addressed childrens social and emotional difficulties, its important to note that the majority of grandmothers I interviewed insisted their grandchildren loved their mothers, even if they werent in their care, and some grandmothers mentioned the childrens attachment to their mothers. A minority of grandmothers made the same claims about the childrens love and attachment to their fathers.Grandfamily StigmaRegardless of increases in non-traditional familiesincluding grandfamilies, adoptive, same-sex, blended, married-like, cohabitating, and multigenerational familiesthe biological parentchild, nuclear, heterosexual family is still considered the ideal or normal family. Privileging the heteronormative, biological, nuclear family over non-traditional families is reflected in childrearing institutions, laws, and public policies, as well as in American social norms and values. Children whose family structures are characterized as non-traditional may experience feelings of marginalization if perceived as different. Thus, grandmothers often helped grandchildren cope with social stigma related to their family structure.Adverse ExperiencesGrandmothers also helped their grandchildren cope with the impact of adverse experiences on their social and emotional development. Often children faced numerous difficulties before coming into their grandmothers care. Previous research shows that the more adverse experiences in childhood (e.g., physical and emotional neglect; physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; mother treated violently; household substance abuse; household mental illness; parental separation or divorce; incarcerated household member), the greater the likelihood of developmental delays and other problems (Center on the Developing Child, 2007).In the next three sections, I discuss how grandmothers strategized to mitigate the impact of emotional difficulties on their grandchildrens social and emotional development.Dealing with Parental Absence and PresenceGrandmothers sought to fill the void created by parents inability or unwillingness to be there by being present, assuring grandchildren that they could stay with them for as long as they wanted, and/or promising that they would never leave. Fifty-year-old Dorothy, who used Child Protective Services and the police to become her grandsons legal guardian and keep him in her care, captured the essence of some of these assurances:He [her grandchild] said, Grandma, I dont wanna go with my mom. I wanna stay with you. And I said, You dont ever have to go anywhere else, you can stay with grandma. And when he seen his mother coming he said, Grandma, dont forget I wanna stay here. And I say, You dont ever have to go. You can stay right with grandma. Sixty-three-year-old Cora made a similar promise to her wary 15-year-old granddaughter:She sit down one day Girl, it hurt me so bad. She said, Everywhere I go somebody put me out. I say, Why you say that? My mama she puts me out. I say, Grandmamma neverll put you out. I said, I never will put you out. And she got like a lil smile on her face when I said that. That hurt me so bad. I never will forget that.Being there was complicated by the childrens separation anxiety and abandonment fears. Grandmothers combated separation anxiety by explaining any anticipated absence, reassuring the children that it would be temporary, or sneaking away in hopes that their temporary absence would go unnoticed and not cause further emotional harm. Although Barbara, 41, had been raising her 4-year-old grandson Shaquille since he was an infant, he still suffered from separation anxiety. Barbaras fianc had encouraged her to assume responsibility for Shaquille and helped her raise him until his recent imprisonment, which exacerbated Shaquilles separation anxiety.She explained, Anybody that he gets connected to he doesnt want them to leave because mama already gone, then daddy (grandmothers fianc) gone now. Its like, Oh is mommy [Barbara] gonna go, too? So, I have to reassure him mommy not going nowhere. The only way I leave you is when mommy go to heaven. I understand you dont want me to go but sometimes mommy have to go and mommy have to do things without you.Forty-one-year-old Sylvia was a grandmother who dealt with their grandchildrens separation anxiety by sneaking away. Although Zoe was a happy child, she struggled with separation anxiety, complicating Sylvias need for parenting breaks.Grandmothers negatively impacted by their grandchildrens emotional challenges negatively impacted their grandchildren.She said, When I snuck out the other night, my daughter watched her for me. She was by the door in her highchair, so I didnt go out that door, I went out this door. And my daughter said, Mama she was all like, Where grandma? Where grandma? And my daughter said, Mama, then she started getting all sad. She kept on saying, Grandma gone be back? Zoes sadness made Sylvia feel bad for taking her infrequent reprieves from caregiving. While the majority of grandmothers shared that they were attentive to childrens separation/reunion reactions, absent formal support, some were themselves negatively impacted by their grandchildrens emotional struggles. Sylvia was one of several who admitted to depression, feeling trappedat home with her granddaughter day in and day outwhich created a feedback loop: grandmothers negatively impacted by their grandchildrens emotional challenges negatively impacted their grandchildren.Eventually, Zoes clinging to her grandmothers every move caused Sylvias youngest child to regress emotionally as he vied for his mothers attention, illustrating how being there was complicated by the childrens emotional struggles and their impact on grandmothers and other household members.Grandmothers routinely faced the daunting task of explaining parents absence and helping grandchildren craft a perspective that would nurture, rather than undermine, their emotional well-being. Dorothy typified how grandmothers responded to the ongoing effects of parental absence:One time he said, Mama, why dont I see my mother and dad? They must be dead or something. I said, No, theyre just not around. He said, Mama, everybody else mama and daddy bring em to school. My grandmama brings me to school. And Im sad. I said, Be thankful to God that you got somebody to bring you to school. Your grandma is here for you. You gotta be thankful to God for that. Dorothy, like many others, also had to help her grandchild cope with parents presence; specifically, the negative effect of parents coming and going. Younger children acted out (e.g., tantrums, bed-wetting, potty accidents), and older children often blamed grandparents for non-reciprocal parental attachments. Whenever Dorothys grandsons mother Tyronica came around, he act[ed] out. And it take him a while to calm down. But I tell her [Tyronica], Thats his way of saying Im angry at you. Barbara helped her grandson Shaquille recover from his mother Talishas sporadic involvement and her behavior when she spent time with her son, including bringing him age-inappropriate gifts, showing up with different men, and showing up high on marijuana. She described:Sometimes when he would be with her, he would come back and have nightmares and his attitude would change. And he would regress. Because he was having accidents with her when he wasnt having it with mepotty accidents. And she would spank him. And he would come back and he would be crying, Oh, Im a No, baby. If you pee on yourself its alright. So, I had to fix that part. Because today he still cries if he about to have an accident. And like the nightmares she would leave him in the house while she go out. He wanna be with her but she sneaking out, then hed wake up and shes not there.Similarly, 58-year-old Lottie had to manage her three grandchildrens emotional well-being when their mother Rachel visited. Lotties 11-year-old granddaughter Audra wet the bed when her interactions with her mother upset her. Lottie shared how she created safety for her granddaughter, who was hesitant to tell her how she felt, saying,The only time shell wet like that is if her mama say something to her and then she dont come and tell me. Ill say, How come you didnt tell me? Mama told me not to tell you. I dont care what she says, she do something to you, you gotta come and tell me. Lottie routinely reprimanded Rachel for coming into her home screaming and hollering at her [Audra] and threatened to terminate her visiting. Grandmothers managed the delicate balance between not severing their grandchildren from their parents and using whatever power they had to shape these interactions. Lottie used her legal guardianship to prohibit Rachel from interacting with her children when she felt she was unsafe to be around.Grandmothers learned to be empathetic to the acting-out associated with parental visitations as well as to the negative behavior resulting from parents failing to visit. In both cases, they strived to balance understanding their grandchildrens experiences and arming them with the truth. The father of Laverne and Leonards five grandchildren had recently moved and gotten married. His childrens pre-existing difficulties dealing with his absence were exacerbated by his departure and new relationship. Laverne, 54, showed how sensitivity and talking were critical to helping children process difficult emotions, and how grandmothers changed their approach as children got older:Now that theyre getting bigger its a little rougher to deal with because when they were little we could just grab em and go to Chuck E. Cheese or go to the beach. Theyre too big for that now. Theyve started to see things more for themselves He (grandson) was trying to smell his tail as old folks used to say. So, I have to break things down to him every so often and catch my mouth and remember that he hurt, and he a child and dont understand. You just dont want me around my daddy. Baby, stop that lie. Dont never let nobody tell you that lie. Ive never stopped him from being around you or coming to get you or whatever. Dont ever let nobody tell you that I aint trying to fight nobody for nobody kids. I kept you for a reason; to keep you safe, to raise the five of you together as brothers and sisters. Grandmothers learned to be empathetic to the acting-out associated with parental visitations as well as to the negative behavior resulting from parents failing to visit.Children experienced a variety of reactions to parental absence, including anger, self-blame, emotional regression, acting out, and depression. When their individual coping strategies didnt work, grandmothers sought institutional support to help their grandchildren deal with their emotional difficulties.Laverne demonstrated grandmothers use of institutional support, returning to Michael Reese Hospital (where her grandchildren had been treated for minor illnesses and surgeries) when she noticed a change in her 14-year-old granddaughter Kebas behavior after spending time with her father:Well, I just recently took her and had her talk with a psychiatrist at Michael Reese Hospital. And he put her on this medication. I dont know. Keba got a lot of anger towards him (dad). But then she had a lot of love for him. So, things were just back and forth, back and forth. Then when she came back home, it was pretty much she brought some of it with her. And I just kept seeing different actions from her that concerned me, so I took her to the doctor. Mood swings. a difference in her behavior. She take her Lexapro three times a day and the other one she just take a half of it it seems to help keep her calmer. She dont fly off the handle as fast, as easy.Beulah, 58, was also managing her granddaughters response to not being in her parents care. Her experience spotlighted the importance of social service organizations offering services to kinship caregivers seeking treatment for grandchildren. For instance, in support groups, where grandmothers felt they could openly share their caregiving experiences, they learned a great deal about obtaining the resources and services their grandchildren so desperately needed. In Beulahs support group, grandmothers bounced ideas off one another before plotting a course of action. Concerned that her granddaughter was taking things from her to give to her mother, who was raising her six siblings, Beulah shared and was encouraged by fellow participants:And then there was a time where I had laid money on the table and the money walked off. And things that I put in the refrigerator and things would just walk off and just disappear. And nobody seems to understand where. I mean, even like gold, diamond rings, and all that kind of stuff was just disappearing out my home. So, I was talking to the other people about the incidents and things that happened. So, they say Well, Beulah, why dont you call LaRabida [a hospital known for helping troubled children] and see if you cant get a psychiatrist. Because its a lot of times stuff may be going on that you dont know. Childrens behavioral problems, especially habitual lying, stealing, anger, and acting-out in school, strained grandmothers capacity for empathy. These problems not only challenged grandmothers ability to exercise empathy, but also exceeded their personal resources. In these cases, many grandmothers resorted to informal support systems and institutional ties such as healthcare providers, caseworkers, and educators. Assistance from formal support consisted of assessments aimed at getting at the heart of childrens behavioral issues, advice on symptom-management, medication for symptoms, and mental health services. Grandmothers who sought institutional support were better able to care for children with complex behavioral and emotional conditions than those who did not.Managing Grandfamily StigmaExisting research focuses on the stigma grandparents experience as primary caregivers to their grandchildren (Hayslip et al., 2020); however, I found that grandmothers were less concerned about their own stigma than their grandchildrens. Although 41-year-old Sholanda and her husband had raised Dana since she was a newborn, Shalonda still introduced herself as Danas grandmother, which yielded a recent conversation with Dana. Shalonda explained:She got me in a corner and she said, Mama, I been intending to talk to you. Can you quit telling them people you my grandma? And I think maybe now shes at the age where like with school things and things that she do everybody there with their mother and father. So, she call us Mom and Dad so you wouldnt know unless we told you. So, she said, Can yall do that? So, I was like, Okay I aint got no problem with that. Because shell tell people if she wants them to know.Shalonda was one of many younger grandmothers who agreed to be called mama. Unfortunately, older grandmothers were unable to pass as mothers, making it more difficult for them to reduce a childs stigma, as 81-year-old Virginia described with her great-grandson:At school the other kids moms and dads are there. Who is there with him? His grandma. They say, Oh, Omar heres your grandma. It hurts. And the other day we went to his competition for the band, all the parents were there waiting in the cafeteria, because they had their solo competition. And Im sitting there. He had told his mother, this time she came. Gregory, one of his little classmates, he told Gregory when he came back from the judges, See, Gregory, I told you I had a mom! Isnt that sad? I wanted to cry.Marian, 74, had a different response to her great-granddaughter Milenas stigma. When Milenas teacher corrected her, telling her that her great-grandmother was not her mother, Marian pulled the teacher aside, telling her that it wasnt her call to make that distinction in front of other people. It makes her feel less than, or like shes deficient in some kind of way. Although Marian reprimanded Milenas teacher, she was unwilling to privilege parent-child families or to be complicit in further stigmatizing grandfamilies.She said, Milena started that crap with me, coming to pick her up. Everybody else saying mommy, so shes running up to me saying mommy. Because she wants to belong. And I greet her and I say, Ooh, shes not here. But Im here. And who am I? Well, I know, youre grandma, butI said, Mmm hmm, yeah. And guess what? I love you two times and they only said love them one time. Until she can understand it.Marian didnt stop at damage control with her great-granddaughter but worked to change the perception of grandfamilies among the children in her school:And then I made myself visible more, in terms of her field trips and just volunteering, until the other kids began to want to be with me more than they wanted to be with their mommies, because their mommies were at work. Now, legitimately, their mommies could not be there . But because I was there, Milena saw me as a positive and then the kids saw me as a positive.Marian worked to change the perception of grandfamilies among the children in her school.Grandmothers responded to the stigma their grandchildren experienced being raised in a non-traditional family by agreeing to be called mama, letting their grandchildren decide with whom to share the true nature of their relationship, and trying to mitigate other peoples responses to their family structure. When these strategies failed or when grandmothers were too old to be seen as mothers, grandmothers encouraged their grandchildren to give thanks for having grandparents and other relatives to love and care for them.Caring for Children with a History of Adverse ExperiencesThe circumstances surrounding childrens transition into grandparents care made it important for grandmothers to be sensitive to the impact of any adverse experiences on their grandchildren. Because they saw children as victims of their circumstances, grandmothers went to great lengths to cause no additional harm, including not using physical discipline (or using it significantly less) even if they had done so with their own children. Instead, grandmothers stressed listening and talking to their grandchildren to create a sense of safety.Faith, 48, had been raising her 3-year-old granddaughter, Schuyler, for a year because of Schuylers parents drug addiction, related criminal activity, neglect, and abuse. Faith described the difference between raising her three children (including Schuylers father) and her granddaughter: Because mines, I had to look at them and they knew. I didnt have to open my mouth. This one, I could look at her and she still does. Faith spent more time talking and explaining things to Schuyler than with her own children, with whom she resorted to using physical discipline to get them to behave:Because shes been through so much and I dont want to mistreat her. thats not gone be fair to her, she needs to grow up a happy young lady. She doesnt need to be mistreated; shes already been mistreated for the first two years of her life. Actually, not the first two years but when she was in her mama belly.When Faith mentioned that she didnt want to mistreat her granddaughter, what she meant was that Schuyler wasnt as well-behaved as her children had been and she didnt want to use physical discipline to make Schuyler behave. Faith took into consideration that Schuyler hadnt been taught how to behave by her parents, which meant that she couldnt have the same expectations that she had for her own children. Faith also took into consideration that Schuyler had a history of abuse.Most grandmothers described using talking to get an understanding with their grandchildren, which, as Cora explained, meant addressing disciplinary and behavioral issues without resorting to physical discipline:I dont beat my grandchildren. We can talk and get that understanding. Thats the greatest thing in the world But you dont have to beat no child just all the time, just hurting them kids! You can just sit down and talk with them.While Cora admitted to popping (using her hand to hit them on the bottom) her grandchildren, she distinguished it from whipping or beating them. Instead, she communicated her expectations for and corrected her grandchildrens behavior by talking to them about it.Consistent with other research, getting an understanding required grandmothers to be explicit with language and to talk to grandchildren instead of at them. Marian provided this powerful example, which also illustrates the value she places on maintaining eye contact when communicating:I dont have to hit Milena. I can say Come here. She hates for me to get down on my knees and look at her face. She hates it, you ought to see it, she just wilts like a flower. I get in her face, and I say to her, How many times did I tell you to do that? Do you think Im playing with you? Did you not hear what I said to you? And when I talk low like that, she dont like it. And she just cringes. And shell think about it and shell say, Grandma, Im sorry. I apologize. Would you forgive me? And I say Yeah. Like the grandmothers in Social Work Professor Priscilla Gibsons (2005) research on the ways in which grandmothers raising their grandchildren used communication in their parenting, grandmothers in my study listened to their grandchildren.Because kids got a right to say something to you as well as you have something to say to that child, Cora explained. A child can tell you something. I tell my kids, Grandma got all ears. All we can do is sit down here and talk about it. They trust me. Coras willingness to listen made it safe for her grandchildren to bring her their cares and concerns. Similarly, Marian created an environment where her great-granddaughter could express herself and share her feelings:And then shell come to me and say That was not nice, what you said to me, and I think you owe me an apology. And Ill say to her, Well, let me think about it. Mmm hmm. and I say, Milena, you know, you were absolutely right. I apologize and will you forgive me? She says, yes and then were okay.Grandmothers also used talking to create safety for children grappling with the effects of trauma, as 58-year-old May did to help her 7-year-old granddaughter, McKayla:When she [granddaughter] first moved in with me ... she would have these nightmares about people doing things to her. And I had to sit her down and explain to her, Look, Im not gonna let nobody bother you or hurt you. Your daddys not gonna let nobody hurt you! Your uncle Deangelos not gonna let nobody hurt you, and your auntie Maura. Nobodys gonna hurt you. May was sensitive to the fact that McKayla been through a lot. Because like I say, she didnt get to be a baby. In addition to using talking to create safety for McKayla, May used it to teach and re-teach her:Shes so mature. It rained last week and she said, I can see the rainbow in the bathroom window and the clouds and everything, and I made a wish. And I wished I had a baby. I said, Girl, you 7 years old, the only baby you're gonna get is through those dolls you got upstairs! Miss Dora the Explorer. Thats it! May interpreted McKaylas desire for a baby as too mature, given her age. So, she redirected her to baby her dolls, not to having a baby of her own. Like other grandmothers, May used talking to impart knowledge that corrected misinformation about appropriate thoughts and behaviors that came from parents or others, and from being in what grandmothers perceived as toxic environments. When McKayla urged her grandmother to also make a wish on the rainbow, May also used it as an opportunity to teach her to direct her wishes to God.ConclusionWhen grandmothers confronted issues beyond their grasp or when talking was ineffective, they recognized their inability to create safety, address disciplinary and behavioral issues, and teach and re-teach on their own. The rapport they built with their grandchildren, while critical to their social and emotional foundations, would not protect them in the world beyond their door. In these cases, grandmothers elicited support from their informal and formal networks to provide boy children with role models for manhood, to help children heal from various forms of abuse, to encourage their grandchildren to listen to them, and to reinforce the lessons they were trying to impart. Grandmothers also advocated on their grandchildrens behalf by strategically navigating and using the legal system, healthcare professionals, caseworkers, and kinship support groups to get them the resources and services they needed.LaShawnDa Pittman, PhD, is an associate professor of Ethnic Studies and the Joff Hanauer Honors Professor of Western Civilization at the University of Washington in Seattle.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Monkey Business ImagesReferencesBlake, A.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2024How Splendid to Explore Gender and Age: A Focus on WomenBy Wendy LustbaderOctober 16, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingIts not unusual to wince when looking back at how we saw the world earlier in lifeareas of innocence that became decidedly more complex and nuanced over time, invisible biases that once skewed our perceptions, situations that loomed with great significance yet seemed much less crucial decades later. After all, this expansion beyond our prior outlook marks the accumulation of life experience and perhaps also reflects long-awaited societal shifts. So, whats a little humiliation in retrospect?The issue ofGenerations JournalIm choosing to highlight (Winter 201718, vol. 41, issue 4) takes us through many awakenings as to what it means to be a woman who is growing older.In her essay A Personal, Professional, and Political Journey as a Feminist Gerontologist, Nancy Hooyman recalled one of her key reconsiderations: Upon reflection, I am embarrassed to admit that I once wondered why womens consciousness raising groups were necessary. It wasnt until 1978, when her mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer, that she witnessed firsthand the ageism, sexism, and power dynamics of the health-care system, when she saw providers talking only to her and her fatherand objectifying her mother.Along with economic insecurity and illness, ageism is the greatest social barrier to aging well.Yet in her caregiver research from the 1980s and 1990s, she notes how she joined others in seeing stress from caregiving as a private issue requiring practice interventions that promote personal adjustment (e.g., education, support groups, and counseling) rather than macro-level change (pp. 5758).Though I have long known Nancy as a mentor and a friend, I was inspired by the courage of her self-scrutiny as she describes finally moving beyond a focus on individual burdens:\"Gender matters in healthcare and in long-term care because of the gendered nature of the life course and the resultant inequities experienced by women as givers and recipients of care. [The] interconnections between underpaid care by direct care workers and unpaid care by families, and between low status caregivers and care recipients, must be made visible to ensure gender justice across the life course, especially for women of color and immigrant women.\" (p. 61)Throughout Gender and Age: A Focus on Women, we have a chance to witness several other generative transformations as the personal converges with the professional. In the essay On Being an Aging Woman: An Annual Conversation, Joan Ditzion, Phyllis Mitzen, and Connie Goldman together assert: Along with economic insecurity and illness, ageism is the greatest social barrier to aging well. We needed to start with ourselvesto recognize and deconstruct our internalized ageism. They recount how they decided to reveal their personal stories, to give us a unique way to get to the roots of ageism and how it oppresses us in visible and invisible ways (pp. 131132).I found their individual reflections so impactful that I will summarize them one at a time. Joan Ditzion recounted,the womens movement touched me personally, at my core, like no other social change movement had. The firsthand experience of caring for my mother forever deepened my sensitivity to the needs of aging women. I fully embrace my sense of self as an aging woman and an aging activist. I want to have a sense of agency as I age, to age well with passion and purpose until my last breath, and to work together to mobilize an inclusive, pro-aging social movement to end sexism and ageism. (p. 132)Connie Goldman explained,I began to interview others to find out how they remained active and involved as they aged. I quickly learned that the power of personal stories offers a perspective that facts cannot that together we have power and that we need encouragement to express ourselves. I hope what I say confirms the reality that we are more than old ladies and we can eventually remove the implication that old ladies are used up. Together we can unlearn some of societys attitudes. (p. 133)Phyllis Mitzen recalled,I was a child of the 1950s, brought up with the traditional image of husband as breadwinner and wife tending house and raising children. My mom was a stay-at-home mom. I married in 1962 at age 19, having completed two years of college. My friends and I shared child-rearing as we studied, worked, and talked about what we wanted for ourselves and our daughters. At age 36, I chose social work, deciding that it would give me the broadest practical and philosophical structure with which to address emerging issues. Year by year, I reflect on my personal story and I see no clear path but retain a restless desire to mentor younger women and challenge ourand othersassumptions about women and aging in both the public and private spheres. (p. 134)For those of us who came of age before sexism and ageism had been named and challenged, there has been a great deal to reconsider. These three women had to cast off inner constraints to discover who they could be and how they could defy persistent limitations and stereotypes.The reflex of caring for others first and putting ourselves last must be repeatedly examined.To this day, many of us still find vestiges of the old attitudes in ourselves and others. The reflex to care for others first and put ourselves last must be repeatedly examined so that choices can be weighed, help can be sought, and responsibilities can be shared across genders. At last, we can hold a vision for what it means to be an aging woman who makes room for her own aims in the midst of vibrant relationships full of giving and receiving.As this edition ofGenerations Journal makes clear, many barriers remain. The guest editor Martha Holstein wrote:Old women are everywhere and nowhere. My white-brown hair and small stature render me hyper-visible (shes a little old lady) and then I become either invisible, that is, not deserving of attention, or in need of help, offered in the slow, monosyllabic, deliberate language of Elderspeak. (p. 8)Ageism is still alive and well six years after these words were written. This introductory essay is a gem not to be missed for what Holstein depicts with insight and eloquence,By letting being young and its norms become the default position for all that is good, we fail to honor the possibilities available to us in old age. We ignore what is sad or painful about old age and give too little credit to our capacities for resilience, for coping, for making meaning. Who will defend what we prize if not us? We bow to ageism when we dont insist on alternative language to describe what we are most proud of, or what we enjoy most now that we are old, or what the years lived have meant to us. We may be kinder, less critical of ourselves and others, content with one activity a day rather than five or six, but in our round-the-clock sped-up culture, what value is there in an afternoon spent with a cup of coffee with friends or a book? We may know more, understand more deeply, and come to know ourselves more fully. (p. 9)Each essay in this edition tells the story of finding ways to age with pride as women joining together to reduce economic disparities and other inheritances from past racism, sexism, and ageism. I hope you will read this collection of essays in its entirety. What a treat of self-discovery, even if we might wince at how we ourselves once adapted to or accommodated the confining expectations for womenespecially older womenthat still permeate our society.Wendy Lustbader, MSW, is a clinical professor at the University of Washington School of Social Work, teaching advanced clinical practice.

HooymanAbstract:This article reflects a feminist gerontologists personal and professional milestones in terms of scholarship, policy advocacy, and service-academic administration. It parallels changes that occurred with the womens movement since the late 1960s, and how gerontology shifted from a focus on womens issues per se to a feminist approach that articulates the intersectionality of gender with race, immigration status, social class, age, and disability.Key Words:feminism, gerontology, intersectionality, caregiving, womens issuesAs we gerontologists age, we increasingly recognize that aging is personally as well as professionally salienta realization that was impossible to grasp fully when we were younger and first entering the field. In a special edition of The Gerontologist, in an article called Aging: Its Personal, Pruchno (2017) noted that personal experiences could help identify gaps in gerontological research, theory, and practice. Additionally, Holstein (2015) affirms that our personal experiences are important sources of knowledge. However, when we are trained to be objective scientists, articulating private experiences can be challenging.I am honored by Generations Guest Editor Martha Holsteins invitation to write a personal reflection upon my career pathand to articulate what motivated me to adopt a feminist perspective and how it influenced my personal and professional life. However, it is a humbling, challenging task for someone more comfortable with hearing others stories than sharing my own. I am more at home engaging in scholarship, service, and policy advocacy for equity for others than in self-reflection. That this is so daunting is ironic for someone who agrees with Rays (1999) assertion that feminist gerontologists must engage in self-critique regarding their own attitudes toward aging, while questioning and resisting the status quo. Given my private nature and reticence, I now take the leap of briefly sharing with Generations readers how I came to hold a feminist worldview that has for nearly fifty years undergirded my personal life, along with my research, teaching, and leadership.Never alone in this journey, I have been profoundly influenced by other feminist gerontologists, including Judith Gonyea, Martha Holstein, Ruth Ray, Margaret Cruikshank, Toni Calasanti, and Carroll Estes, to name several.My Pre-Feminist SelfNothing in my background or early academic training fostered feminist inquiry. I was raised in a conservative family in a conservative state and attended a small conservative college where issues of social and gender justice were invisible. Like many women growing up in the 1950s, this was simply the way life wasand not to be questioned. Experiences in my early 20s in the 1960s began to move me away from being satisfied with conventional world views.I lived in Scotland in the mid-1960s, which exposed me to socialism, Marxism, and anti-Vietnam War protestsalthough no inklings of feminism. When I began graduate school in the late 1960s, the University of Michigan was a center of social activism. As a community-organizing student, I immediately became involved in welfare-rights organizing, outraged by economic and power inequalities faced by low-income women, many of whom were women of color. I recognized such inequities faced by other women from more marginalized populations. But because of my own internalized sexism, I did not think about how I was denied opportunities because I was female.Upon reflection, I am embarrassed to admit that I once wondered why womens consciousness-raising groups were necessary. When in the early 1970s I helped to form such a group on campus, I realized the interconnections between the personal and the political, or the private and public spheres. This awareness intensified in my first academic job when I discovered I was paid less than male counterparts with similar qualifications, and joined a successful class action lawsuit challenging gender-based pay inequities.Where Are Old Women in Feminism?The second wave of feminism in the 1970s focused largely on issues of reproductive rights, marriage, childcare, and employment facing younger women. Older women with disabilities and their caregivers were virtually invisible to feminists, reflecting the low status of both givers and receivers of long-term care. I had given no thought to the structural gender-based inequities faced by women as they age until 1977, when my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Confronted by the ageism, sexism, and power dynamics of the healthcare system, I resolved to enter the field of aging with a professional goal that other older women would never be as invisible and marginalized by providers, including social workers, as my mother had been until her death in 1978. Providers rarely spoke directly to her, instead objectifying her as they talked only with my father and me.Flying cross-country with an infant and a 3-year-old to give care, I had no term to name what I was doing as caregiving. I was simply doing what was expected of a good daughter. I had neither autonomy nor flexibility in whether or how I provided care. Nor did I question why my husband remained at home while I juggled my job and our young sons. End-of-life resources such as hospice, which might have enhanced both my mothers and my well-being, did not yet exist in Ohio.A feminist perspective offers a particularly useful framework for understanding the diverse experiences of all groups.Both gerontologists and feminists neglected aging women during this time period. It is striking that women were only added to the Baltimore Longitudinal Survey in 1978; the first older womens caucus was held in 1975 at the Annual Meeting of the Gerontological Society of America; and the 1980 White House Conference on Aging was the first to sponsor a special committee on womens concerns.In 1981, at the formation of the Older Womens League (OWL) during the mini White House Conference on Aging, which was focused on women, I was inspired by the activism of Tish Sommers and Laurie Shields, who recognized the imperative of policy advocacy toward gender justice. And I was moved by the African American women who spoke about their lives at the closing session, challenging Caucasian women, who were in the majority, to include the voices of women of color.Where Is Feminism in Research on Old Women?During the 1970s and 1980s, research on aging moved from ignoring gender, to controlling for gender, and then to describing gender-based contrasts. However, few efforts were made to understand the structural sources or implications of gender-based variations in economic or health status in old age. Older womens poverty often was described as being due to individual attributes rather than a result of gender-based differences across the life course in employment history, childcare, and parent care (or a lifetime career of caring for vulnerable others), all of which underlie career interruptions, types of occupations held, earnings, and retirement circumstances.Even when gerontologists studied older women, they did not always bring a feminist analysis to bear. When I reviewed three new books on old women in The Gerontologist (1999), I asked: Where is feminism in research on older women? These books reflected a gender-neutral or womens issues approach to research samples, models, and theories derived from mens experience. From a feminist standpoint, such approaches are inadequate because conceptually, gender is considered an individual rather than structural attribute, and men are viewed as the implicit standard for assessing womens lives. I argued that it was not enough simply to add women to research studiesan add woman and stir mentalitynor was it enough to document the existence of gender differences without also analyzing their origins, meanings, or social structures that maintain them over time.Because gender is an organizing principle and institutionalized by processes through which people assume masculine and feminine to be natural, men and women experience aging differently. And because feminism begins from womens standpoint and views womens oppression as fundamental to its analysis, womens experiences of aging can only be understood in light of macro-level social, economic, and political forces rather than as isolated results of individual choices. For example, feminists move beyond documenting womens lower retirement benefits to ask why they exist and why they are viewed as natural. Conventional gerontology may frame studies of womens retirement in terms of individual financial responsibility and literacy, while a feminist perspective questions what social and economic structures and policies across the life course make it difficult for women, especially women of color, to accumulate savings despite decades of employment.Moreover, the gender identities that emerge in social interactions across the life coursesuch as caregiving for dependentsserve to privilege men and disadvantage women. Those who are privileged use their greater resources to justify gender-based inequities as natural or based on social necessity, such as implicitly assuming that women will be the primary caregivers. Bringing a feminist analysis to bear on elder caregiving first required a recognition of its absence in feminism and that causes for this are structural rather than individual. Feminism and Intersecting Identities Moreover, feminist theorists not only contend that gender should be a primary consideration in understanding aging, but other intersecting identities should also be incorporated. Early feminist work was critiqued for excluding the experiences of individuals who fell outside of white woman-hood and for failing to acknowledge that being female is experienced differently by individuals in different social classes, of different races, or who identify with non-heterosexuality. I, too, initially neglected to analyze the intersectionality among age, race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and functional ability in both my research and my career as an academic administrator.Caregiving is not only a central feminist issue, but also a life-course one reflecting cumulative disadvantage.In the late 1980s and early 1990s, I attempted to implement feminist values that would benefit all members of the University of Washington School of Social Work. I took what was perceived by others to be the risk of using the f world in my interview for the position of Dean and later sought to use my position to model feminist leadership and mentoring in a large hierarchical bureaucracy. Our social work school was nationally known for its research on women and mental health, an Anti-sexism Task Force, a graduate-level Specialization on Women, courses on older women, and support groups. But these initiatives were attended primarily by white women, reflecting our failure to recognize that factors such as race, ethnicity, social class, and sexual orientation are at least or more important for some women than their identity as female.When we collaborated with other marginalized populations to address intersecting inequalities, we enriched both my feminist analyses and the organizational culture of our school. To some extent, this process paralleled the maturing of the womens movement, which brought a determination to include the often excludednever-married women, older lesbians, working-class women, older women of color, and older women with disabilities. Similarly, Calasanti (1999) argued that a feminist perspective offers us one of the best frameworks for understanding the diverse experiences of all groups.Moving Toward a Caring SocietyIn the 1980s and 1990s, my feminist and gerontological scholarship addressed two separate but interrelated areas: feminist practice in social work settings, and family caregiving. Only in recent years have these strands become interconnected for me as a feminist gerontologist.Not for Women Only(with Bricker-Jenkins, 1986) pointed out that studying women and using feminist analyses are not the same and that feminist perspectives may begin but do not end with women. Instead, feminist analyses help us to understand womens and mens privilege and oppression and the necessity to end patriarchy. Gender relationssocially constructed power relations between women and men that become institutionalized in various social arenasare interconnected with other systems of privilege and oppression. Although my work articulated strategies to implement core feminist principles in practice settings (Bricker-Jenkins, Hooyman, and Gottlieb, 1991), I did not fully address the interconnections between private and public spheres (e.g., that caring cannot be examined apart from the policies surrounding it) until my research on family caregiving.The first wave of caregiving research in the 1980s and 1990s documented family caregiving as a womens issue, but not necessarily a feminist one. Early research, including mine on objective and subjective burden (with Montgomery and Gonyea, 1985), tended to view caregiving stress as a largely private responsibility, with an emphasis on incremental practice interventions that promote personal adjustment (e.g., education, support groups, and counseling) rather than macro-level change. This individualistic approach overlooked how existing structural arrangements within the home (e.g., family care) and work (e.g., womens employment in predominantly low-status, low-income jobs) underlie womens lower socioeconomic status across the life course and their greater incidence of poverty, chronic health conditions, and likelihood of living alone in old age (Hooyman et al., 2002).As noted in my work on younger women, a feminist perspective involves social critique and social change (Hooyman and Gonyea, 1999). Accordingly, I began advocating for feminist policies in the workplace (paid family leave) and public arenas (public long-term-care insurance) to ensure fundamental structural change in social institutions and attitudes (Hooyman, 1992; Hooyman and Gonyea, 1995). Caregiving not only is a central feminist issue, but also a life-course issue reflecting cumulative disadvantage (Ferraro, Shippee, and Schafer, 2009; Poo, 2015).Calasanti (2010) posits that to theorize gender gives us a framework to understand not only why gender differences occur, but also why and how they matter. Similarly, a feminist analysis of care moves beyond documenting womens pre-dominance as caregivers, and a focus on individual burden and supports, to address structural gender-based inequities based on employment and income factors underlying the greater burdens women face across the life course and into old age.I once wondered why womens consciousness-raising groups were necessary.Gender matters in healthcare and in long-term care because of the gendered nature of the life course and the resultant inequities experienced by women as givers and recipients of care. Extending this analysis beyond the private sphere of family care, I later argued that the interconnections between underpaid care by direct care workers and unpaid care by families, and between low status caregivers and care recipients, must be made visible to ensure gender justice across the life course, especially for women of color and immigrant women (Hooyman, 2013, 2017; Hooyman et al., 2002).My Vision for the FutureA feminist lens broadens the questions I ask about caregiving. Now, I am not focusing only on family care, but also on the central role of women as underpaid direct care workers in caring for old women. My more recent work is based on the premise that long-term care is a central feminist issue across populations and across the life course. But most models of long-term care do not start with gender justice. Currently, I aim to integrate my personal and administrative experiences, along with my scholarship on feminist practice and on caregiving, into a broader narrative toward a society in which caring relationships and interdependencenot independence and individualismare truly valued by society as a whole.Seeking to change underlying Western values of familism, privatization, and an ideology of community care, how do we create a caring societyone where those who care for dependent and vulnerable individuals will be cared for by the entire society? Accordingly, my work on direct care workers addresses the intersectionality of gender with race, sexual orientation, immigrant status, social class, and disability. This intersectionality determines who cares for and receives care and the subsequent place in the social order, as well as the disparities faced by care recipients who are primarily old women (Calasanti, 2010; Hooyman, 201415; Hooyman, 2017).I have been influenced by Calasanti (2009), who theorizes that being old confers a loss of power, which is exacerbated by illness, disability, race, and gender. Those who carewhether unpaid or underpaid caregiversfor the old, sick, and disabled (e.g., the powerless), may them-selves experience loss of power, status, and respect, resulting in financial and subsequent health disparities across the life course and into old age. The ways in which these intersections shape womens aging and physical well-being as caregivers and care recipients are embedded in our societys undervaluing of care work.Now I am of the age my mother was when she died. Although in good health and employed, with adequate economic resources, I am living the experience of older womens invisibilitysimilar to what my mother experienced. But 50 years after I first called myself a feminist and began to incorporate a feminist worldview in my personal and professional life, I now have the opportunity to learn from a younger generation of feminists associated with the National Domestic Workers Alliance, Jobs for Justice, and Caring Across Generations.Acting upon their recognition that care work underlies all other work in our society, they are giving voice to low-income women of color and immigrants, who have been marginalized and made invisible (Avila, 2017; Gupta, 2017; Poo, 2015). They put into action the principle that collective action and responsibility are fundamental to feminism. Forming creative cross-cutting alliances and advocating for fundamental change, they offer hope for the future, despite the current political climate. Implementing feminist values and an intersectional approach in all of their interactions, they eloquently articulate that as long as caregiving is viewed as a private duty rather than a public value, the economic disadvantage of women who do this work will continue. Their research, policy advocacy, and social interactions build on making visible the story that addressing inequities within long- term services and supports is central to improving womens well-being across the life course and into old age.Contrary to individualistic lean-in feminism, their voices are central to feminist gerontology and, most importantly, to a feminist future of a caring society, which addresses the intersectionality of gender with race, immigrant status, class, and disability.Nancy R.

This article describes the eleven-year evolution of an annual intergenerational panel and discussion group at the Aging in America Conference. It was created by activists who believe the feminist approach to deconstructing sexism could be a way to deal with ageism, redefine the public perception of what it means to be aging women, and deal with the challenges of aging. The model can be replicated and adapted to stimulate cross-generational activism to help end ageism.Key Words:ageism, feminist, intergenerational dialogue, aging activist, sexism, aging paradigmIn 2006, Connie Goldman, Martha Holtstein, Phyllis Mitzen, and Joan Didion, longtime professionals in the field of aging and longtime members of the American Society on Aging (ASA), realized there was no place at the Aging in America (AiA) Conference where we could talk with one another about our own aging process. We all voiced this same thought: At the Aging in America Conference, lets wear our personal hats and talk about aging as us not them!All of us at that time were prebaby boomersaging women spanning two decades (ages 75 to 62)who had been activists, with second-wave feminists roots. Suddenly Pogos quote, We have met the enemy and he is us translated for us to, We have met old age as professionals and now we are growing old.Thus, in 2006 at AiA, we formed an annual panel discussion group, On Being An Aging Woman: A Conversation. We promised a safe place for participants of all ages (and genders) to give voice to our aging process. Here we could support one another wherever we were in our aging process, recognize and resist ageist attitudes as they oppress us in our journey into aging, and help each other to liberate ourselves from ageist generalizations.Aging is a personal and a political process. It is impossible to age in our society without encountering ageist attitudespersonal, cultural, and institutional. We believed that the feminist approach to deconstructing sexism could give us a way to deal with ageism. Along with economic insecurity and illness, ageism is the greatest societal barrier to aging well. We needed to start with ourselvesto recognize and deconstruct our internalized ageism and the cultural and institutionalized ageist attitudes targeted at us.The womens movement touched me like no other social change movement had.Feeling over the hill, invisible, etc., not only are personal and stigmatizing assaults on womens sense of self, but they are political problems requiring changes in the cultural, social, political, and economic contexts of womens lives. The personal was political then and it remains so now. We believed that we needed to reinvent the womens consciousness-raising groups of the 1960s, but now they would address aging, and be applied throughout the life course. Sharing our personal stories would give us a unique way to get to the roots of ageism and how it oppresses us in visible and invisible ways. Our stories could be the basis of an agenda for social action.For women, the stakes are higher: women out live men and tend to be caregivers. Our well-being and the well-being of our children and grandchildren depend upon us. There arent clear road maps for us, but together we can find a way. We need a new generation of intergenerational consciousness-raising.Personal Reflections on Aging as a Feminist: Joan DitzionReflecting on my adult life at age 74, I see there has always been interplay between my personal life, feminist activism, and my professional workall with a commitment to social justice values and making the world a better place.Looking back, I feel it was fortuitous that I was in the right place in the right time in the late 1960s and early 1970s to become one of the original Founders of the Boston Womens Health Book Collective, now Our Bodies Ourselves (OBOS). None of us would have imagined that the book would have touched the hearts, souls, and minds of so many women here and around the world.I am forever grateful I came of age during the second wave of the womens movement, when a whole generation of women was just awakening to the implications of having been socialized female in a patriarchal society. We began to deal with our internalized sexism, embrace our identities as women, foster a womencentered view of the world, and begin to trust our voices and authentic experiences about our bodies, ourselves, and our lives. We believed that everyone would benefit if we eliminated sexism and embraced feminism and the full economic, social, and political equality of women and men.I was involved with the Civil Rights Movement, and when I was a graduate student at Berkeley I became politically active and was arrested while participating in the Free Speech Movement. But the womens movement touched me personally, at my core, like no other social change movement had. The personal is political.Over the years, I have grown up with theOur Bodies, Ourselvesbook. Initially, I was interested in female identity and in claiming a nonsexist, womencentered view of the world. When I chose to become pregnant, my focus shifted to affirming parenthood (if chosen) in the context of reproductive justice for all, raising the next generation, and the importance of society supporting caregiving, childcare, and workfamily balance. This is still the unfinished business of the womens movement.The OBOS project led and inspired me at age 42 to become a geriatric social worker. I have always felt a synergy between the values of the social work profession and my personalfeminist values, which have informed my work: writing, clinical practice, teaching, conducting workshops, and advocacy. The firsthand experience of caring for my mother forever deepened my sensitivity to the needs of aging women.Im personally devastated by the election of Donald Trump, the rise of misogyny, and the fact that sexism is still alive. But it inspired activism and has gotten us back to our roots. The current generation of younger women now understands and has born witness to misogyny; these women more deeply understand the negative impacts of patriarchal power. Diverse women of all ages are stepping up to the plate: we will find ways to work together, young and old, to build on the past and nurture female friendship across generations to defend and protect the advances made, oppose reversals, and end ageism.I fully embrace my sense of self as an aging woman and an aging activist. I want to pass on my legacy to a younger generation and continue crossgenerational conversations as we do on this annual panel event at Aging in America. I want to have a sense of agency as I age, to age well with passion and purpose until my last breath, and to work together to mobilize an inclusive, proaging social movement to end sexism and ageism.Personal Reflections on Aging as a Feminist: Connie GoldmanI was a mother raising one girl and two boys in the 1950s and 1960s, a time when very few women had emerged from the homecentered role. I wanted my children to understand that women were beginning to accept roles outside the home, in addition to managing an orderly household, and that both could exist simultaneously. In the mid-1970s, when my career in public radio started, I was working with a majority of males. I struggled at Minnesota Public Radio and National Public Radio to establish myself, and the validity of women, in the world of journalism.In those days, broadcasting was a maledominated workforce and society thought women belonged at home. It was a time when people commonly disregarded the female point of view if it conflicted with the male perspective. I had to find less aggressive ways of presenting any ideas for change, and learned to become very subtle. If I had an idea, I avoided conflict and rejection by suggesting that a male had inspired it. It was more important to me that the idea be implemented than to fight for credit.In the 1980s, American culture was focused on finding ways to avoid and deny discussing aging. On my birthday, greeting cards arrived containing implications that I was heading into a time of life that I should try to avoid. I wasnt much cheered by them. Hey, we loved turning 21; it opened new worlds. Why wouldnt additional years continue to present expanding horizons? What if we looked at midlife and years beyond as a quest, not a crisis? Maybe our later years would be richer if we labeled them mature instead of old?I began to interview others to find out how they remained active and involved as they aged. I quickly learned that the power of personal stories offers a perspective that facts cannot, yet also offers a source of comfort and inspiration. We hear a story and we laugh, cry, empathize, and sympathize. Insight, inspiration, and new possibilities can arrive as we learn about ourselves through the stories of others.Our annual panel is and has been a reminder that together we have power and that we need encouragement to express ourselves in accepted and appropriate ways. It is an important experience for us all as we face individual changes and challenges. In my earlier years, I earned the gift of validation, which has brought me to a time of life, at age 86, where I am working not only by example, but also by the words I write and speak. I hope what I say confirms the reality that we are more than old ladies and we can eventually remove the implication that old ladies are used up.Im hopeful our AiA sessions On Being an Aging Woman will help others to welcome their later years. Together we can unlearn some of societys attitudes, and by telling our stories with honesty, we can inspire others to stay active.Our Panel Discussion Groups Eleven-Year EvolutionOur panel of women is diverse, representing different decades, starting with those who are in their 50s, and our diverse audience has ranged from people in their 20s to their 80s. Each year, we attract loyal followers and new audiences.We invite new people to join our core panel to represent intergenerational activism and to give an authentic voice to womens experiences and stories at each decade (Eleanor Browne, 20092011; Pat Pullens, 20122014; Catherine Williamson, 20162017).We panel founders also have aged, passing the milestone years of 65, 70, 80, and 85, becoming grandparents, adjusting to new patterns of work and retirement, dealing with health challenges, and losing parents, partners, and friends. We were conscious about the changing place we held in our social, political, economic, and cultural positions in society and talked each year about finding ways to adapt and cope. Our goal was to inspire participants to apply principles of the consciousness-raising process in their personal and professional lives, and to replicate or adapt the model back home.The feminist approach to deconstructing sexism could give us a way to deal with ageism.The panels discussion session starts with each panelist spending three to five minutes responding to the question, Can you give examples in the last year when age-related challenges felt particularly central to your identity? How did you feel? The audience reflects on the panelists experiences, and we then divide into intergenerational groups of four to five to discuss a question that enables audience members to reflect on their own aging processes. The room buzzes with conversation before audience members report back to the larger group. The conclusion is an open discussion on implications for resisting ageist attitudes.Some of our sample discussion questions include the following:In what ways has your aging process shifted the priorities in your life from what they were last year, both in your internal process, and the way you relate to the world?Has your aging body led you to make any specific choices about how to live your life?What does a good old age mean to you? What do you fear most about becoming an old woman?In our youth-obsessed culture, how do you accept the natural changes in your aging process and not give in to cultural attitudes that devalue us as we age? How do you deal with your own internalized ageist attitudes?How do you react to your face in the mirror? What do you see?How has the role of friendship in your life changed as you have aged?This annual AiA session allows space for authentic dialogue among our age cohorts and across generations, as together we rethink the aging paradigm and co-create new narratives.The themes that arise are rich in the diversity and complexity of womens lives. We talk about our roles as caregivers for parents, and about spouses, children, grandchildren, lovers, and friends. We talk about divorces, widowhood, and loss. We talk about the power of community, particularly as we transition from work (including ageism in the workplace) to retirement. We talk about changing living environments as we downsize or anticipate moving to age-segregated housing, and the financial implicationswill I have enough money for the rest of my life?Legacy has been a thread that wove through many conversations: how can we engage in meaningful activities while passing on our legacy to future generations? We talk about the many changes happening in our bodies and societys pressure on us to stay young. We talk about coping with the inevitable changes in our health, accepting new vulnerabilities as we uncover hidden suffering, along with acceptance of these changes. There is always the lingering question of Who will care for me? And this leads to off-shoot questions: Who will I survive? How will I face my own mortality?At the end of our session, the panel routinely challenges the group to think about how its collective conversation can be a starting point to reform societyto rethink lifecycle stages, to address gender and intergenerational inequalities, to end ageism, and to activate womens voices in public and political spaces.A Few Final ThoughtsPanelists at our AiA sessions are all aging activists and are highly motivated to change the public perception, redefine the narrative of what it means to be women, and to deal with whatever challenges we face as we grow old. Its a hard problem to solve and we have a long way to go.The power of this session has been the ability of professionals in the field of aging to come together to recognize our attitudes, to take ownership and to embrace changes, opportunities, and challenges in our own diverse and complex aging processes. Each year, we learn new insights based on our experience and we acknowledge that the solutions to our problems require collective action. Through our personal learning and engagement in these spirited intergenerational conversations, we discover new ways to fight ageisminternal, societal, and culturalcreate new narratives about ourselves, and contribute to changing the aging paradigm in ways that will help create and drive an inclusive social movement.The model we developed eleven years ago has withstood the test of time and is reproducible in our personal and work lives. We are all professionals in the field of aging and therefore have the obligation to understand ageism and the richness and complexities of aging. Many of us are on the front lines, working every day with aging women and dealing with ageist attitudes, which sometimes emanate from the people we serve or the institutions where we work. As panelists, we offer this model with the hope that it will be replicated and adapted to create consciousness-raising groups in peoples personal lives, workplaces, and communities.All of us have a unique opportunity to engage in intergenerational dialogues, to be role models and mentor younger women, and to provide thought leadership to educate and raise consciousness in the public arena about what it means to grow old. The current political climate has stimulated cross-generational activism.As professionals in the field of aging, and as women, we can once again raise the banner to create a social movement to end ageism.Personal Reflections on Aging as a Feminist: Phyllis MitzenMy path to my career and feminism evolved over the course of life experiences, career choices, and social movements. I was a child of the 1950s, brought up with the traditional image of husband as breadwinner and wife tending house and raising children. My mom was a stayathome mom. I married in 1961 at age 19, having completed two years of college. I imagined myself teaching other peoples children while our children were in school. However, we had three children in rapid succession. In 1965, my father was diagnosed with Parkinsons disease, and had experimental surgery precipitating a debilitating stroke. My mother, with teenagers at home, had nowhere to turn to get help with my rapidly aging dad and turned to me. He died seven years later.All of this took place during the 1960s and early 1970swith children in tow, our family campaigned for Bobby Kennedy, we marched against the Vietnam War, travelled to Washington, D.C., to see Resurrection City (the 1968 Poor Peoples Campaign), and wrote letters to support the Civil Rights Movement.ReadingThe Feminine Mystique, Ms. Magazine, and Our Bodies Ourselves,was revolutionary for me. My friends and I, all PTA ladies, joined the League of Women Voters, ran for local office, and went back to school. We shared childrearing as we studied, worked, and talked about what we wanted for ourselves and for our daughters. There was no clear path for us, only the restless idea that there needed to be a radical reordering of the public and private spheres.My fathers illness and mothers predicament had a profound effect on me. I worked for a brief time in a nursing home, which helped me to realize my affinity for working with older adults. Having an academic mentor who focused on aging was a catalyst for shaping my ideas of what I wanted to do. I thought I could have a positive impact on how individuals age and how our society and culture organizes itself around aging. At age 36, I chose social work, deciding that it would give me the broadest practical and philosophical structure with which to address emerging issues. I chose the University of Chicago in order to study for a masters degree under Bernice Neugarten, a hero, and Shelly Tobin, a mentor. My field instructor schooled me on the insidiousness of ageism shortly after Robert N. Butler first framed it as an ism.All this was at the beginning of my career. Now, toward the end, participation on our annual panel has had a profound effect on me. Year by year, I reflect on my personal story and the stories of hundreds of women and some men. Now, as in the 1970s, I see no clear path, but retain a restless desire to mentor younger women (in the company of colleagues and friends) and challenge ourand othersassumptions about women and aging in both the public and private spheres.Resources for Networking the Experiences of AgingOur annual session at the Aging in America Conference has also provided an opportunity for panelists and participants to share their experiences with the following organizations that embrace aging with all its warts, losses, and possibilities: Conscious Elders Network (www.consciouseldersnetwork.org) Encore (www.encorenetwork.org) Generation to Generation (www.generation togeneration.org) Life Planning Network (LPN;www.thelifeplanningnetwork.org) Pass It On Network (www.passitonnetwork.org). Sageing International (www.sageing.org) The Renewment Project (www.renewmentproject.com) The Transition Network (www.thetransitionnetwork.org)And also of note: At AiA 2016, early leaders in the field of aging and ASA founders gathered to form the Corps of Accomplished Professionals (CAP) as a way to provide meaningful roles for ASA members as they age out of the aging field, or as they age into old age.You may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2024History Repeats Itself on the PageBy Erlene RosowskyOctober 16, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingThis idea of rounding up former chairs of theGenerationsEditorial Advisory Board for a dedicated journal to mark ASAs 70th anniversary is delightful, and something to celebrate, indeed!For 7 1/2 years between 2006 and 2015 I served as chair of the Editorial Advisory Board, and my choices of journal issues that were of particular interest or held special meaning for me (I have hard copies of all of them) are taken from those years.The experience of looking back over the journals prompted a cognitive and affective road trip for me as I recalled all the people who served on the Editorial Advisory Board during my tenure as chair. They were a terrific group, individually wonderful people from whom I learned so much. Some topics we selected as a group in a very careful (and lively!) process were more interesting to me personally and professionally than others, but they all turned into good editions.Two editions jumped out at me for different reasons. One was devoted to a topic relevant to my clinical work: Couples in Later Life (Fall 2007; vol. 31, No. 3). In fact, I contributed an article (Loss of the 'Supplementary Spouse' in Marriages in Later Life)to that edition. (The only time I did so.)But another edition spoke to me as being incredibly relevant, indeed prescient, to what we have all gone through these past 4 years during the pandemic. I'm referring to theWinter 20072008 (vol. 31, no. 4)edition, Disasters and Older Adults. The contributing authors spoke mainly of hurricanes Katrina and Rita (both in 2005), and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and their impacts on older adults.What did we learn that can inform our societal and public health behaviors going forward?I read the edition twice, once when it came out and now, 19 to 23 years later, and identified several points as being similar to our pandemic experience, identifying points of what we did that went right and what went wrong. Most important is what we learned that can inform our societal and public health behaviors going forward.A major difference between the events is that the disasters addressed inGenerationswere unpredicted, singular events. The pandemic, in contrast, had a long runway building up to it, and maintains an interminable 4 years and still counting presence. Where one addressed disaster victims identification and rescue, the emphases of the pandemic were victim identification and care.Where one was rebuilding (after the hurricanes and after the terrorist attacks), the others emphasis was on containment (during the pandemic).A common theme found to be of great importance was the interconnectedness of people who supported the most vulnerable victims, including and especially, older persons. With the protracted disaster, family caregivers, direct care, and healthcare workers, who form the backbone of formal care services, became horribly burned out from the sheer volume of victims and the way the acute phase of the disaster played out across such a vast amount of time. And the sheer volume of deaths. Older persons died in numbers way out of proportion to their percentage in the population.And many, many more suffered while living. They were isolated and locked up with other older people. They shared the virus, became ill, and died together. They were separated from those they loved and who wanted to support them but were not allowed to be with them.We learned that loneliness was a powerful secondary killer. I suspect that many of us hold an image of an older person on one side of a windowpane and a loved one on the other side, both reaching out to the other and denied touch, which is so vital to being human.Those older people who made it into the hospital also were disconnected from the support of their families and friends. Faces were masked. This was especially difficult for older people who rely upon seeing the face and lips to help them hear. And protective masks also muffle sound. Everyone wore gloves, so even skin-to-skin touch was denied. Latex does not feel like skin. Any attempt at cheerful or culturally meaningful attire was covered by surgical gowns.We must anticipate that future health emergency, prepare for it, and use what we have learned.As the severity of the virus made its power known, no visitors were allowed. The burden of providing the fear-reducing, hope-inducing benefits of a loving presence was put on the hospital staff. In addition to their complex clinical duties, they would spend time holding hands with patients, comforting them, and managing iPads for Zoom meetings with desperate family members.We found that those older adults who survived the acute pandemic displayed a remarkable resilience that enabled them to bounce back. We in the aging business know well that older people are more vulnerable than younger people in many ways. And we also know that having survived for many years, elders are often more resilient. Been there. Done that. And lived through it.The COVID pandemic is no longer a pandemic. The WHO has declared it over. The current view of the virus is much like a seasonal flu. As always, older adults are selectively at risk to develop serious illness if they get a virus, and more likely to be hospitalized and die from the illness. If they survive a lengthy hospital stay, they are more likely to be transferred to a step-down facility or a nursing home, where many will live out their lives.Because the pandemic has been declared over, globally we are moving from a reactive phase to a proactive phase to prepare for the next one. And there will be a next one (bird flu is trending in that direction as I write this).We must anticipate that future health emergency, prepare for it, and use what we have learned from prior ones. Besides supporting the laboratory science that will help us to avoid and cope with the next virus, to minimize its spread and lethality, we need to remember the power of connection and how we can enable that. We must recall that putting old vulnerable people together might not be smart, even if it is expedient. We must understand that older people do not move well, and that a reasonable risk for them to remain in place is sometimes better than moving to someplace better.Preparedness also means attending to the runway as well as the acute and post phases of a pandemic disaster, as we are still learning. COVID is not over for the many who have long COVID, for instance. The disaster is not over for older folks who are still isolating in place because they are afraid to resume their pre-COVID lives. They are more at risk of dying from the isolation and the loneliness than they are from the virus in its present iteration.We were caught unprepared, and older people took the hit first and hardest. We need to make sure we support our public health system and keep it provided with whatever it needs to attend to the next disaster. And the federal government and media need to be prepared with clear public service announcements to keep us all up-to-date on what is coming, to the extent that it is known, recognizing that some disasters come out of nowhere. But many do not.Erlene Rosowsky, PsyD, FGSA, is professor emerita in the Clinical Psychology department at William James College (WJC).

What has happened to challenge and stress the marital bond? What challenge with which they cannot cope is the couple facing now? Is the challenge itself so daunting, or rather, are the resources available to address it inadequate? After all, the couple has a long history of individual and dyadic coping that has been strengthened and refined over the years, and has been applied to numerous challenges. So why now?As a clinician, I often train a diagnostic lens on the individual, appraising what change might have served as precipitant to the current distress. The same questions can be posed when looking at a couple. Is there a new personal challenge for one of the partners? A change in medical condition or medication? Or did something happen to the couple to engender the distress? Has the couple been unsettled by a move, perhaps? Or retirement from work?These frequently occurring events in older age can contribute to structural changes within a marriage, often of sufficient power to cause distress in one or both spouses. The clinical literature addressing these events is extensive. The theme of loss and its impact on the marriage is of continuing importance in later lifemost significant, of course, with the eventual death of a spouse.There are, however, other losses, often connected to transitional events, that are powerful yet less well identified as contributors to significant structural change in the marriage in later life. These are para-spousal losses, that is, losses of a significant person who plays a very important role in the life of one of the partners in the couple, but is not the spousethus the idea of the supplementary spouse.While many, perhaps most, marriages in later life are most fittingly thought of as dyads, some are more appropriately described as triads. An apt metaphor could be that of a tripod, a frame with three legs supporting something, in this case a marriage, wherein sturdiness and stability rely on functional intactness of all three legs. In these marriages, the supplementary spouse is the third leg of the tripod.While the specific relationships are different, all supplementary spouses serve a common function of supporting the marriage. When this critical support is lost, the effect is to bring stress upon the marriage. Consider the supplementary spouse as a supporting beam in a building structure. If this beam becomes damaged or collapses, the consequence can be that the entire structure becomes damaged or collapses. Sometimes the loss of a supplementary spouse is behind the presenting problems that come to clinical attention.An important but often unrecognized relationship must be taken into account.The major functions of marriage in older age (truly, at any age) are collaboration, companionship, support, intimacy, and self-continuity; the supplementary spouse serves to fulfill these functions well. The supplementary spouse, thus, is an integral segment of the marital triad. Included in this collection of relationships, among others, are the long-term lover, the intimate friend and confidante, the work companion, the work wife, and the recreational buddy.In the case of the long-term lover, an affair often develops over the years into a parallel marriage with defined rules, roles, and responsibilities and the lover now aparallel. What begins as a relationship outside the primary marriage evolves, over the long term, into a parallel marriage defined as a committed life-partner relationship. Over time, the edges of the two marriagesonce having been parallel, maintaining a constant distance apart and thus never meetingoften become increasingly comparable and, not unusually, meet and cross.Loss of the parallel spouse can have an enormous impact on the primary marriage. An unsanctioned, hidden bereavement occurs; it cannot be comforted by the primary spouse, or possibly by anyone, as it has been held secret. From another perspective, it is not uncommon for the parallel spouse to provide supportoften concrete and directwhen the primary spouse functionally begins to fail. The parallel spouse may become a de facto case manager for a primary spouse who increasingly needs care as a dementing disorder progresses, for example.Marriages also can be greatly stressed upon loss of a special friend of one of the spouses. It is not unusual for a friend to have become a supplementary spouse, for example, when ones primary spouse is unable (for any reason) to be present, engaged, and emotionally supportive. Frequently a special friend becomes a confidante and fulfills these functions. When this special friend is lost, the one left behind turns to the primary spouse seeking to replace this emotional support, and once again is left wanting. The spouse who is unable to provide this support and fill the vacant role is left feeling bewildered and inadequate.The work companion and work wife are other supplementary spouses who can provide a frame for self-continuity, which typically comes to an abrupt end with retirement. I treated a man for a reactive depression after he lost his supplementary spouse when he entered retirementeven though he had been looking forward to retiring. For over forty years, he had carpooled with another man who worked in the same office. They traveled to and from work; an hours drive each way. They had spent ten hours each week together, for over forty years, talking, sharing their lives, hopes, dreams, and demons. They had not developed a pattern of socializing outside of work; their relationship was strictly work-bound, and so when retirement occurred, they each lost, at the least, a most special friend. For my patient, his friend had evolved into a supplementary spouse who came to know more about what he held in his heart than did his wife. Raising a family, working long hours to earn a living, had left themthe primary pairrunning on automatic, with little time alone dedicated to cultivating the kind of intimacy he had developed with his friend.Another common phenomenon is the emergence of a work wifesomeone at work who is counted on for wifely duties for his or her boss (a work wife can be of either sex). Occasionally the work wife will evolve into a lover, but that is not the usual script. However, over the years, being together eight or more (waking!) hours a day, the work wife can become a supplementary spouse. When this relationship is lost, it is less the performance of duties that are missed than it is the valued reflection of ones being competent and powerful, especially when this is not the same mirror held up by the spouse at home, and especially for those individuals who in the main define themselves by their work role. The function of self-continuity is often in part secured through a supplementary spousal role assumed in older age by a long-term recreational buddy. The golf widow refers to a spouse who is left behind when one goes off to play the game. Loss of ones long-term recreational buddy can result in a feeling of being widowed, and a deep grief can ensue. This means not only the loss of the person or the loss of support of self-continuity, but also the recognition of no longer being a player, of being at the end of the game.Erlene Rosowsky, Psy.D., is assistant professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and a clinical psychologist in Needham, Mass.You may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2024ASAs Golden Child, GenerationsBy Bob ApplebaumOctober 16, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureJustice & EquityEconomic SecurityHealth & Well-beingOne of the highlights of my career has been the opportunity to serve for 2 decades on the Editorial Advisory Board of Generations, the quarterly journal of the American Society on Agingboth as its chair and as a guest editor for three issues. Each issue of Generations is devoted to bringing together the most useful and current knowledge about a specific topic in the field of aging, with emphasis on practice, research, and policy.I have always loved this topically based journal, and so when the current editor, Alison Biggar, and ASA President and CEO Leanne Clark- Shirley, asked me to help celebrate ASAs 70th birthday by looking back at Generations, I jumped at the chance. They asked me to pick one of my favorite issues, but with so many choices I had to pick three (presented in chronological order).The issues, from three eras, represent all that is great about Generations. One of the greatest things is that Generations has always been able to recruit outstanding guest editors and authors who are excited about writing for the ASA audience.The Nursing Home Revisited(Winter 19951996; Vol. 19, No. 4). This issue on the nursing home is my first selection. It was put together in the mid-1990s and edited by the noted public health gerontologist Terrie Wetle. The issue recognized and acknowledged that we had not solved the challenges of providing high-quality nursing home care in the United States.A powerful beginning was an article from Bruce Vladeck, then director of what at the time was called the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)which does sound a little betterreflecting on his landmark bookUnloving Care: The Nursing Home Tragedy(Basic Books, 1980), which had been written 15 years earlier. After an appointment as the head of the U.S. government agency in charge of funding and regulating nursing homes, he found that the critical view was actually quite different.The articles in this issue are timeless and after 20 years they still hold tremendous meaning.This issue ofGenerations, even though it came out almost 30 years ago, included topics that to this day remain at the forefront of nursing home policy, including nursing home design, specialized facilities, integration with healthcare, mental health issues, resident assessment and the Minimum Data Set, the importance of nursing home consumers and self-determination, and a question about whether nursing homes needed to be completely restructured. The issue included articles by scholars and administrators in long-term services, many of whom remain top researchers and some who have, unfortunately, left us. The shelf-life of this issue is long, and I ask my students who are interested in long-term services to go back to it as an introduction to the field.Listening to Older Peoples Stories(Fall 2003, Vol. 27, No. 3). Moving into the early 2000s, this issue, my second selection, reinforces another major strength ofGenerationshelping us to really hear the voices of older people in the pages of the journal. Again, an all-star lineup, led this time by Anne Wyatt-Brown, focusedGenerationsreaders on how to listen to the stories of older people. Two icons of this work, Robert Kastenbaum and Jaber Gubrium, told us about the process and importance of hearing good stories.The issue also allows us to hear the voices of centenarians, of individuals experiencing dementia, and of patients rehabilitating from a stroke, and demonstrates how listening to stories can help physicians to better understand and improve medical diagnosis. I always thought this edition was so important because it served to ground us in why we do the work that we do as practitioners, administrators, and researchers. As was the case for my earlier pick, the articles in this issue are timeless and after 20 years they still hold tremendous meaning and impact.Politics and Aging(Winter 20182019, Vol. 42, No. 4). This issue, my third selection, is from the modern era. Edited by two friends and colleagues, Rob Hudson and Robyn Stone, the issue demonstrates yet another strength ofGenerationsa firm grounding in social policy made accessible to ASA readers. Hudson, an academic, who, sadly, we recently lost, and Stone, a researcher and policy maker, bring a perspective to that turbulent time that is truly insightful.Contributions from some of the top analysts of aging policy in the nation take on the critical issues of today, such as state and federal divisions on aging politics, immigration and workforce, the role of women in politics and policy, inequality, and the politics of diversity. As we look at the aging policy debates of today, the topics and discussion of this 2018/2019 issue read as if they were written yesterday. I often used this issue ofGenerationsas a teaching tool, and students find the articles to be informative, understandable, and relevant.Many changes have occurredat ASA, and inGenerations, over the years. The long-time and fabulous editor Mary Johnson retired. The journal covers, which had been carefully modernized over the decades and featured the acclaimed photography of the late Marianne Gontarz, no longer matter in the digital world.But what has not changed is thatGenerations, as a topically based journal, written by top practitioners, policy makers, and researchers for an audience of ASA memberswho work every day to make the lives of older people bettercontinues.Heres to the next 70 years!Robert Applebaum, PhD, is director of the Ohio Long-Term Care Research Project and Senior Research Scholar at the Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.Photo credit:one photoYou may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2024Innovating Like It's 1976By Ruth KatzOctober 16, 2024TagsInnovation & Social ImpactAgeism & CultureSo much progress! Onward and upward we go in the field of aging, especially in policy and advocacy! Look at our sophisticated cross tabulations, be impressed by our rich data and sharp analyses, check out the way we use technology for advocacy campaigns!Weve made so much progress, havent we? Or have we? Clutching our Pet Rocks in 1976, we (or people just like us) waited for the first few volumes ofGenerationsto show up in the mail.Perusing early issues ofGenerationsis a projective test for people who watch aging policy. Frankly, it would be easy to be a pessimist and say, Weve done a lot of talking but really havent come such a long way. Or we can use the history, politics, and popular culture packed into these old documents and take the optimistic high road.The best place to start if we want to activate that plan is to study what they were doing back then. To be like them, we will need to pull together to innovate, educate, and advocate as courageously as they did. You know, before it was so cool to work in gerontology and aging services.ASAs 70th birthday offers a moment for contemplation about where weve been, for an honest and clear-eyed self-evaluation of how were doing, and, most important, for framing and activating a vision of an Americaand a worldin which we all want to grow old. We now have more resources, more targeted programs, more funding, and countless specialties within the field of aging.Check out recent issues ofGenerationson using research to improve programs (Summer 2024, Vol. 48 No.2), aging and climate change (Summer, 2022,Vol. 46, No.2), and mental health (Spring 2024, Vol. 48, No.1). We are so much smarter. Were evidence-based! Those programs put in place in the 20th century have grown. We spent nearly $850 billion on Medicare last year and $1.4 trillion on Social Security. We have a vast Aging Network covering most of the country, an impressive payoff for communities everywhere for that modest $2 billion in federal spending.Reality Is Bleak, We Can Do BetterAfter all the work that has gone on, how is it still possible that most people dont have any idea where to turn when they or an older family member need some help? Why is the number of older people living in povertyincreasing? How is it possible that we only have enough affordable housing to provide a unit for fewer than one third of eligible older people?For one, were living about 5 years longer than we did when those first issues of Generations hit mailboxes nearly 50 years ago; were surviving and even thriving with chronic conditions and diseases that back then were a death sentence.How is it still possible that most people dont have any idea where to turn when they or an older family member need some help?But we need to do betterand we can. We can be bold, like those who gathered at the early ASA conferences and talked about aging, something most people didnt want to hear about. We must embrace the imperative to pioneer that road less traveled. And we have to start innovating like they did.The Fall 1976 issue ofGenerationsincluded an overview of a conference speech by Sen. Frank Church (D-IA). He talked about the administration mounting an attack on every program for the aging. (You could hear the speech again if you had thought to buy a cassette recording$9and if you have a cassette player.)Addressing what I imagine was an audience wearing bell bottoms and leisure suits, with Medicare barely old enough for 4th grade, he talked about a proposal to add catastrophic coverage to Medicare. The proposal, he said, would benefit 3% of Medicare beneficiaries but 97% would pay more.It took another 12 years for theMedicare Catastrophic Coverage Actto come into being, adding nursing home and home care to Medicare benefits, but the measure was repealed a year later, mainly because of the increased tax burden to pay for the expansion. This was the first in a series of policy failures to enact and implement a solution to meeting the long-term care needs of an older population. If that sounds familiar, its probably because, in this century, we watched theCLASS Act(Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act), a modest long-term care entitlement, follow a similar path enacted in the Affordable Care Act, repealed a couple of years later.SenatorChurch may have underestimated the percentage of the Medicare population that would use Catastrophic benefits3% seems low. Of course, now we are better at estimating the need for services and supports as people age. Thats a good thing because people are living longer. Demands are greaterhalf of those turning age 65 today will need paid long-term care before they die. Today, 17% of Medicare beneficiaries, those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, account fora third of program spending.We have come a long way and we are now exponentially more sophisticated at estimating the need for and cost of housing, income support, long-term care, and food for older people. But were not smart enough, nor bold enough, to have a politically viable plan to make it happen.We have figured out how to harness technology in service delivery and management (Generations Today, JulyAugust 2020). We are surely more inclusive (Generations, Special Edition, 2023)older people have more federal protections and accessible environments. And we are really good at sweating the details, at deep understanding.So, lets take that high road. We can take a cue fromOllie Randall, who spoke at the 1976 conference, saying she had lived through the radical changes of the last century and discovered that each of us has the ability and flexibility to cope. She talked about the new generation as a collection of people of all ages sharing concerns for human needs, with chronological age no longer the only common link. She was talking about intergenerational programming and resilience.We knew that a half century ago. The 2,500 people in the audience in 1976 knew it. We owe it to them, to ourselves, and to our children and grandchildren to follow their pioneering spirits and take the next brave steps.Lets commit to each other that we will take all our data, technology, analysis, understanding of needs and functionality, and deep study and use it to come up with fresh new ideas to meet the increasing needs of our aging country.Lets innovate like its 1976! Lets be sure that when ASA members celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2054, the Spring issue of Generations takes a retrospective look at all the progress we made in the second half of the 2020swhen we took a hard look at nearly 5 decades of Generations and realized how much we had learned, then used it to leap forward and make real change.Ruth Katz chairs the Generations Editorial Advisory Board, is president and CEO of the Association for Jewish Aging Services, previously served as senior vice president for Policy at LeadingAge, and for 27 years was associate deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Mulley81587You may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2024Generations, a Voice for Those Affected by the Care Management EvolutionBy Richard BrowdieOctober 16, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureInnovation & Social ImpactHealth & Well-beingThere are many great benefits to being an ASA member, which makes it hard to choose just one to focus on. I became a member of ASA to gain insight into all that I did not know about aging. For 10 years, I had been in what became the Aging Network, had the privilege of being the founding director of an Area Agency on Aging, and had moved beyond my hometown and into the broader, more complex world of aging services.Having learned that aging was a much broader topic than my existing knowledge might indicate, I needed a place to learn more. I wanted a resource that would teach me the numerous ways aging affects individuals, families, communities, states, countries, and even the world at large.But there were additional considerations. As a card-carrying advocate for older Americans, particularly those who are low-income and/or disadvantaged in other ways, and as a fully engaged developer and manager of services to support them, I was looking for a context wherein people whose interests and expertise differed from mine still appreciated what people like me were trying to do.Most people dont understand the constraints under which many of us operate in aging services, or the variables that make serving older people in diverse communities so different from serving people in other contexts. In turn, I recognized that I had limited insight into, for example, the ways faith-based communities taught their members how to face aging in their lives, or how such communities support their members when challenges become overwhelming. I was seeking a resource where I could learn about these different approaches, and where others would be interested in learning more about my world, too.One of the wonderful things about ASA is its commitment to harnessing the insights of its members and sharing them with its membership. Not everyone can attend an annual meeting, and a newsletter can only try to keep up with the streams of activity relevant to aging in America. To fully address some topics requires a deeper dive, one thats accessible to an audience of varied practitioners in a variety of services.Generationsis that instrument, and my belief in its value is why I committed my time to serve on its Editorial Board, including as chair, for many years. ReadingGenerationsand participating in its creative process has been one of the greatest and most satisfying experiences Ive had in my career.The Aging Network is incredibly diverse, and the publicly supported programs comprising the Network have a lot on their plates. It has been an enduring challenge to balance the task of ensuring public accountability with the requirements of mounting and managing these programs and maintaining the capacity to comprehensively and sensitively tailor the responses of a complex system to the needs of real older adults. People need help living in what to them is a unique situation, made up of family, friends, and diverse civil communities, and to do the best job possible within the constraints of available public resources.It was an honor being asked to co-author an article with another thinker and fellow advocate, Larry Polivka.That capacity is the mission of Care Management. AndGenerationsis one of the best venues in which Care Management, in all of its complexities, has been explored, analyzed, and explained.Because Care Management is the tip of the spear in the effort to support older people in a home of their choosing, it is the ultimate act of advocacy for older people in need. For me, effectively practicing Care Management means ensuring that any system responsible for administering the resources to support Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) is animated by a sense of advocacy. The public officials who oversee the larger system must be certain it operates with the highest feasible quality and integrity.That philosophy was embraced and carried forward by the most well-known and effective researcher, educator, and advocate for Care Management this country has ever hadRosalie Kane. Rosalie was the countrys deepest and most passionate figure when it comes to Care Management, and even though the pursuit of money in managed LTC has severely compromised her good work, she deserves a lot of credit for at least requiring a baseline of regard for what older people wanted form the caregivers, especially when the government was paying.Generationshas followed the topic of Care Management as its practice, and the larger system in which it functions, have both evolved. As a long-time developer and advocate for the Aging Network, I had the opportunity to write forGenerationson Care Management and related advocacy issues on several occasions, but none of them felt more important than the honor of being asked to co-author an article with another thinker and fellow advocate, Larry Polivka. The article we wrote appeared in theSpring 2021 issue, and was called, The Future of Care Management in the Aging Network: What Would Rosalie Say? I have to say, it turned out to be one of the most difficult writing assignments I have ever had.Part of the problem was that I had such affection and admiration for Rosalie as a researcher, advocate, and person, so I felt a tremendous responsibility to get it right. I also felt the burden of keeping up with Larry, whose capacity to express his views and passions as a thinker and an advocate is tremendous.On top of that, the guest editor for this edition was Bob Applebaum, who talked me into this assignment, and was in the same league as Larry and Rosalie. Plus, this edition came along at a time when the practices of Care Management were changing again, in large part because by 2021, many states had subcontracted Medicaids management of LTSS to commercial managed care organizations (MCOs), fomenting volcanic change in many states Aging Networks.One challenge was that advocates or people who werent employees or compensated contractors connected to MCOs could no longer examine Care Management practices, due confidentiality agreements, nor could employees and contractors of state Medicaid agencies have access to the Models of Care. Such models were held as MCOs confidential property because they were the secret sauce and constituted the way MCOs could produce better results than their competitors.This was quite a change and cause for concern among people who had been advocates for LTSS, because of the unique role Care Management plays and how it had been regulated prior to the advent of commercial managed care in LTSS.Originally, Care Management was developed as a public good, as part of the advocacy-driven effort to use public resources to serve low-income older people who wanted and needed LTSS in their homes instead of in nursing homes. Because it was the method for effectively reconciling three competing tensions, advocates, state, and federal officials all wanted a part in how it was going to be practiced.And due to the tradition of delegating the operation of human services to state governments, each state wanted and needed to establish standardized and publicly endorsed instruments to be used. From the early 1980s, when the National Channeling Demonstration was conducted by the office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, the federal government needed to know if LTSS (then Home- and Community-Based Services) would work, and all of it rotated around Care Management practice. In Pennsylvania, we had standardized Care Management instruments by 1975. That all began to change with the advent of Managed Care. And theGenerations Editorial Advisory Board recognized the need to raise the question.It was a privilege to be a part of helpingGenerationsto do its job over the years, and here is hoping that it will continue and adapt to the changing needs of the future.Richard Browdie, MBA, is founder and principal at Browdie Consulting, and prior to that served for years as president and CEO of the Benjamin Rose Institute in Cleveland, Ohio, and served several terms chairing the Generations Editorial Advisory Board.Photo credit: Shutterstock/HalfpointThe Future of Care Management in the Aging Network: What Would Rosalie Say?By Richard Browdie and Larry PolivkaAuthors Note:During the past year, the aging network and the world of gerontology suffered the grievous loss of Dr. Rosalie Kane, a tireless investigator, author, speaker, and advocate, who concentrated much of her work on care management. When this edition of Generations was originally conceived, Dr. Kane had agreed to write this article. Both current authors were longtime friends and collaborators (sometimes co-conspirators) with Rosalie, and we have been asked to take on the impossible task of trying to fill her shoes.In addition, we are to try channeling (a little insider humor for those of us who have been around this topic for a long time) Rosalies thoughts into the discussion. It should not be too hard, because Rosalie was an unforgettable person to know and work with. Our article is written as a dialog, in which we tried to include Rosalie as our third participant. We all wish she was still here to bring her invaluable perspective to the discussion.Richard Browdie (RB):My experience is that care management has always been a topic that engendered conflict and passionate debate. Going back to the early 1980s and the National Channeling Demonstration, the appropriateness of having any professional other than a nurse perform assessments and care plans generated concern and argument. As things have evolved, and largely as a consequence of the introduction of commercial Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), care management functions have been broken into component roles, and debate remains about what should be included in care management practice and who should do what.I would bet Rosalie would have been opposed to this development for a couple of reasons. First, fragmenting the functions of care management, such as separating assessment from care planning or separating an ongoing relationship of care manager and plan monitor, could lead to quality concerns. Second, separating those advocating for the interests of the consumer from resource allocation could compromise the decision-making process. Third, Rosalie would likely have been concerned with role continuity problems, which would end up negatively impacting the consumer. And, Rosalie always worried that the pursuit of profitability would inevitably threaten care quality.Another big issue is what should be the organizational setting for care management? For many years, care management was seen as so complex it required highly skilled, experienced people to do it. Further, it needed to happen in a context where no incentives beyond the consumers well-being (in balance with government policy limitations), would weigh on the work of the care manager.This school of thought recognized the role of care management as being a hub in the system, where the constraints of resources, ever present in the public domain, would be wrestled with by the care manager, whose mission was to do as much as a person needed without spending more than was required. Perhaps even more important, the organizational context for that work permitted and anticipated continuous scrutiny by government funders to assure that the sought-after balance was always pursued to the greatest degree possible.Tension existed from the beginning between those advocating for community-based agencies like Area Agencies on Aging to perform care management as it related to accessing services they funded, as opposed to those who felt that because those agencies managed such services funding, it gave them a reason to underserve consumers and stretch their services further to reach more people. Of course, state budget offices saw this as a good thing. But consumer advocates, especially advocates for consumers with severe lifelong disabilities acquired before the traditional markers of old age, lobbied vigorously for a different approach.Rosalie would be incensed to learn that one of the most important roles in the entire LTSS system has been reduced to secret sauce.Advocates for all kinds of consumers came to realize that the main problem was that access to these services was limited by available funding. At the time, most often funds came from the Older Americans Act and a range of other state and local sources, with a few federal sources where discretion was available, such as Title XX of the Social Security Act. Once achieving an entitlement through expanding eligibility criteria under Medicaid became common purpose, the role played by care management became even more important, and pressure became even greater to move it away from community-based agencies. The drive to create broader entitlements to Medicaid services led to an even greater interest in giving control of Medicaid funds over to agencies that could take the risk of negotiating rates for large populations over a year or more. Thus, the role of commercial entities, used to doing this sort of thing profitably in the health insurance field, began to grow in the long-term services and supports (LTSS) arena. And because of its resource-allocation role, care management began to go with it.Rosalie viewed all of this with concern and even distress. Rosalie was a great believer in transparency, particularly into the machinery and the results of care management operations. She knew how important they were to the mission of matching resources to needs for people who, for a number of reasons, may have difficulty articulating their needs and preferences, which is the essence of the care management role. In todays managed-care environment, regulators care about eligibility operations and the ability of a plan to stay within its contractual limits across its contract. Over-serving is not of concern because regulators believe, probably correctly, that no commercial enterprise is going to do more for a consumer than is necessary to satisfy that consumers needs as expressed in the contract. Further, if consumers are unhappy, they are free to complain and the MCOs are expected to satisfy them. How MCOs accomplish this is not really of concern to the government. Plus, in many states the clinical and statistical methods used to guide care planning are considered proprietary, which shields them from public scrutiny. Rosalie did not, and would not, approve.Larry Polivka (LP)Rosalie and I generally agreed upon many issues, especially the significance of the comprehensive Aging Networkbased Oregon and Washington LTSS systems as a model for what LTSS should become in other states. And for a national LTSS policy formulated by Congress and executed through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS). Such a model would center on consumer-, (person)-centered, community-based, relatively autonomous care management of the kind that had by 1990 been implemented in Oregon and Washington in LTSS systems, which included all publicly funded LTSS programs from Home- and Community-based Services (HCBS) to nursing home care.The effectiveness and efficiency of these two state systems inspired a 19941995 effort in Florida to develop a managed-care LTSS model that would combine Medicaid HCBS and nursing care programs under a single capitation-based rate and be administered through the Aging Network that had for several years already been administering Medicaid HCBS waiver-funded programs. The Aging Network veterans planning this new LTSS model wanted to emulate the comprehensive state systems of Oregon and Washington through the Aging Networkbased nonprofit model. This model used a capitation approach to administrative consolidation properly incentivized to shift Medicaid resources from nursing home care to HCBS programs. Political opposition to this new model of nonprofit LTSS led to defeat of proposed implementing legislation, and a variant of the model, the Wisconsin Family Care (WFC) program, is now one of the countrys best state LTSS programs.Rosalie had several concerns about this development and its longer range implications for the future of cost-effective, person-oriented, community-embedded, and comprehensive long-term care (LTC) programs. Foremost among them was the fate of care management, which she had done so much to teach the LTC community, policymakers, and the media to understand and appreciate over the course of her decades of conducting research, teaching, mentoring, presenting papers, and leading conference discussions.The challenge to avoid unnecessary institutionalization is a constant, and the key to effectiveness and efficiency is care management.As Richard notes, she thought that effective care management was fundamentally essential to avoiding conflicts of interest between service providers and those who should be able to decide the kinds and amounts of services LTC recipients needed and could most benefit from in meeting their LTC needs.Rosalie also felt that the march to managed LTC would not just undermine effective, person-focused care management, but also could well end up drawing other critical policy and program matters into the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) black hole and away from the policymakers and administrators normally expected to be responsible for policy and accountability.We have good reason to believe that Rosalies concern was well-founded, based upon what we know about the impact in states with extensive Medicaid Managed Long-term Care (MLTC) programs. Florida, for example, has since 2014 had a statewide corporate MLTC program, and across that time period the many energetic and continuous debates that had characterized the legislative LTSS policy process for years gradually disappeared. The perception that all such matters, from the kinds of services provided, in what amounts, and to whom, to ensuring effective accountability for delivering cost-effective services, were now the responsibility of the HMOs rather than policymakers.The only or at least overriding policymaker concern was that the MLTC model would make the annual budget more predictable and gradually lower than the traditional fee-for-service model of LTSS services. At this point there is little evidence that the MLTSS model is reducing Medicaid LTC costs. In Florida, annual LTC appropriations arent any lower with MLTC. We have clear evidence, however, that the number of Medicaid-eligible persons with unmet LTC needs are increasing by 5,000 to 10,000 annually. This may change now, however, as the state moves to alter the criteria for being placed on the Medicaid waitlist for services, which will reduce the waitlist immediately by several fold.RB:Broad consensus has been hard to reach over what constitutes quality in care management and which factors are more important than others. For a number of years, quality was associated with extensive training and consistent oversight of the people asking questions of consumers, assuring the questions asked met assessment requirements for completeness and internal consistency, and then discussion of a persons needs before finalizing a care plan. Built upon long-standing best practices in nursing and social work, quality in care management was seen as a matter of the amount of time and the kinds of professionals that were involved in the process of decision making, and assuring that the process was accomplishing everything that was required.Over time, this deliberative and time-consuming process ran afoul of budgetary concerns as demand for services grew, and the demands began to grow to make care management itself less expensive and faster. Some places began to place greater emphasis on what we would now call machine learning, after it was observed that even with the discussion of individual detail, the service plans that resulted looked quite a lot alike. Analysis led to the development of paradigms that led to the creation of norms for what to do based on categorizing the number and intensity of needs observed, resulting in the algorithms that MCOs claim in todays market place as their secret sauce.Now, care management quality is seen more as an internal organizational matter, with oversight concentrating on documentation and to monitoring the credentials of the people doing the work, much like home healthcare. This is not to say that a lot of good services are being provided. What this does say is that the care management process itself is opaque to payors and to the public.What would Rosalie say? I think Rosalie would be incensed to learn that one of the most important roles in the entire LTSS system has been reduced to secret sauce. She really saw the importance of doing care management as well as possible to best serve those who needed care on an ongoing basis, particularly in a field like LTSS where the objective and statistical measures of success and quality were so few and far between. And to rely upon consumers to complain enough to be heard by regulators was something she would see as a fallacy, given the well-established difficulties experienced by frail older people, particularly those who have no co-dwelling family or friends to speak for them.Whats In Store for Care Management?RB:So, what does the future hold for care management? it would be easy to simply say that care management as it was known in the Aging Network is dead and not likely recover, except that there are still places where care management is being delivered at a very high level on behalf of payers other than Medicaid, including MCOs in Medicaid Managed Care companies around the country. And, while it is well known that those states that have evolved that way did so because of vigorous and shrewd advocacy by their Area Agencies on Aging, sometimes with the help of and sometimes in spite of their State Units on Aging, they are performing well and are not going to be easily displaced by the plans or their Medicaid partners in state government.At the same time, the interests MCOS have in having as few as possible other non-commercially controlled interests involved with their work in managing Medicaid funds is not going to change, either. Having community-based agencies involved in care management constitutes a check on their ability to exercise discretion in benefit management, which in LTSS means the management of consumers, and they are never going to want it.'Rosalie really believed in the good intensions and good work of the social workers, nurses, and others.'There is no evidence that having care management performed inside an MCO is better, or that it saves money for anyone but the MCO. The states considered most successful in managed LTC or comprehensive care thus far have compelled MCOs to use Area Agencies on Aging as care management partners. However, the fact remains that there is not much evidence based on real evaluation on Managed LTSS at all. So, this remains a topic for debate and opinion.On this, I think Rosalie and I might say the same thing, but for different reasons. Rosalie really believed in the good intensions and good work of the social workers, nurses, and others who wanted to do this kind of work. You must be well-intended to do it well, because it is hard, and you have to care about the people youre serving. So for her, getting the other incentives and obligations out of the way and situating care managers in the communities where their consumers live was so important that any other kind of agency and practice model would always be less effective and less responsive.I, on the other hand, believe that organizational incentives matter. Commercial MCOs exist as commercial enterprises that must be profitable to survive. They must manage LTSS services as a way of finding that profit. Having care management done by a community-based agency makes that harder to do in some peoples minds, but it also resolves a lot of the dilemma about accountability so that the public can have confidence that this work is being done as well as possible. Community agencies will advocate for resources for clients, and MCOs can watch the community agencies and manage the budget if the states dont want to do it. I am much more comfortable with that model because while I am fine with the government getting out of the business of managing health payments as they dont want to keep up with the technology to do it well (a reality in many states), I dont think state Medicaid and aging services authorities should give up on assuring accountability in how these resources impact individuals. Nor do I think the federal government should let them. Everybody needs somebody watching what they do with the publics money. I think Rosalie would agree with me on this.LP:I think we know enough to see that Rosalies deep concerns about the HMO policy and practice black hole were well-founded as states hand off responsibility for policy and practice to corporate (insurance companies) entities managing their MLTSS programs. As Richard points out, this trend is not occurring in every state with Medicaid MLTC programs. For example, in Ohio, the area agencies on aging have been able to carve out a critical front-end role in the states MLTSS program, including an important care management role. In Wisconsin, the highly effective Medicaid MLTSS program is administered through the area agencies and county government agencies rather than through corporate HMOs. The general trend, however, in MLTSS states is toward the marginalizations of the nonprofit Aging Network in the administration of LTSS services. The Aging Networks role in LTSS is increasingly being reduced to community service programs funded through the Older American Act and state general revenue, which together constitute a small fraction of the state Medicaid funds. I think this is precisely the scenario Rosalie feared might occur with the spread of MLTSS programs across the states.RB/LP:What will happen in the long run? We think the issues discussed here are fundamental enough to have an influence on how things evolve. In the short run, governments, both state and federal, are so beset by problems and challenges of a budgetary and operational nature that it will take time for thinking to come around. The budgetary problems states will face already are becoming severe, and it will not take long for the Medicaid system to arrive at a funding crisis. This could lead some states to explore even more wholesale delegations of responsibility to private insurance companies. But, LTSS has never been particularly profitable, meaning the best reason for an MCO to be involved is to also be able to manage Medicare benefits to the beneficiaries. If government financial conditions become bad enough, they will turn to MCOs to limit costs, and make profitability harder. Many states have seen MCOs come and go. LTSS consumers remain. The challenge to avoid unnecessary institutionalization is a constant, and the key to effectiveness and efficiency is care management. Community-based agencies, like Area Agencies on Aging, have been there for almost fifty years and are fighting hard for the privilege of doing it. They dont require profitability.Rosalie would think that was a good thing.Richard Browdie is founder and principal at Browdie Consulting.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2024Remembering the Value of LegacyBy David J. EkerdtOctober 16, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingDuring the years in which I served on theGenerationsEditorial Advisory Board (19902012) and chaired it (19972001), single-themed issues of the journal were not so much assembled (as at a conventional journal) as curated. At in-person meetings of the board, members batted around potential topics for future issues. These might be updates about perennial matters in aging or aging services. Or they could be entirely new takes on the field that deserved readers attention. Critical to each proposed issue ofGenerationswould be a guest editor who could outline a solid and provocative issue and be able to recruit authors for specific articles.Topics that survived the winnowing and acquired a guest editor would then be reviewed with that editor at a subsequent meeting of the board. The guest editors proposal for the issue was aired out and the suggestions for tweaks flowed freely: perhaps more context for this topic, perhaps sharper policy implications, perhaps add a case description, perhaps so-and-so would be a great author for that article.When the gabfest had run its course, the guest editor departed the meeting accompanied by theGenerationseditorMary Johnson at that time. She would conduct the walk to the elevator whose purpose was to pass along this message: That was an energetic discussion! However, you need not heed all of our suggestions. Use your best judgement about the issue. We trust you.Her issue on legacy explored those things that we leave behind for our survivors: memories, estates, possessions, assets, meaning.The article that I prize from this period appeared in theFall 1996(Vol. 20, No. 3) issue: From Generation to Generation: Thoughts on Legacy. This was one of those innovative and interdisciplinary topics, and it was guest-edited by the formidable Rosalie Kane who, after her death in 2020, was credited by ASA for fierce creativity and independence of thought. Her issue on legacy explored those things that we leave behind for our survivors: memories, estates, possessions, assets, meaning.Cherished Possessions: The Meaning of Things by Sheldon S. Tobin was the article that I discovered in this issue. It went straight into my reprint file because at that time I was beginning a new line of research and wanted to ground myself in the literature on older adults and how they regard and manage their possessions. Here was a compact, authoritative review of research on the importance of cherished possessions as objects of reminiscence, as vessels for conveying our values and sense of self to others, and as a way to enhance the coherence of ones life story in the face of change.Distributing special things to others, the article noted, can often be perplexingthe very thing that I wanted to study. Written in that confident encyclopedia voice thatGenerationscoaxes from its authors, this article would become a cornerstone of my lit reviews.Shelly Tobin was likewise a formidable figure in our field. He had studied at the University of Chicago with the storied Committee on Human Development, whose scholars were contributing so much foundational thinking to aging and life-course studies. With Bernice Neugarten and Robert Havighurst, he was an author of the classic 1961 paper in gerontology, The Measurement of Life Satisfaction.To date, it has been cited nearly 5,000 times. Tobin became known for his writing about care in long-term settings and about the preservation of self in later life. As editor-in-chief ofThe Gerontologist, he encouraged me in my early career attempt to publish an essay in 1986 about the ubiquitous busy expectation of retirees. Shelly Tobin was important to the field and he was important to me.This single article about possessions was at once an instrument for my research, a link to the generative forces and personalities in gerontology, and is now an object of reminiscence about editorial board colleagues who enjoyed their work and one another. Peering intoGenerations, I am grateful for the knowledge and scholarship, but more, for the less expected gift of community.David J.

Kane, Guest EditorThe giving and receiving of legacies can evoke elemental emotions: hope, longing, fear, dread, anxiety, jealousy, bitterness, a sense of failure or of accomplishment, pride, contentment, joy, gratitude, humility, rage, love. Those planning legacies take stock of their accomplishments and disappointments, inventory their pos sessions, and reflect, with varying consciousness, on the people, work, ideas, commitments, and social institutions that have given their lives shape and meaning. One of the many euphemisms for dyingpassing onis also a term for transmission of material and immaterial legacies. The task of the deliberate legator is to determine what he or she wishes to pass on to others, and how he or she wishes to be remembered.Some people delay planning for intergenerational transfers via legacies, and others deal only erratically and incompletely with a subject that reminds them of their inevitable deaths. Others develop an almost obsessive preoccupation with their estates and distribution of their property. Perhaps this attention stems from a need to exert power (not by accident is it called a will , or perhaps from a desire to fulfill perceived obligations properly and fairly and to enable those they love to flourish. People may also act so as to be remembered with love and admiration.Some older people become engrossed in giving away their possessions in their lifetimes, perhaps situating valued objects with people expected to treasure them. Others go to great effort to swell the liquid value of estates by selling antiques, jewelry, and other collectibles rather than burdening heirs with those decisions (or trusting them to appreciate the monetary value of the items). Still others, perhaps while moving to a smaller living space, grieve the lack of people who crave their mementos.From a different perspective, those who expect or receive a legacy from someone important in their lives experience such a bequest as the last gift, praise, judgment, instruction, or rejection, culminating what may have been a long, complex relationship. Whether positive or negative, the message of a legacy given or withheld is all the more powerful because it literally was the last word.The need for a meaningful personal legacy and for lasting social guarantees.The challenge of planning thisGenerationsissue began with establishing the boundaries for the subject. Clearly, legacy includes last wills and testaments and their implications. But the subject also could be construed broadly to focus on how people want to be remembered. In that latter sense, people can deliberately shape their legacies; public figures may consciously try to shape the way history will see them, and many people prepare family histories for the following generations. However, one's legacy, in the sense of how one will be remembered, is largely out of one's own control. History renders the verdict, which may be reevaluated over time. Thus, we speak of the legacy of various leaders and scholars now dead, and similarly of the legacy of our acquaintances in terms of enduring ideas, values, and images that their memory evokes.With the exception of the steady stream of work on life review, personal identity and meaning in later years, and reminiscence, which all relate to intangible legacies, legacy is barely treated in aging studies. Most of us approach the subject of legacy personallyfrom our store of experiences and anecdotes, with images derived as much from novels, films, and religious traditions as from a body of research or theory. Indeed, many of the authors in this issue draw from personal recollections and from general writings, including mythology, the Bible, popular literature, and history.Medicaid and LegacyMy professional interest in legacy was initially sparked by a circumscribed public policy topic, which I have dubbed the legacy legitimation crisis. In a nutshell, the question is: To what extent should those receiving public subsidy for long-term-care (LTC) expenses through Medicaid be permitted to conserve resources to pass on to heirs after they themselves pass on? Should those who have relied on Medicaid for their LTC even expect to leave a material legacy?In the United States, LTC expenditures are viewed as goods to be purchased out of private income (other examples are housing, clothing, and food) rather than as goods to be fully or partly purchased for all citizens out of tax dollars (like, for example, primary and secondary education, defense, roads, and, for elderly people, hospital care and physician services). LTC falls under the so-called safety net provisions (that is, the set of policies that provide a minimum package of public benefits for poor people only) rather than under universal entitlements (that is, benefits that would be made available to citizens regardless of their financial status). Thus, tax dollars can be used to help finance nursing home care (and indeed are so used to the tune of billions of dollars), but only to benefit those too poor to foot their own bills. Moreover, in keeping with the safety net philosophy, the standard of public provision is kept low. Beyond the needed healthcare, the safety net for the resident on Medicaid offers meals, sleeping space in a double room, and a minimal personal-needs allowance. Basic care and sustenance are provided, but not at the level whereby the older person could afford, say, a television, telephone, or private room.Nursing home care has become extraordinarily expensive, capable of wiping out substantial savings in a matter of months. Although almost all elderly nursing home residents are guaranteed an income (through Social Security, a universal benefit), this income is insufficient to meet nursing home costs, and those without other substantial sources of income must revert to Medicaid. Alarmed about public LTC expenditures, presently largely in nursing homes, some public officials and state legislators speculate that many elderly people have given away their wealth prior to entering a nursing home (known as \"divestment\") so that they can immediately benefit by Medicaid.People cannot simply give away their money, apply for Medicaid, and enter a nursing home on the same day. Federal and state rules render such a plan impossible. Indeed, if the nursing home resident has transferred any assets within three years with the intent of becoming eligible for nursing home care, he or she is dubbed ineligible for Medicaid coverage. The notion is that the money thus divested must be somewhere, and the premature inheritors should use it to pay for the care. And people who divest assets ahead of time in a longrange plan to become eligible for Medicaid coverage of nursing homes take considerable risk. Essentially, they become financially dependent, not a step to be taken lightly.Recently public policy makers have turned renewed attention to the family home, which is not counted as an asset when Medicaid eligibility is calculated if the older person in a nursing home has any chance of returning to it or if a spouse, minor child, or child with a disability is living in it. Such homes could be worth substantial sums, which the state could collect after the death of the nursing home resident and, when applicable, other occupants. States have long had such laws on the books, but have enforced chem weakly and haphazardly. Since 1993, however, federal law has required states to actively claim the homes of deceased nursing home residents-a process called estate recovery.Divestment, Medicaid eligibility policies, and estate recovery policies have become incendiary topics, polarized and engendering passionate rhetoric. On one side, advocates tell heart-wrenching tales of older people with disabilities who are stripped of their life savings, pauperized and stigmatized, forced into the indignities of life on Medicaid in a nursing home with incomes of less than $60 a month (what some states allow for personal expenditures for Medicaid recipients) to negotiate lifes exigencies. This is hardly enough for greeting cards and toiletries; certainly not enough to finance a cab ride and a movie or concert or baseball gameand surely an unfitting reward for a person who, perhaps mindful of Aesops fable about the grasshopper and ant, labored hard for a lifetime and saved frugally. This view also depicts anguished relatives, struggling with college tuition for their children, or, more likely, given the advanced age of most nursing home residents, struggling with their own retirement needs and their competing wishes to help their adult children or even their grandchildren buy homes and finance postsecondary educations.On the other side, proponents of tightening up Medicaid contemptuously depict greedy seniors who divest or sequester resources to qualify for Medicaid, distorting the intent of the benefit and draining funds from truly needy people. Longman (1995) refers to them as pretend paupers and excoriates the elder-law attorneys who assist them in developing long-range, lawful strategies to position themselves to use Medicaid for LTC funding. He quotes a state Medicaid director as saying: We now have a cottage industry in this state of attorneys who encourage their clients to avoid their responsibilities. Spokespeople for LTC insurance especially argue in favor of clamping down on what they consider easy middle-class welfare payments for nursing home residents. Why should anyone buy apples if they are being given away across the street? And why should anyone pay premiums for LTC insurance if they can become eligible for the benefits by divestment when the time comes?Rebuttals point out that LTC insurance is beyond the purse of most people, that the insurance products are problematic, and that nursing homes (to imitate the politically popular phrase about welfare in the 1996 election year) as we know them are a dreaded end-point for those who have worked and saved and supported family and country over a lifetime.Why is this topic so controversial? Why does an elderly Medicaid recipient in a nursing home conjure up such diverse images: an exploited, powerless individual whose life has been robbed of meaning versus a free rider who exploits fellow citizens and public coffers for the benefit of heirs? Why does the subject strike such a deep vein of feeling, which is evidenced by the astounding attack and counterattack rhetoric assembled in a remarkable law review article by Jan Ellen Rein (1996)?As I have suggested elsewhere (1995), the debate is so controversial because it strikes squarely at an area of public policy that has been characterized by ambivalence, ambiguity, and animosity: chat is, the desirable mix of universal entitlements and meanstested programs in the United States. The debate is also controversial because authorities disagree on the faces-whether stricter eligibility procedures, estate recovery practices, and perhaps relative-responsibility laws would represent budgetary salvation or the proverbial blood from a scone; if the latter, these efforts are not worth their cost or the loss of social solidarity. And, whether real or mythical,rareor ubiquitous, once wealthy older people in nursing homes at public expense (and the lawyers representing chem) have become scapegoats for the ills of a society experiencing budget crunches and deeply resenting taxation.Legacy in Broad ContextThe issue at the Medicaid-legacy nexus, which was sketched out above, is particular to federalism and health care policy in the United States at the end of the twentieth century. Yet further exploration requires a much more general look at the topic of legacy. Why does it feel right to me that governments subsidize LTC rather than ask older people to deplete their savings to pay for a final year or so in a nursing home? Why does it seem tragic that these same people must live as paupers?To help inform the public policy debate, we need to explore why industrial societies, specifically the United States, cake as a given the right of people co direct their resources after their death. What, if any, proper societal purposes are achieved by such rights? What curbs, if any,shouldbe placed on unrestricted individual decision-makingfor example, in the form of laws requiring particular distributions or prohibiting ochers? What legitimate interests does the body politic have in taxing legacies? Should legacy policies be reconsidered in the light of current economic realities and lengthened life expectancy? We also need to explore the meaning of legacy co individuals. Why do older people themselves avoid accepting help for financing LTC, including community-based care, if the condition is that they must apply for Medicaid and abandon the notion of bequeathing their home? Is leaving some tangible legacy so important, and, if so, why? Information and analysis are not readily available to answer these broader questions. For example, one looks in vain for contemporary philosophical, ethical, or political analyses about the social utility of inheritances and legacies.The rest of this issue ofGenerationsis organized into three sections, followed by my concluding thoughts about the future agenda on legacy.Macro-PerspectivesSection one of this issue, Legal, Moral, and Policy Perspectives, explores the uncharted territory of legacy using one of the strengths of gerontology: a genuinely multidisciplinary approach and a respect for wisdom derived from practice and daily human experience. In the lead article, Lawrence Frolik summarizes the law in the United States about bequeathing material possessions, co gently describing what can and can not be done, the legal vehicles available, and the principles by which an individual might decide on distributing an estate. Next Colleen O'Connor, also an attorney, reviews the sketchy empirical evidence about legacies and inheritances, an elusive topic co study. Sarah-Vaughan Brakman, a philosopher, follows with a careful analysis of whether, from a moral perspective, an older person owes a legacy to offspring and, if so, why. Then, Rose Dobrof and Harry Moody address the fascinating issue of philanthropy. As an alternative or an adjunct to leaving wealth to family and friends, another option is to establish charitable legacies. Health and human services organizations and universities have long been beneficiaries of such largesse, which is used on behalf of people and causes that many deem important (e.g., healing the sick, protecting the old and vulnerable, giving opportunity to talented students, nourishing the spirit through the arcs). Yet little attention has been devoted co studying chis charitable impulse philosophically, sociologically, or psychologically. Next Stephen Sapp discusses how the most dominant religious traditions in the United States (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) view the giving and receiving of legacies, and how these views are incorporated into a larger frame work of the responsibilities of children to parents, parents to children, and members of communities to each other.The last two articles in section one move toward the political. Joanna Weinberg explores a different side of legacy: the legacy inherent in the social compact by which resources are redistributed across individuals and generations (usually through tax dol lars) to underwrite certain social guarantees. These expected legacies may include clean air and water, safe streets, and schools and universities where the accumulated wisdom of ages is stored and can be tapped by successive generations. They may also include a cushion against lifes vicissitudesa guaranteed minimal income, healthcare, or even long-term care. Weinberg points to the links be tween personal legacyin other words, what people are allowed to ac cumulate and disperse privately in their lives and after their deaths-and the extent of the societal legacy that the community can provide.Section one concludes with an article by William Crown, who examines a relatively narrow but fascinating aspect of this relationship: how state policies on estate taxes can be counterproductive if they lead to reduced income tax because residents change their state of primary residence. His work highlights the difficulties of developing an alignment of benefits, tax obligations, and incentives in a federal system, a topical thought given the trend of the mid-199os to further the devolution of welfare policies and programs to the state level.Legacy and MeaningUsing insights from social, psychological, and anthropological research, clinical practice, and creative literature, the articles in section two, Legacy and Meaning, explore various aspects of the importance of legacies (tangible or intangible, of great monetary value or no monetary value) in the lives of people. Sheldon Tobin discusses cherished possessions and the meaning they hold, not only for younger people who may have inherited them, but for elderly people who treasure objects that they too perceive as legacies-reminders of people and times gone by. Helen Kivnick, a lifespan psychologist, describes the legacies older people create in imparting wisdom gained over a lifetime to successive generations. She points out that for such a legacy in the form of story and precept to be realized, both a teller and a listener are needed; a contemporary tragedy might be the dearth of willing listeners. Wendy Lustbader takes another important tack, pointing out that, willy-nilly, the subject of legacy involves the wielding of power, perhaps necessary but often psychologically potent. She notes the deep hurt that occurs among siblings who interpret testamentary arrangements as rejection, and she makes practical suggestions on how such pain might be averted.Much thinking about legacy deals with direct family lines. Robert Rubenstein describes a particularly difficult case of legacyhow those who never had children or have no surviving children create a meaningful legacy, tangible or otherwise. In contrast, Norah Keating describes a different predicamentthat of the owner of a valuable family farm who has an embarrassment of possible heirs for an asset that is not readily divisible. Besides, the aging farmer may be unready to turn over that farm when one or more possible heirs are ready to manage it. Referring to the Prince Charles syndrome, Keating raises a theme that is relevant more generally: that is, with increasing life expectancies, perhaps our notions of legacy after death need to be reshaped into discussions about transfers made during one's lifetime. Certainly gerontologists have long been aware that such transfers occur and that they more often flow from older to younger than the other way around.Finally, Anne Wyatt-Brown, literary scholar and gerontologist, invites us into the realm of English-language novels co explore the way legacy has been approached in selected nineteenth- and twentieth-century works. Surely it is no accident that the perpetuation of legacies through wills and other arrangements is the staple of fine literature, as well as of popular culture (e.g., family saga novels, television and movie dramas, mystery fiction). Wyatt-Brown shows us that the insights of fiction writers can vastly expand a topic by putting it in historical and geographic context and, more important, articulating psychological insights. To take just one of her many examples, her analysis of George Eliot's novel Middlemarch evokes the thought that a legacy of ill-gotten origin perhaps should be rejected.Divestment and Estate Recovery PoliciesSection three, Divestment and Estate Recovery Policies, turns to the current policy issue on Medicaid eligibility and legacy that piqued my interest in the first place. Scott Severns, an elder-law attorney, describes the view from his office, where his clients must struggle with their own individual requirements (often idiosyncratic) for personal security, their perceived familial obligations, and their plans for their own old age. Joshua Wiener, an economist who has empirically modeled the affordability of LTC insurance, discusses what is at stake financially: that is, the incomes and assets of older people and the likely amounts to be recovered by stricter policies more strictly applied to make sure people pay for their own care, or that their families do. Brian Burwell and William Crown describe federal and state policies related to Medicaid eligibility and empirical data about their application in selected states. Erica Wood and Charles Sabatino similarly describe federal and state policies on Medicaid estate recovery, which, they argue, are patently unfair in that they mainly affect those who have least. Finally, Mary Olsen Baker presents and discusses four cases, each of which highlights complex ethical issues that arise in trying to apply current policies fairly across older people and across generations.If readers move through the articles in sequence, the public policy issues treated in section three will no longer seem cut-and-dried or obvious. The subject strikes at a very human need for meaningful personal legacy and an enduring societal need for lasting social guarantees, both of which must flow, in the words of the Hebrew scriptures, from generation to generation.ReferencesKane, R.

TobinThe frail, gnarled woman in her nineties takes out a snapshot taken at least 50 years ago and says, Thats me in this picture, but I may have changed a little bit. The young interviewer is at first confused but then realizes that the purpose of the photo is to convey a sense of the selfimmutable in the here-and-now (Tobin, 1991).Sherman and Newman (197778), in the first study that focused on cherished possessions of the elderly, found photos to be the most cherished. Later, Csikszentmihalyi and RochbergHalton (1981) in their book The Meaning of Things reported that photos were grandparents highest-ranked special objects in a three-generational study. The grandparents contrasted with parents, who ranked furniture highest, and children, who ranked stereos highest. Similarly, Wapner, Demick, and Redondo (1990) reported on the importance of photos as cherished objects of nursing home residents, and Sherman (1991) reported on the use of photos and other memorabilia as reminiscentiainducers of memory. The other memorabilia in these reports are religious artifacts, jewelry, and consumer items such as visual art and recreational objects.The meaningfulness of the possessions elderly people identify as cherished resides in their legacy. As people change over time, concrete objects that do not change are kept for their personal meanings. Elderly individuals must choose from a lifetime of objects, those possessions they wish to save for themselves, as a kind of bequest to themselves. These possessions are, therefore, connections to a person's own historical past. Csikszentmialyi and Rochberg-Halton (1981) wrote that for an adult, objects serve the purpose of maintaining the continuity of the self as it expands through time. The importance of cherished possessions for such continuity among the elderly is nowhere more evident than in relocations to longterm-care facilities because, when possessions are left behind, a de-selfing process ensues (Golfman, 1961).Kamptner (1989) noted that diverse personal possessions may assist individuals in maintaining and preserving their identities in the face of events that erode their sense of self ... and they may represent ties or bonds with others at a time of life when social losses tend to be greatest (p. 182). An elderly Jewish widow said, I still keep my husband's tallis (prayer shawl) as if he will come through the door and run off with it to shull to daven (to synagogue to pray). This comment captures the essence of a cherished possessiona possession for which there is a special fondness. In turn, the special fondness is from the evocation of memories that are meaningful. When a husband of half a century has died, possessions that are reminders of him can indeed be comforting and also assuring of a sense of continuity of the self. These possessions are kept and cherished precisely because of their meaningfulness for one's personal identity.The Deceased Among UsThe specific memories of a deceased person evoked by these cherished objects, however, need not be accurate to affirm the persistence of identity. More important is the objects capacity to facilitate memories of a specialness in the relationship to the deceased person and to enhance the coherence of one's life story as the personal narrative is written and rewritten to preserve identity in the face of change. Often in this process of providing meaning to the evoked memory, the deceased husband, for example, becomes idealized. Lopata (1979) has referred to this idealization as sanctification. By sanctifying husbands, widows enhance their own sense of worthiness and selfesteem, while also dramatizing the past. Revere and Tobin (198081) found that when reconstructing reminiscences older people do indeed dramatize the past more than middleaged people do. Deceased parents, as well as spouses, become bigger than life, usually quite heroic but sometimes more cruel than is to be believed. In dramatizing the past and imbuing the deceased with sometimes mythical proportions, the older person becomes vivid to herself or himself, helping to assure the preservation of the self.As people change over time, concrete objects that do not change are kept for their personal significance.Using the past to preserve the self, but not living in the past, is also evident when widows talk to photos of deceased husbands. A student asked if an elderly widow she was assigned to counsel was psychotic because she talked to her dead husband: Every night she looks at his picture and talks to him as if he were in the room. This behavior is rarely a symptom of psychosis, but it always reflects a process of retaining continuity and coherence of the self. Photos are not the only cherished possessions that can evoke vivid and lifelike memories of deceased people: That picture, the oil painting of flowers on that wall, was painted by my wife. Whenever I look at it, I can still see her standing at her easel by her garden. She had a way of standing while painting that I shall never forget. Sometimes it makes me tearful.Recollected people are not, however, restricted to spouses and parents. The recollected person may be a grandparent or even an earlier ancestor: This cupboard goes way back. I don't know how many generations. Possessions from previous generations provide a sense of coherence and embeddedness in family. So too do possessions that serve as triggers to remembrances of the continuity of generations: See the seashells over there. My daughter, when she was little and we went on vacation, would collect them with me. I loved walking with her on the sandy beach, just like I used to do with my mother. The diverse kinds of cherished possessionsphotos, religious items, jewelry, furniture, visual art, and otherscan have meanings that span past and future generations: That's a favorite picture of mine. It shows when my mother and wife were alive and my daughter, the little one, got married.Religious items seem especially useful for spanning the generations. Bibles, prayer books, crucifixes, and menorahs are likely to have been handed down and will, in turn, be handed to further generations. These objects also have a special function because of the importance of religious beliefs among the very old. A belief that to live beyond four score and ten is one of Gods blessings for service can indeed be comforting. So too can a belief in a hereafter that contains not only meeting ones Maker but also reunions with deceased loved ones. Photos, therefore, of the deceased serve not only as reminders of a past life that reaffirms the present identity but also can be reminders of a future that will contain a reunion with these loved ones.Spanning the generations suggests the experience of a family history, of a continuity with previous generations. Sometimes the cherished possession is a reminder of a parent who inherited the possession, whereas at other times, the possession comes with a story: This is my genealogy. She began describing who she is by handing me a heavy volume filled with genealogical charts. The inscriptions and the interesting stories they told went back to the days of the Mayflower and then through Jamestown and other places that I only know from history books. The meaning, however, always became refocused on her mother: She was always interested in American history. And It was like she personally knew everyone written in our past. Because this respondent, like her mother before her, is a Daughter of the American Revolution, the memory of her mother is inextricably woven into the fabric of her reminders of early American history. The same importance is ascribed to objects owned by ancestors not personally known but passed down through parents and other close family membersfor example, genealogical records; photos, religious artifacts, furniture, or art work. From this psychological perspective, inherited cherished possessions passed down from long-dead ancestors possess their meaning through parents and other close family members with whom there has been significant intimacy.Passing on Cherished PossessionsSometimes the most cherished of possessions has an idiosyncratic meaning that limits its value to others. A lonely 83-year-old woman who has been widowed for twenty-two years has a shrine in the living room for her dog Rufus, who died eight months ago and whom she raised from a puppy. A leash hangs from the shrine, and as she talks, she glances over to the shrine and says, \"Whenever I feel lonely, I stroke the leash. I'm looking forward to seeing Rufus again. The leash could not possibly have a similar meaning to anyone else.Yet there are many possessions that have shared meanings. The octogenarian said, This is a childrens broach that I inherited from my grandmother. I'm not sure who to give it to. My Lisa, shes my favorite grandchild, is going to have a baby. If it's a girl she should have it. This legacy spans six generations: from a grandparent to the speaker and from the speaker to a great granddaughter.What to give to whomand whencan often be perplexing. Some possessions arc bequeathed, to be given after death, whereas others arc given during ones lifetime, at confirmations, bar mitzvahs, or weddings. When relocating to a smaller home after adult children have moved, there is a stripping-down of possessions and a likelihood of passing some cherished possessions to children. Usually, difficult choices must be made by families regarding what should be given to children at this time and what should be kept after the move to a smaller home. Women are likely to be particularly concerned about the loss of furniture because of the future shortage of space. Men, in turn, may be concerned about adequate space for possessions associated with work and recreation. It is as death approaches in advanced old age, that a final sortingout occurs and determinations are made regarding who gets what.As people live longer, however, and are progenitors of four- and five-generation families, giving may be to children for distribution co their lineage. Troll (1994), for example, found that among respondents 85 years of age and over, closeness was with their children, and they often did not have a direct connection with grandchildren. She noted regarding these relationships chat most of these very old peoples relationships with grandchildren seemed to be spillovers from their closeness to their children. Particularistic relationships could exist with one grandchild and not another (p. 57). Children were more likely to be referred to by name, whereas grandchildren are referred to as my grandchildren or my son's children. One 89-ycar-old widow said, Money I'll divide between my three sons, but the jewelry and art, I dont know. I dont know what all my grandchildren would appreciate. This woman has viable heirs, but apparently many of the very old do not. Whereas 95 percent of the sample that Troll studied had living relatives, almost onefourth had no interaction with any of them or just exchanged Christmas cards and/or an annual phone call (p. 54). Still, for these apparent heirless oldest-old people, cherished possessions serve as legacies to themselves, as objects for reminiscences chat preserve the continuity of the self.Sheldon S.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2024Medicare Has Sustainability Issues: Who Could Have Guessed?By Marshall B. KappOctober 16, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingThe Medicare program has been a major boon to the United States national well-being since its enactment in 1965, resulting in enormously improved access to high-quality, affordable health care for many millions of older and disabled Americans. But these benefits of Medicare have been achieved only through the expenditure of vast financial resources. Today, Medicares precarious long-range economic viability is well-documented, and disturbing projections about the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) trust funds near-term demise abound from reputable sources including the Congressional Budget Office and the Annual Reports of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Funds.Who in the past could possibly have foreseen Medicares present financial unsustainability? If we had only been prescient enough to anticipate this situation, surely we would have taken timely, reasonable, and equitable legislative and regulatory action to protect the program and its beneficiaries in an orderly and pain-minimizing fashion!Of course, I am being rhetorical here. No crystal ball was necessary, just an objective appraisal of the healthcare financing landscape. Many astute health policy activists and commentatorsdidforesee the inevitably approaching Medicare funding danger and honestly acknowledged it several decades ago, not to mention multiple Congresses and Presidential Administrations.We were duly warned almost 30 years ago.For evidence of such foresight, one need look no further than theSummer 1996 issue (Vol. 20, No. 2)ofGenerations. Guest-edited by national health policy icon Ed Howard, the issue theme was Where Is Healthcare Headed? and it contained several contributions urging policy and practice reforms of the Medicare program before crisis mode would take hold. The most prominent analyses of the inevitable fiscal dilemma were Howards introductory essay, A Look at the New, Improved (?) American Healthcare System, and Rethinking Medicare, by economist Judith R. Lave, one-time director of the Office of Research at the Health Care Financing Administration (predecessor agency of todays CMS).The Lave piece asserted the truth (in 1996 and as well in 2024) that, In the long term, there will need to be a fundamental reevaluation of the nature of the contract between the federal government and its older citizens. But in the meantime, Lave described a number of modest specific, realistically actionable alterations aimed at buttressing the Medicare programs future financial security, while continuing to fulfill its central policy goal concerning meaningful healthcare coverage for the programs beneficiary population.Quite unfortunately, in the intervening years between the Summer 1996Generationsissue and the present, national lawmakers have for the most part willfully ignored Laves structural recommendations and those of other commentators anxious about Medicares future financial capacity.Instead, the forecast for long-term solvency has steadily, and predictably, declined over time. With only a few brave exceptions who were willing to touch the metaphorical third rail of electoral survival, office holders and candidates at the highest levels of both major political parties have weaponized the topic of even the most incremental Medicare reform ideas. Supposed policy leaders have figured out how to demonize opponents who can be made vulnerable to accusations of cutting benefits because they may have shown an openness to even listening to possible deviations from existing Medicare program details, when options are tinged however softly with any hint of fiscal responsibility.We were duly warned almost 30 years ago. Another quarter-century hence, will a futureGenerationsissue be celebrating an ongoing Medicare program made robust by the design and implementation of necessary, timely structural changes, or will authors be lamenting the demise of a great program relic that eventually could not survive the proclivities of feckless political leaders who would not remove their heads from the sand and act, reluctantly but soberly?Marshall B.

Rethinking Medicare.Generations, 20(2), 1923.https://www.jstor.org/stable/44877347A Look at the New, Improved (?) American Healthcare SystemBy Ed HowardThe editorial board ofGenerationsfirst approached me early in 1995 to discuss devoting an issue to a look into the future of our healthcare system, in light of what we all thought were the soon-to-be-enacted sweeping changes in Medicare and Medicaidthe healthcare programs most important to older people, their families and advocates.Over the preceding two years, a combination of interest group opposition, tactical errors by proponents, and preferences for incremental change among the American public had doomed the comprehensive health reform plans put forth by President Clinton and Democrats in Congress, eroding what one prominent commentator called the aura of inevitability that major national reform would be enacted (Lundberg, 1993).Then the tidal wave of electoral change swept through the land in November 1994, putting conservative Republican majorities in control of both houses of Congress. The Contract with America, endorsed by most Republican House candidates, contained not a word about health. But one of its central premises was that the federal budget must be balanced, by constitutional amendment if necessary.Coupled with Republican promises to seek major reductions in taxes and a major buildup in defense spending, and what both parties conceded was the political inviolability of the Social Security program, this agenda guaranteed that Medicare and Medicaid would be targeted for major savings. Once one takes Social Security, interest on the debt, and defense spending off the table, Medicare and Medicaid constitute two-fifths of what is left (Congressional Budget Office, 1996). If a balanced budget is your goal, you can't get there from here unless Medicare and Medicaid are a major part of the plan. And since the Clinton healthcare plan had itself envisioned substantial cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid growth as a means of financing broader coverage, a different aura of inevitability began to become visible.Thus the plan was to use this issue of Generations to take stock of the major changes in the major federal health programs, and to look down the road at the implications for both older people and for the healthcare system in general.Indeed, last year the new Republican majorities in both the House and the Seriate did pass a blueprint for achieving a balanced federal budget by the year 2002. And to achieve that goal, they called for reductions in Medicare and Medicaid of some $430470 billion over seven years. These were not cuts, Republicans reminded everyone, but reductions in the rate of growth. Adding to the climate for change was the report of the Medicare trustees in April 1995, which predicted that the Hospital Insurance trust fund of Medicare would reach zero balance\"go bankruptin 2002.Consolidations, mergers and acquisitions, for-profit conversions, and, above all else, the steady (if mutating) march of managed carehow do Medicare and Medicaid fit into the fast-evolving healthcare system?Pledging that their budget plans would protect, preserve, and strengthen Medicare, Republicans pressed their spending reduction plan.Over the course of the summer and fall, negotiations and re-estimates lowered the proposed Medicare and Medicaid cutbacks from $270 billion over seven years to about $250 billion.Still, invoking the need to protect these health programs and those who depend on them, President Clinton vetoed the legislation that came from the budget blueprint. The veto stood.Medicare and Medicaid not only were not scaled back, but the impasse between congressional Republicans and the administration meant that even agreed-upon steps were not taken. Thus, provider reimbursements were not shaved by a percentage point or two as in most recent years, and the monthly Part B premium paid by beneficiaries actually went down by $3.60 in January 1996.All of this change in our expectation of change has meant recalibration of the tone and content of the healthcare debate. But it seems clear to me that the genie is out of the bottle; the partisan clash of 1995 has triggered a serious debate not only over the future of Medicare and Medicaid, but over our vision of how those programs fit into our fast-evolving healthcare system.And it is by now a clich to say that the private sector is reforming itselfconsolidations, mergers and acquisitions, for-profit conversions, and, above all else, the steady (if mutating) march of managed care. Whether or not Congress can muster the strength to pass a simple insurance reform measureand at this writing such modest action looks more and more doubtfulthe winds of change are clearly whistling.Just as Medicare was designed long ago to echo the structure of coverage common to the under-65 population, it assuredly will be reshaped in ways that make it more closely resemble the starkly different structure of coverage today. And Americas governors are intent on changing the nature of the Medicaid program in order to better control its costs to their states.The authors who have contributed articles to this issue have done their job magnificently. These articles provide invaluable insight into what makes the current system tickits strengths and weaknesses, who profits and who suffers. And though there are few attempts to envision the healthcare system of the twenty-first century, I believe our authors capture most of the trends at work that will shape that system. I am honored to have the chance to make a contribution to their good work. The major issues still undecided are identified and debated vigorously. Here are just a few:Fewer than one in ten Medicare beneficiaries is enrolled in a health maintenance organization. How will the growth of HMOs and other forms of managed care affect older people and all of the rest of us? And what kinds of consumer protections need to be developed?Managed care figures prominently in concerns over Medicaid as well. Most states are acting swiftly to herd mothers and children, who constitute three-fourths of Medicaid beneficiaries, into HMOs. How feasible is it to move frail older and disabled people, on whose care 60 percent of Medicaid money is spent, into managed care arrangements?Quality and cost are central to the evolution of the private system and public policy. You will find in this issue provocative examinations of our search for quality and of the real causes of healthcare cost escalation. We often equate higher quality with higher technology, and the link between high technology and high cost is unmistakable.And one overarching theme will be played out in many issue areas: How prominent should the role of government be in paying for or regulating care?As you will find in the excellent guide to public opinion in this issue, American attitudes toward healthcare are sometimes ill informed and always difficult to discern. No substantial movement toward quality, affordable healthcare and long-term care for all Americans is likely before we all come to grips with the difficult trade-offs this topic presents.It is almost an article of faith among some analysts that our countrys pace of spending on healthcare cannot be sustained. Much of what needs to be done over the next period is to get better value for our healthcare dollar. But that does not mean we have decided how much is the right amount to spend on healthcare. And to say that we cannot afford to extend coverage to those without itand I mean longterm care as well as acute careis to fly in the face of fact. Whether we choose to act is quite another question, and the real one.ReferencesLundberg, G.

The Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 19972006 (May) pp. 42, 46. Washington, D.C.Rethinking MedicareBy Judith R. LaveIn 1995, the Congress passed the Medicare Preservation Act, which proposed major changes the Medicare One justification for this act, which was vetoed by the president, was a call for action by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Health Insurance Trust Fund, which oversees Medicare, urging Congress to begin a careful evaluation of the program because the trust fund faced significant financial problems in both the short and the long term (Board of Trustees, 1995). Such urging is not rare. For instance, in 1991 I chaired a health technical panel for the 1991 Advisory Council on Social Security that reached the following conclusion: the current state of the Medicare program is precarious, and the status quo cannot be maintained. . . . policy makers will have to make a number of difficult choices about how to bring the Hi Trust Fund into balance and how to control the increasing costs of the SMI program (Advisory Council on Social Security, 1991).In fact, ever since the implementation of Medicare, the research and pol- icy community has not been reluctant to recommend changes in the program. The professional journals have been filled with recommendationsboth large and small. For instance, among the many suggested changes in benefits are the following: (1) to expand Medicare by adding long-term-care benefits and prescription drugs, (2) to restructure the cost-sharing pro- visions under fee-for-service and in clude a limit on out- of-pocket payments, or even (3) to change Medicare from a defined benefit to a defined contribution (voucher) program. In other words, people have been \"re-thinking\" Medicare since its inception. The purpose of this paper is to consider what types of changes the Medicare program should undergo in the near term. First is a brief discussion of some of Medicare s successes; second, some of the major problems; and last, issues related to the restructuring and financing of the Medicare program.Medicare's SuccessesMedicare has been a successful program in many respects. It dramatically increased access to high-quality medical care for Americas older people. It has facilitated the development and spread of modern medical techniques and technology in such areas as cardiac surgery, ophthalmology, and prosthesis and joint replacement that have contributed to the quality and length of life. Furthermore, under Medicare, most older people are treated equally; that is, providers receive the same payments for providing a specific service to the rich or the poor. As a group, Medicare beneficiaries are more satisfied with their health plan than are other large identified groups (employed people, Medicaid recipients, unemployed people) (Davis, 1995). Finally, the program has relatively low administrative costs compared to private sector insurance programs.Medicare's ProblemsA number of problems are also associated with Medicare and have resulted in calls for change. The principal factor precipitating congressional proposals to change Medicare is cost. At the present time, Hospital Insurance (HI) disbursements exceed revenues (primarily payroll taxes) and, unless changes are made, the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be bankrupt by 2002. Furthermore, the in- crease in the costs of the Supplementary Insurance program (SMI), which is funded through general revenues and beneficiary premiums, is not sustainable. In 1995, the Medicare program consumed 13 percent of the federal budget; by 2000, according to projections, it will consume 16 percent. The long-term financial issues are even more pressing. As the baby boom generation begins to retire in 2010, the number of workers relative to retirees will decrease significantly.The main factor driving the increase in Medicare cost has been technological change (Newhouse, 1992), which will no doubt continue to be a major force (Aaron, 1995). Still, several features of the Medicare program itself have contributed to inefficiencies in the provision of healthcare services and to the increase in Medicare outlays.First, the structure of the program, with its distinction between HI (primarily inpatient) and SMI (primarily outpatient) services is a relica holdover from the healthcare system of the 1960s. The Medicare program is designed to cover short-term acute care services or acute exacerbations of chronic conditions, thus many preventive services and long-term-care services are not covered. (Even so, in recent years a major factor contributing to cost increases has been the rapid expansion in long- term-care servicesspecifically home health services and nursing home care [Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, 1995].) What is more, the cost-sharing provisions, which could be seen as a major tool for reshaping healthcare utilization patterns into a more efficient and cost-effective form, are ineffective. The SMI deductible is too low, the skilled nursing facility co-insurance is too high, the episode of illness concept is obsolete, and there is no limit on beneficiary liability. The majority of Medicare beneficiaries have Medigap policies, so, while the cost-sharing provisions have an impact on the allocation of the costs of Medicare-covered services between the government and the beneficiaries, these provisions are unlikely to have any significant impact on the utilization of healthcare services.How relevant is the experience of the private employed sector to the Medicare population?Rather than controlling costs by changing utilization patterns, Medicare uses price controls as its prime cost-containment instrument. And, because the American healthcare system itself is fluid, with little government control over growth in the number and variety of service providers or settings in which services are provided, there is continuous pressure to expand the types of providers, settings, and services covered under Medicare. While the Medicare program has been innovative, its administrators at the Health Care Financing Administration have not been handed the tools to manage the fee-for-service program efficiently. To contain costs, Medicare has implemented a fee schedule for physicians, a prospective payment system for hospitals, and payment limits for nursing home and home health services. While these payment systems are improvements over the ones they replaced, they are incomplete control mechanisms, since they do not control volume of use. Increases in use, particularly in home health and skilled nursing home services as noted above, have been a major factor contributing to the growth in Medicare costs. In addition, since Medicare prices have sometimes been set below the cost of care, the result has been some shifting of costs from the Medicare program to the private sector (Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, 1995).As an alternative to the traditional fee-for-service system, the Congress has implemented the Medicare risk program, which pays for beneficiaries who enroll in health maintenance organizations. The number of beneficiaries enrolling in HMOs has been increasing rapidly. By 1995, 2.9 million, or 8 percent of beneficiaries, were enrolled in some kind of risk program. However, the structure of the Medicare risk program has many problems (Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, 1995; Physician Payment Review Commission, 1996). The method that Medicare uses to pay HMOs is deeply flawed. Most (e.g., Physician Payment Review Commission, 1996; Brown et al., 1993), although not all (Rogers and Smith, 1996), believe that there is biased se- lection into HMOs; that is, that the HMO beneficiaries are healthier than the Medicare population in general. In this case, payment rates to HMOs are seen as too high and the risk program is seen as more costly to Medicare than the fee-for-service system. Medicare beneficiaries receive relatively little information about the HMOs they could join from the Health Care Financing Administration or other public organizations. Furthermore, the program is designed so that most savings result in new health benefits for HMO enrollees rather than in savings to Medicare.The current structure of the Medicare program is inconsistent with the restructuring of the healthcare system that is taking place for younger people. As the economist Henry Aaron (1995) described it in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee: Most working Americans and the healthcare providers who serve them are experiencing revolutionary changes in the organization of healthcare financing arrangements and the delivery of healthcare services. Managed Care in its countless manifestations is forcing individuals into health arrangements in which the third parties oversee, supervise and manage the traditional direct relationships between providers and patients. These new systems are designed to encourage providers to act efficiently and to provide incentives for the insured to select low-cost plans (ideally, those in which providers are acting efficiently).Some Modest ProposalsTwo years ago, this country was in the middle of a debate over healthcare reform. There was considerable discussion about how to extend access to health insurance to all Americans. Now, there seems to be little public interest in extending access. Furthermore, current commitments to disadvantaged members of the society are being threatened. Consequently, it is difficult to propose a rethinking of Medicare that would involve a major expansion of publicly financed services to that population given that they enjoy a relatively favored position in the healthcare arena. In the long term, there will need to be a fundamental re-evaluation of the nature of the contract between the federal government and its older citizens. The aims here are much more modest. I discuss four proposals for change: merging the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance programs, improving the Medicare risk program, \"modernizing\" traditional fee-for-service Medicare, and changing the distribution of financing between beneficiaries and the government.Merging HI and SMI.When the Medicare program was first implemented, the hospital played the critical role in the healthcare system. All major and most minor procedures were done in hospitals, and a hospital stay was often a self-contained episode. Since 1965, the role of the hospital has changed as more and more care is provided in outpatient settings.With the development of managed care, in which one entity is responsible for providing all needed services in exchange for a single, fixed amount, the separation of medical care services into two separate funding sources makes little sense. Therefore, the Congress should consider merging these two programs. The funding sources for the merged programs should be a defined combination of payroll tax, income tax, and beneficiary premiums.Improving the Medicare Risk Program.Medicare beneficiaries should have access to quality healthcare services. They should have choices among a number of health plans. They should have incentives to select efficient plans, and plans should have incentives to manage care efficiently. There is a need to bring Medicare beneficiaries into the types of managed care systems that are evolving in the private sector. This will not be easy to do; indeed, it is not obvious that it can be done without putting many Medicare beneficiaries at risk.Researchers and policy analysts have offered a number of plans for moving Medicare into a managed choice model (Dowd et al., 1992; Butler and Moffitt, 1995; Aaron and Reischauer, 1995; Medicare Work Group, 1995). The proposed plans differ in a number of ways:In the range of choices that beneficiaries should be allowed to make (e.g., HMOs, HMOs plus point of service, other fee-for-service plans, and catastrophic insurance plus Medical Savings Accounts).In the proposed methods for paying health plans (e.g., administered prices, negotiated prices, or competitive prices).In whether Medicare should be a competitive option; that is, whether, depending on the prices of the other plans, Medicare beneficiaries should pay more or less to enroll in traditional Medicare.The choices that one makes across this range of possibilities depends upon the answers to questions such as the following: How important is risk selection? Can Medicare adjust for health status in setting payment rates? How relevant is the experience of the private employed sector to the Medicare population? And how will the most vulnerable beneficiaries fare?The Medicare population is different from the employed population in significant ways. It is older, sicker, poorer, and more demented. Current Medicare beneficiaries have much less experience in making the kinds of decisions that are being made by the employed population. Furthermore, risk selection is an important factor. It would be easy for a health plan to target its advertising to attract relatively healthy beneficiaries, and the consequences of having disproportionately healthy people join risk plans are serious. If Medicare cannot adjust its rates appropriately, the overall cost of the program will rise. This event, in turn, will put pressure on the Congress to reduce the prices paid under the fee- for-service system, a practice that could lead to problems of access for those beneficiaries who remain in that system. In addition, the Medicare risk pool will be broken up. The Medigap premiums will rise, reflecting the poorer health of those beneficiaries remaining in traditional Medicare.Therefore, it is necessary to develop the appropriate infrastructure for a choice-based system for Medicare. This development involves identifying an organization at the local level that would manage the choice-based system and be responsible for gathering information and hearing complaints. This organization could be a government or government-contracted private agency. There should be an annual open enrollment period in which all competing plans would offer one standardized health plan or one of a set of standardized plans. (This feature could be modeled on the current system used to market Medigap policies.)Medigap plans should be included in this open enrollment period. Catastrophic plans or Medical Savings Accounts should not be included as an option because I believe that they would break up the Medicare risk pool in a detrimental way. A standard set of information should be made available. It would include price, out- come, and beneficiary satisfaction data. There should be an annual lock- in, but with an allowable disenrollment period the first time an individual enrolls in a specific plan. Lock-ins are desirable because they lead a decrease in risk-selection problems.Medicare payments to HMOs should be based on a revised adjusted average per capita cost (the name given to the method the Health Care Financing Administration uses to set the capitation rates paid, based on the cost of traditional Medicare in the same county). This system would base the prices paid to the local plans on a blended cost of local, regional, and national fee-for-service costs. The costs associated with the payments that Medicare pays to disproportionate- share hospitals (which serve a high volume of indigent patients) and teaching hospitals for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education should not be included in these prices. The best available risk adjustors should be used in making payments to the health plans. As is currently the case, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) should continue to sponsor research and demonstrations to evaluate payment methods, risk adjustment methods, and methods for moving toward a more competitive system. These suggestions are not unique. They are close to those proposed by Congress's Prospective Payment Review Commission in 1995 and Aaron and Reischauer (1995) among others. They differ from the recommendations of more conservative analysts, since they would limit the types of plans that Medicare would sponsor. They also suggest a more gradual approach to encouraging Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in risk plans.It should be pointed out that a substantial number of researchers have received funds to work on these issues, and various panels of experts have been assembled to examine the findings and push the research forward. In addition to the projects funded by HCFA, three activities are worth noting. In early 1996, the Institute of Medicine sponsored a conference to address informational needs ot a Medicare choice-based system. The Kaiser Family Foundation has awarded a grant to monitor advertising and other marketing tools used by Medicare risk plans, and the National Academy of Social Insurance has established a panel on Medicare capitation and choice under its Restructuring Medicare for the Long Term project.Modernizing Traditional Medicare.Under most projections, the traditional Medicare program will continue to be the predominant program for Medicare services for some time to come. Therefore, it is important to strengthen the fee-for-service system and to let it evolve into a managed indemnity system (Ethridge, 1995). Medicare needs to be given the necessary tools to accomplish this taskin spite of the publics current distrust of government. There needs to be a careful evaluation of the administrative procedures system to see how it can be changed to enable HCFA to operate more like a private business. There needs to be a careful evaluation of those areas where HCFA can move into selective contracting. In addition, HCFA needs to continue to work on improving its price-setting methods. I believe it would be useful to re-evaluate the cost-sharing structure of Medicare in order to make it consistent with current practice. Furthermore, I would recommend that consideration be given to letting HCFA offer a catastrophic benefit packagewhich, if designed correctly, could lead to a decrease in the demand for supplemental insurance to cover front-end cost sharing. It surely is more efficient for Medicare to market a linked catastrophic plan than for the private market to do so.Once again, it is worthwhile noting that recommendations to improve traditional Medicare are legion (e.g., Moon, 1993, Moon and Davis, 1995). In addition, groups of experts are being assembled to assess methods for modernizing Medicare. For example, under its long-term project on Medicare, the National Academy has established a panel to explore ways to strengthen traditional Medicare. Changing the financing of Medicare. Under current law, the HI trust fund is financed primarily by the payroll tax and secondarily from interest on the government securities held by the fund. The SMI trust fund is financed by general revenues and from beneficiary-paid premiums. When the Medicare program was first established, beneficiary premiums covered 50 percent of SMI funding; they now cover about 25 percent. The share of SMI costs covered by premiums was a contentious issue during the recent de- bate over Medicare: the Congress wanted to keep the share at just over 30 percent, while the president wanted to revert to the permanent limit of 25 percent. However, the share of the Medicare premium to be paid by Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those with incomes considerably above the poverty level, needs to be reevaluated.Other IssuesUnlike private health plans, Medicare has several obligations and responsibilities that go beyond providing healthcare services for an enrolled population. For example, the Medicare program is a major source of funding for graduate medical education in the country. It has become an important source of funds for rural hospitals and hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low-income people. These responsibilities increase the cost of Medicare. If Medicare is to be compared with private health plans, these responsibilities have to be taken into consideration. If Medicare is to be competitive with private health plans, alternative approaches to providing these services will have to be examined.In conclusion, the Medicare program must change, and the structure of the Medicare program has to be consistent with the healthcare system that is evolving for the majority of Americans. Furthermore, it will be necessary to reevaluate the relative roles of the federal government, the states, and beneficiaries in financing care for the elderly. None of this will be easy. However, the current system is not tenable for the long term, and a restructured system will need to be in place when the baby boomers start to retire.Judith R.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2024Why Care Is So FundamentalBy Alison BiggarOctober 16, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingEconomic SecurityEditing the publications of the American Society on Aging has always felt more like a privilege than a job. During the past 13 years working here, I have learned much more than I originally thought possible. I hadnt come into the job blind, mind you; likely the story of my parents helped me to obtain it in the first place.But isnt that how most people get into this field? Its personal, as much as it is professional.Ive already told this story to anyone who will listen, but my dad died of Alzheimers (well, really from a fall in which he hit his head), at 84 after 8 active years of the disease, by which I mean things were off for years prior to us realizing it, of course. But of interest to this article, for all of those years, my mom, who was only 2 years younger than he was, cared for him mostly alone (my sister lived near-ish and helped out when she could while raising young children). In retrospect, our mom had to have been exhausted, and was often angry at dad, correcting him before people knew to just distract and move on.After his death, mom had a few nice years, then two hip surgeries and a fall from a step stool. That fall rapidly led to her being paralyzed from the neck down, able only to lift one arm. She lived out most of the next 3 years on hospice in a board and care facility with lovely paid caregivers, decent food, and, importantly, access to the Tennis Channel. Somehow she maintained a level of graciousness the entire time that still baffles me and my siblings.We were extremely privileged in that our mother was able to fund this level of care, as none of us could have cared for her in our homes. We also were lucky to have figured out that the first nursing home immediately postbrain surgery nearly killed her, after which we moved her to a beautiful assisted living facility where she contracted full body MRSA and several bouts of severe pneumonia. In time we also figured out the care there was terrible, but in the moment each mounting illness was just another trial to muscle through. Mom was made of incredibly tough stuff, so on she went until we found a place where they cared for her.Caregiving as an individual is a nearly impossible task and it should be a collective responsibility.Despite not doing the bulk of the caregiving, the whole experience taught me multiple lessons, none larger than what it takes to really care for someone.This is a long way of saying that the Fall 2021 issue of Generations, Care Is Fundamental, is my choice for the issue that has lodged most firmly in my head and also in my heart since Ive worked for ASA. Josie Kalipeni, the Guest Editor who laid the foundation for the issue with her introduction, and Sad Dozan, who contributed a piece, wrote two articles Ill never forget.Lasting Impression of One Familys FateKalipenis article,Care in the United States: Our Moment of Crisis, could, Im sure, have been written 20 or 40 years ago, and until theres some sort of caregiving revolution (which these two authors are fomenting, by the way), could be written again in the future.But this issues timing was critical as it was the pandemic that brought the topic to the fore for Kalipeni and her family, inspiring her to write a deeply personal, thoughtful and yet policy-based, solutions-oriented piece. Or as she said, The pandemic didnt so much expose the challenges of caregiving, as it blew the lid off of a national secret: Caregiving as an individual is a nearly impossible task and it should be a collective responsibility.In this one article the challenges of caring for someone, the complexities of immigrating to the United States, the reality of the United States total lack of caregiving infrastructure, and the fact that white-collar professionals may lack a retirement plan are all brought to bear. In a story that is impossible to put down.The image of her family debating how theyll care for her father, who had moved back to their native Malawi to save money and became ill, and her mom, who had used up her paid leave to care for him when he had visited earlier in the year, is beyond poignant. And to think he died in Malawi while they were still figuring out how they might pay for travel to help him clearly demonstrates the dire economic impact of such scenarios.To me this piece shows what can make Generations greata gripping narrative, steeped in unique personalities, yet relevant to everyone and presenting potential solutions.Championing Choice in CaregivingThe second piece forever etched in my mind is Sad Dozans article,Making it Work: Care, Blackness and Generational Values. That article hammers home how, in the United States, caregiving is undervalued as a job and as an intergenerational value. In Dozans piece, she and her partner are just holding it togetherboth of them work and they rely on Dozans mother for childcarewhen her mother has a heart attack.Thats when the carefully woven fabric of caregiving barely holds, the author finds herself in the role of caregiver as her aunts step in to help. Dozan skillfully uses her personal story as a Black sandwich caregiver to weave in statistics our nation should face and fix but does not prioritize. And how even in a position with what would be presumed is an empathetic employer, Dozan finds herself in an incredibly tough spot as she cares for her mom in the hospital. She writes, I will always remember calling my former employer from the hospital lobby to askto pleadfor more time off, only to be told that I had exhausted my leave for my daughters birth; and in the next breath being asked when I would turn in the report that was due.Like Kalipeni, Dozan is a nimble writer, weaving in our countrys devastatingly racist, patriarchal history with what remains today, which is a devaluation of care work in general and dependence upon women to make it all work out somehow. Before this issue, I understood the situation, but I hadnt seen it described so unflinchingly by anyone before Dozan.She also takes on the cultural expectations of women, especially in Black African American households where one is expected to care for loved ones no matter how economically devastating it is, which tends to leave one isolated and lonely as well. Dozan also clearly explicates the financial burden of family caregiving, which can zap as much as 34% of ones annual income.This story, and the entire issue, is wrapped up neatly with the dream that someday we might be able to choose a better option: We have the opportunity to break the cycle and not allow our children to inherit a broken care system and the responsibilities that come with it. As I look at the traditions and values my daughter will inheritchoice must be at the center.Written solely by women of color, it was an unusual Generations issue is many ways, and one that proved seminal in evolving how we do things here at ASA. It reiterated for me what I had known, but maybe not truly taken in, which is the level of privilege my family benefited from when caring for our parents, and how much harder that decade might have been for us.Ive learned an awful lot from the pieces Ive edited at ASA, about how we age in this country, and also about how ancestral circumstances color these aging processes and compound across the generations. It was such a privilege for me to have a chance to work with these incredibly accomplished, brilliant women and I still treasure the work we did on this issue and have done together since.If, for some reason you have not read Care Is Fundamental, I cannot recommend it highly enough.Alison Biggar is ASAs editorial director.Care in the United States: Our Moment of CrisisBy Guest Editor Josephine KalipeniAuthors Note:I was excited to serve as Guest Editor for this historic issue of Generations Journal. All of its contributors are women of color, which is a first for this publication. My participation is an opportunity to continue the conversation on race, gender, and equity within the context of aging.Advocacy in aging conversations often address issues in silos, as if aging erases ones gender, race, and other identities. Nothing could be further from the truth. These articles show how deeply entangled identities are. I am proud to be a part of the intentional shift the American Society on Aging is taking to be a conduit for these sometimes-uncomfortable conversations. I hope this issue inspires you in your advocacy and activism. I hope you are challenged to see the whole of people in how they experience life.The COVID-19 pandemic happened in the exact manner the need for caregiving often happenssuddenly and overnight. You go to sleep peacefully and wake up to realize your world has shut down. You scramble for a few weeks while trying to keep together your work, family, and health, while trying to stabilize a caregiving crisis. Over time, you try to cobble together some kind of caregiving infrastructure for your family.Caregiving families like mine were not surprised by the immense challenges of managing care during the pandemic. If anything, we had been trying to sound the alarm for everyone else.If youre not already in a caregiving situation, this is how its going to happen if our country doesnt put a care infrastructure into place. You will be left to your own devices and resources to figure things out. Some families will succeed in meeting their loved ones needs, but without a care infrastructure, many families will fail, and some will crumble.The pandemic didnt so much expose the challenges of caregiving, as it blew the lid off of a national secret: Caregiving as an individual is a nearly impossible task and it should be a collective responsibility.No Caregiving Support Means You Can Do Everything Right and Still Fall ShortNavigating care is tough, especially for immigrant families. Immigrant families just do not know the system and programs well enough to plan for the possibility of caregiving, nor do they understand how to navigate the labyrinth of programs and insurance once the need hits.My journey to the United States began in 1984 when my father came to this country from Malawi to attend college, thanks to a scholarship. By 1989, he was offered a teaching position and our family, including me, came here to live. Initially, I was dazzled. I had heard all the streets paved with gold stories about life in the United States. When I arrived, those stories seemed true. Everyone in the United States seemed to have a car and a television. Everyone seemed to be doing well. I didnt detect the cracks and disparities until later.My dad did everything right, yet still he was forced to retire in Malawi because it was unaffordable to get care here without the cost falling squarely on my mothers shoulders. The breadwinners of immigrant families not only face challenges accessing care, but they, like my dad, can work their entire adult life and still find access to a secure retirement out of reach.As these twin challenges played in the background, my dad retired. His best solution to the challenges following retirement was to spend most of his time in Malawi. Caregiving and housing are more affordable there. Then, he got sick. His health started to decline and he was in and out of the hospital for a few weeks before he passed. I could hear my parents talking by phone, debating about how soon my mother, who was still living in the United States, should come to Malawi.While they debated, reality sunk in that she didnt have enough paid leave left at her work as a trainer of certified nursing assistants (CAN) and nurse on a medical hotline, to take any time off. My mom had used some of her paid leave to stay home and care for our dad when he had visited in February 2020, while already sick. As his health further declined, they debated when she should go to Malawitheir final decision based, not on concerns about my dads health and comfort, but on how much leave my mother had, and the cost of traveling to Malawi.'Caregiving as an individual is a nearly impossible task and it should be a collective responsibility.This dilemma is a common one for immigrant families, and makes it easy to see how relatively small decisions can backfire and then burn. If our mom went to Malawi, family members would have to cover her travel costs. While my parents debated, my siblings and I wondered, What if she takes unpaid leave? What happens with her monthly expenses and how do we cover them?My sister was unemployed at the time and could be present with our mother. I was working remotely and could make it home quickly. I wondered if I could take leave time from my work to be with my mom while we were trying to figure that out. I discovered one of the privileges of remote workworking from anywhere meant I didn't have to take leave.My father died in the midst of the pandemic. We were all at my mothers house, trying to figure out travel, cost of travel, and how many of us could go. We looked for an open travel route to Malawi because the typical route had been cut off due to the pandemic. We vacillated and planned among travel costs, who could go, who could stay, and who had the most flexibility. We had to balance our desire to support our mother and honor our fathers life with wondering who best could weather a financial setback by going.My sisters went with Mom. Even in that moment of grief, we were focused on how to afford travel costs, and how to pay for funeral arrangements and my fathers remaining healthcare debt. The bills snowballed during his illness and after he died. After we decided on travel plans and funeral arrangements, we had to sort out his medical debt and put together a financial plan for my mom. Where was the time for grief?When Children Are the Retirement PlanFinancial concerns didnt end with the funeral and didnt concern only my fathers medical debt. My mother is 61 and still working her two jobs. In addition to working, my mother has been a caregiver since the 1990s, when my fathers health first began to decline. She spent time trying to figure out how she could retire early and rest. Caregiving is a huge task. Working is a huge task. She wanted to retire, spend time with her husband, and be available for his care. It wasnt a lot to ask, but it never happened.My mom had worked in education administration in Malawi, but the United States wouldnt recognize her education, degrees, or experience. So she had to begin again. In the U.S. system she started work late, and from scratch. First, as a nanny and domestic worker, then in daycare and eventually as a CNA. My father was a professor and sought tenure for years. In the meantime, he had meager benefits and retirement savings. All of this while both were supporting a young family.Also my mom co-signed on my brothers student loan. She believed that a good education was required for progress in this country, but it also meant that, as an immigrant, my parents were constantly coming from behind and struggling to keep up. Its a classic immigrant story: the kids are getting older, your income is stagnant and not keeping up with the cost of living, and youre on the hook for education costs, multiple cars, wanting to live in a safe neighborhood, and wanting to buy a house.My dads health declined slowly for about 20 years. As the primary breadwinner for an immigrant family in the United States, often, you also are primarily responsible for everyone back home. There was such a pull on finances that my parents couldnt even think about savings. My parents thought about retiring, but to them, us kids were their retirement plan. They made all these sacrifices in the hopes that we would be minimally financially independent and wouldnt have to rely upon them. In an ideal world, my siblings and I would support their care in their later years.This also had been our expectation. My siblings and I have always seen ourselves as our parents retirement plan. We knew we would need to provide or supplement their retirement income, for expenses and care and caregiving. We knew they didnt have any savings and their retirement income would not be enough to cover living expenses, let alone care expenses. At some point, those costs would all be on us.My father was receiving a small pension when he died, so that pension now supplements my mothers financial needs. That takes away some of the financial pressure. Things arent so urgent. But what does it say for your countrys safety net if your children have to be your retirement plan and your spouse has to die for you to live?What Dignified Care Looks LikeIt was not just our goal as a family to make sure my fathers basic care needs were met. We wanted to make sure his needs were met in a way that allowed him to maintain his dignity. To do this, his care had to be culturally competent. My mothers cultural competence in my fathers care may seem small, but these small things were of critical importance.My father loved eating beef stew or curry chicken, but only when made by my mom. She made his favorite dishes for him and adjusted her cooking methods, decreasing salt and using fresh tomatoes instead of canned to avoid the acidity that irritated him. He wasnt supposed to drink alcohol, but my mother knew that you cant tell an African man not to drinkthat was an unrealistic expectation. Instead she convinced him to try drinks with lower alcohol levels, like lite beer. These important accommodations and adjustments allowed my father to maintain his dignity throughout his care.Care Is Not Just for Kids, But for the Whole Lifespan and Full CommunityA few weeks ago I was on Vox, talking about care and the Biden administration plans to address care. Before the show started, the host complained, Im a Black woman. Im not married and don't have kids. Theres nothing in Bidens plan that would work for me.I was astounded. What the host didnt understand is that paid leave isnt just for parents, which is how the national discourse often frames conversations about paid leave. Because of this, there are a bunch of childless women who suddenly feel as if they dont see themselves in this issue.I explained to the host that I didnt have any children, either, but Im thinking about doing a second round of in-vitro fertilization (IVF). There's so much that goes into it that requires care and caregiving and time off.My siblings and I have always seen ourselves as our parents retirement plan.I also told her that my mom is getting older and my siblings and I are going to be called on for her care. We need leave for that. I encouraged her to think about the people in her family who are going to need additional support in predictable and unpredictable ways. For instance, when my sister had such a bad anxiety attack that she had to be hospitalized for two days. My sister lives in Illinois and I had to drop everything in Washington, DC, and go to her. I needed leave for that, too.The way the care conversation is being framed may seem exclusive of Black working women who dont have children, when actually that same framing puts the expectation on us first. Theres a cultural expectation that I should be the one stepping in for my familys care needs because I don't have kids. That feels really hard, but I need leave, regardless of whether or not I have children.Even if we take any and all conversations about having children out of it, several years ago, I had fibroid tumors removedan increasingly common procedure among Black women. The doctors told me it would take anywhere from two weeks to three months to heal and get off pain medications. It took me two months. Only the flexibility of my work made those two months seem less arduous. I had to tap into disability and paid Family and Medical Leave Act benefits. But at least I had those benefits to tap into. Many other Black women dont have access to those benefits and are forced to drag themselves back to work before their bodies have a chance to heal. They need access to a care infrastructure.And so does my mother. She needs access to a strong care infrastructure. My mom, like many in their 60s (Gibson, 2019), doesnt have savings. That means I have to consider the impact of her caregiving on my income and savings. And I have to consider what happens about 30 years from now when I need care. I think about having kids and not having kids. When I think about not having children, I have to think about whos going to be around to care for me. It will likely be my siblings, but what will be the impact on them? When I think about starting a family, I think about the costs of IVF that are not covered by healthcare insurance. Most women cant afford IVF treatments and other family planning interventions out-of-pocket. I cant afford it because of caregiving for my parents. I need access to a strong care infrastructure.How could this story be different? What if our infrastructure included the means to allow people to retire and have access to the financial resources and dignified, culturally competent care they need? What if my father didnt have to leave the country to be able to afford care? What if my mother didnt have to spend my fathers last days worrying about money and how his needs would be met? What if I didnt have to balance my desire to have a child with my mothers financial needs? What if we lived in a country that valued compassion over a pseudo self-sufficiency, which in actuality glorifies wealth and access to wealth?My mother needs a strong care infrastructure. I need a strong care infrastructure. And you need a strong care infrastructure, too.JosephineKalipeni, MA, is Executive Director of Family Values @ Work in Washington, DC.ReferencesGibson, W.

This devaluation is deeply rooted in the historically racist, patriarchal structures of uncompensated slave labor, which viewed caregiving as womens work in the home, associated with women of color, and which is increasingly performed by undocumented immigrant women. This article explores the firsthand experience black caregivers continue to face today, with a particular focus on inherited values, challenges, and the women behind this essential yet undervalued work.Key Words:caregiver, Black caregiver, equity, Black families, generational values, care infrastructureA family tradition is a pattern of behavior that reflects and reinforces a family's values, attitudes, or beliefs. For my family, this took the shape of caregivingan intergenerational practice that, while it represented our values, has been left unsupported and isolated by U.S. policies and societal beliefs. It started with my abuela, a domestic worker who, for more than a decade, worked in private homes and even in one governors mansion.In 1948, at age 24, there was an explosion in her employers kitchen that resulted in the gradual loss of her eyesight. As her sight diminished, my mother and her sisters took care of her. For an entire generation, my mother and aunts struggled to navigate the fractured care system, desperately trying to care for my abuela, with no support outside of family or access to trained quality care. They consistently faced poverty, and barely kept their heads above water.Although my abuela died before I was bornstatistical odds stacked against usI knew her (Noonan, Velasco-Mondragon, and Wagner, 2016). Her spirit lives in every story my mother tells, the lessons we have learned, and the actions of my family. I grew up in a family that lived by the phrase, make it worka mantra not uncommon for women of color (Woods-Giscomb, 2010).When in 2018 my partner and I found out we were having a baby, we knew our family would do the same to help us offset the high cost of full-time childcare. The plan was for my now retired mother to care for my daughter half of the week so my partner and I could maintain our full-time jobsa common arrangement resulting in more than 2.5 million grandparents in the United States acting as primary caregivers of grandchildren (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018).Like many families, we were piecemealing everything together to make it workbut when my daughter was 6 months old, my mother had a major heart attack. Seemingly overnight, the family tradition was passed to me as I joined the ranks of 43 million Americans who take on the added role of family caregivera relative, partner, friend, or neighbor who provides any form of care to children, older adults, and people who are disabled. And just as they did for their mother, my aunts flocked to my mothers side. Once again, for the second time in their generation, my aunts helped weave together a care plan that would become my inherited responsibility.But care is a job.I juggled as well as I couldnavigating the hospital system, childcare options, negotiating leave at my former joball while trying to ensure my mothers autonomy and her choices were being respected. She didnt want to live in an institution, she wanted to be cared for at home. However, she didnt want to make us feel as if caring for her was our sole responsibility or another job for me, either.But care is a job. As activities performed by people to provide services for others, both paid and unpaid care work meet the definition of \"work\" (International Labor Organization, 2018). For a while, the job of one full-time caregiver was split between family members: we rotated shifts, provided companionship, prepared meals, managed medications, liaised with medical providers, and spent hours on the phone with insurance companies struggling to coordinate something as simple as wheelchair and walker coverage. These are tasks family caregivers report spending 24 hours per week performing for their loved ones (AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, 2020). Eventually, when family members left for home, my father and I faced the reality of the long road ahead.False NarrativesAlthough my maternal side is Puerto Ricandue in large part to the color of my skin, my Black father, and the greater extent of my cultural upbringingI am a Black woman. My experiences with care are that of a Black sandwich caregiver, named to express the feeling of being squeezed between two or more sets of caregiving pressures (Weber-Raley, 2019). In my case, providing care for a young child and aging parents.More than a fifth of Black adults and nearly a third of Black caregivers fall into this Sandwich Generation (Parker and Patten, 2013; Bonello, 2020). Furthermore, 57 percent of Black family caregivers fall in the high burden caregiving bracketproviding an average of thirty hours per week (Bonello, 2020). For these caregiversthe majority of whom are womenthe double-duty caregiving responsibilities for children and adult family members cause especially acute financial and emotional stress, forcing families to cut back on work hours and navigate disjointed fragments of a care system with little to no formal support (Weber-Raley, 2019).I learned firsthand that this lack of formal support severely limits families options. Caring for your loved ones should be a chosen responsibilitynot a byproduct of a fragmented system. However, for many of us, the choice of caregiving was more of an inherited burden presented as family values.Family and societal expectationsunderlined by the lack of adequate systems and supportsculminate in limited options and a reinforced false narrative that we (family members) are in this alone. I will always remember calling my former employer from the hospital lobby to askto pleadfor more time off, only to be told that I had exhausted my leave for my daughters birth; and in the next breath being asked when I would turn in the report that was due.Sitting in the family hospital waiting room, there I wasfrantically typing to meet a deadline on one half of the laptop screen, and looking at a list of post-recovery care options for my mother on the other. I remember the quietthe clicking of my keyboard, and the heavy feeling that I had no choice. I was in this alonethere were no universal leave options, not enough long-term services and supports (LTSS) benefits, and no access to free quality childcare to alleviate the added responsibilities I had as a working mother and caregiver.The devaluation of care in such narratives is deeply rooted in the historically racist, patriarchal structures of uncompensated slave labor, which viewed caregiving as womens work. Even 156 years post-slaverys abolition, care remains devalued and those experiencing the deepest inequities are women of colorlike myself, my mother, and my abuela.We are told, and we tell ourselves to just make it work. Devaluation of care ripples through our society, and care jobs like my abuelas remain disproportionately undervalued. As sociological studies have shown, gender- and race-based biases associating care work with women of color foster the devaluation of that work.Even when controlling for necessary skills, educational requirements, and industry, there exists a net pay penalty of 5 to 10 percent for care-related occupations (England, 2005). Often domestic workersthose who work in the households of their employershave families of their own. At least 60 percent of domestic workers in the United States are younger than age 50 and thereby likely to have children of their own to care for (Wolfe et al., 2020).Moreover, 58.3 percent of domestic workers are women of color: a group that is statistically more likely to live in multigenerational households where they are expected to perform unpaid caregiving for older loved ones (Wolfe et al., 2020). Caregivers are underpaid for their time and labor, with 36 percent of caregivers of adults older than age 50 reporting moderate to high levels of financial strain (AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, 2015). This financial strain can preclude caregivers from attending to their own families care needs, further perpetuating the cycle of maintaining responsibility because theres no other choice. We must move away from the false narrative that care is done on your own.We must move away from the false narrative that care is done on your own.Care is valuableboth outside and inside the home. Care is essential, allowing families to sustainably participate in the workforce (Kalipeni and Kashen, 2020). However, the United States has a long way to go before its policies are comprehensive enough to support the full spectrum of care needed for families. The productivity lost in the U.S. economy due to our lack of a comprehensive care infrastructure is more than $25 billion per year, a seemingly impossible-to-close gap that has pernicious effects on caregivers livelihoods (Witters, 2011). Without concerted investments in care infrastructure, many families will be unable to engage in the economy and will be forced to pass down the cultural expectation to care for your own and just make it work.For Black households especially, the cultural expectation to maintain care of loved ones regardless of financial stressors, can create the feeling of loneliness or isolation. On average, one in five U.S. households are intergenerational; 13 percent of non-Hispanic White households and 34.7 percent of Black African American households are multigenerational (Cohn and Kochhar, 2011). The assumed caregiving responsibilities that many of these households caregivers face create additional stressors. A survey released in 2021 by the Diverse Elders Coalitions Caregiving Initiative found that approximately 30 percent of Black caregivers report feeling more isolation and physical and mental strain as a result of caregiving responsibilities (Boddie and Le, 2020).Black family caregivers represent 14 percentapproximately 7.2 millionof the estimated 48 million unpaid family caregivers in the United States, with Black women comprising 7.49 percent of this population (AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, 2020). There is unprecedented pressure on unpaid care work as the rapidly aging population increases the demand for care labor. With one out of six individuals expecting to become caregivers within the next two years, there is no alleviation of this burden in the future, either (Edwards et al., 2020). Despite incremental progress addressing racial inequality, the disparities that effectively turn the responsibility of care into a burden of care are detrimental to the advancement of Black family caregivers in the home, the workplace, and the community, therefore stunting the progress and economic mobility of these individuals.Displaced and StrugglingDisplaced especially are middle-income familiesmany of whom do not qualify for public benefits due to income regulations, but still fall short of the income needed to fully support paid caregiving. Black middle-income families face particularly large barriers due to a lack of accumulated wealththey are more than four times as likely as those in White middle-income families to have parents below the poverty line (OBrien, 2012). This means many middle-income Black caregivers likely experience more significant strains on income. The average cost for center-based daycare in the United States is $11,896 per year for an infant and $10,158 per year for toddlers (Child Care Aware of America, 2019).Meanwhile, according to Genworths 2020 Cost of Care Survey, the average annual costs of homemaker services and home health aides for an older or ill adult are $53,768 and $54,912 per year, respectively (Genworth, 2020). The stark facts today are that with the high costs of childcare and LTSS, only the wealthy can afford to choose how and where they care, and only the poorest can access that care through under-resourced public programsleaving the majority (52 percent) with little recourse but to care for their own (Bennett, Fry, and Kochhar, 2020).With the heightened pressure of needing to provide care, employment is critical to survival. While six out of ten family caregivers remain employed, Black caregivers are most likely (64 percent) to work while providing care and often have no access to family leave policies (Feinberg and Skufca, 2020). And while family caregivers report being penalized or discriminated against due to their caregiving responsibilities, Black caregivers were more likely to report a higher occurrence of penalization or discrimination at work due to their caregiving obligations.Family caregivers who provide care to adult relatives or friends spend an average of $6,954 of their annual income, or nearly 20 percent, on out-of-pocket costs, such as rent and utilities, home modifications related to mobility, insurance costs, and other medical expenses (Mehegan, Rainville, and Skufca, 2016). Between the two generations for which I care, I spend nearly 40 percent of my full-time income on careworking a second job as a consultant to offset expenses to ensure I am able to pivot to meet my familys shifting needs and maintain my ability to work toward generational wealth. This goal is disproportionately out of reach for the average Black family, which maintains a wealth rate nearly ten times less than the average White family (McIntosh et al., 2020).My care expenses are far from uncommon; parental caregiving is known to be a decelerator of wealth (Lee, 2015). Black caregivers spend more than 34 percent of their annual income on care-related costs, compared to 14 percent for their White counterparts (Mehegan, Rainville, and Skufca, 2016). Women, particularly those with low incomes, who quit their jobs or retire early due to caregiving responsibilities lose, on average, more than $142,000 in wages and more than $131,000 in Social Security benefits over the course of their lifetimes (MetLife Mature Market Institute, 2011).Women who quit jobs or retire early due to caregiving lose more than $142,000 in wages and more than $131,000 in Social Security benefits.Being a Black working caregiver means that I often navigate systems created as a way to exclude me and my family. Black family caregivers hold a crushing amountinequitable access to medicine, poorer treatment quality, and distrust of the care system (Rucker and Williams, 2000; Institute of Medicine, 2003; Kennedy, Mathis, and Woods, 2007). Overall, this underlines a dichotomy around current policies and our ability to access and navigate care systems. We age with a higher rate of health conditions, affecting our life span and quality of life; many of these conditions are due to the lack of access to quality care throughout our lives, and the limits of policies that support our responsibilities (Taylor, 2019).Many of us constantly operate in crisis mode. We take out credit cards, rally friends and families to support us in emergencies. But the truth is were almost always teetering on the edge of disaster. So many times I have felt that I am almost at the end of my rope, one unexpected bill short of it all falling apart. However, its hard to express this. Cultural notions have made it so that many Black caregivers do not talk about mental health distress at the same rates as their White counterparts (Blue Cross Blue Shield, 2020). We need to shine a spotlight on care, and its impact on our livelihoods.Invisible No LongerUntil the pandemic caregiving was rarely mentioned publiclyespecially in the mediabut by 2021 Care Infrastructure was trending, with care work called as essential as bridges and roads (Donegan, 2021). But the emerging debate, sparked by President Bidens announcement that the American Jobs Plan includes a $400 billion Medicaid expansion, is neither new nor surprising. Care has always been infrastructure; from childcare to paid leave, to home- and community-based services, care is a need shared by all at some point in our lives, and is fundamental to enabling economic activity. But it has never before been valued as such in our political discourse because womenespecially Black womenhave shouldered the work of our care economy.To improve Black lives, we must improve care. Care is essential to our health, wealth, and livelihood. We need to keep the momentum going through intentional investment, and by centering those most impacted by the crumbling infrastructureBlack and Brown sandwich caregivers like me.COVID-19 has shown our country what happens when families lack access to quality, affordable childcare or eldercare; when care systems and facilities cannot ensure the safety of those in their care; when women must choose between their careers and their family; and when workers must choose between their health and their livelihoods. The consequences of the pandemic have been significantly greater for Black communitiesparticularly Black caregivers at the intersection of multiple socioeconomic challenges. These unpaid caregivers face a disproportionate number of emotional, physical, and financial challenges that affect their ability to care for themselves and their loved ones (Boddie and Le, 2020).Perhaps even more alarming are challenges facing Black mothers, especially in the wake of the pandemic. As childcare centers and schools closed, women of color were hit hardest as they disproportionately hold care jobs, have partners who work outside the home, and have long struggled to gain access to such services for their kids. Black women, of whom 73 percent are primary household breadwinners, make up a bit more than a tenth of all women workers in the United States and have the highest labor force participation rate among women (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021). But, one in four women is considering leaving the workforce or downshifting her career due to COVID-19, and since March 1, 2020, 11 percent of Black women have reported quitting a job for reasons related to COVID-19 (Ranji et al., 2021). Prior to the pandemic, mothers were three times as likely as fathers to leave the workforce due to increased care needs for a family member (Parker, 2015).I envision a world where I dont have to choose between work or care; where I dont have to make the impossible choice between paying for my mothers care over my daughters; a world where waiting lists are cleared so high-quality, affordable care is an option; and where care jobs are good jobs. For too long, we have lived with a patchwork system, tethered together with the flimsiest of threads; passing down the mantra of make it workit isnt enough. As the population grows, we need to make care the heart of our values. Supporting caregiving, both paid and unpaid, is at the core of how we move forward. The devaluation of care has created gaps in our infrastructure; which has created the false narrative that the responsibility for care is held individually or by ones family.There is joy in knowing that I am able to share this journey with my mother and father. Joy in knowing I am able to provide them with as much support as I can; incorporate them into my daughters history and understanding of her ancestry. I feel rooted in our relationship, but we can no longer remain rooted in the false narrative that care isnt a priority for our society.We deserve more. We all deserve to be treated fairly, with dignity, and have our needs met in our caremost importantly we deserve the choice of how we want to give and receive care. We have the opportunity to break the cycle and not allow our children to inherit a broken care system and the responsibilities that come with it. As I look at the traditions and values my daughter will inheritchoice must be at the center.Sade Dozan is the Senior Director of Development at Caring Across Generationsa campaign working to change the way care is valued in this country through policy, advocacy, and culture change initiatives.

RizzoJune 26, 2024TagsInnovation & Social ImpactHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureAbstract:It takes a long time to integrate research evidence into healthcare practice and policy. Older adults with chronic conditions and social needs cannot wait. Interprofessional Collaborative (IPC) research teams encourage examining healthcare problems through multiple lenses. These teams also may build information and community networks that efficiently integrate new and innovative research into clinical practice and policy. In this article, we highlight two healthcare studies conducted by our IPC research teams exploring the health of older adults with chronic conditions. We also discuss the importance of including social workers as experts in social care on IPC clinical and research teams.Key Words:Interprofessional Collaborative (IPC) research teams, social workIt takes a long time to integrate research evidence into healthcare practice and policy (Barr et al., 2021; Nystrom et al., 2018; Rubin, 2023). A widely cited estimate is that it takes approximately 17 years to integrate research evidence into clinical practice and that only 1 in 5 evidence-based interventions ever become part of routine practice (Rubin, 2023). During this time, patients bear the burden due to delays in receiving beneficial, evidence-based healthcare services (Barr et al., 2021). Additionally, third-party reimbursement for these services lags due to the time it takes for policy implementation to catch up to the science. As such, patients assume avoidable high-cost premiums and out-of-pocket expenses that might otherwise be covered by insurance and third-party reimbursement (Glied & Zhu, 2020).Older adultsespecially patients with chronic conditions and social needsare unable to wait for research and policy to catch up. Nearly all older adults have one chronic health condition and 80% have two or more (Administration for Community Living, 2022). These conditions, which affect daily living and negatively impact quality of life, health, and mortality (Mode et al., 2016) are compounded by social needs (McGilton et al., 2018).Almost 50% of older adults have unmet social needs, which include basics like food and housing (Haff et al., 2022). Older adults, particularly those from marginalized Black communities, are at greater risk for poorer health than the general population (Fulmer et al., 2021). Additionally, in 2020, almost 5 million adults ages 65 and older lived below the poverty level, with another 2.6 million just above (Administration for Community Living, 2022).Older adults with multiple chronic conditions also may be more likely to become socially isolated than their peers (Abdi et al., 2019; Christiansen et al., 2021), thus increasing their risk of premature mortality (Iovino et al., 2023). Two recent scoping reviews found that older adults living with chronic conditions experience several unmet social challenges, including a lack of care coordination and support (Abdi et al., 2019; McGilton et al., 2018). Older adults also experience challenges with social relationships, mental health, self-care, and mobility (Abdi et al., 2019).The prevalence of chronic health conditions and unmet social needs experienced by older adults highlights the importance of efficiently translating research to practice and policy. It is imperative to consider the clinical and social care contexts when conducting evidence-based research. In healthcare research, interprofessional collaborative (IPC) teams are key to exploring complex phenomenon, such as how to best support older adults with multiple chronic conditions and social needs (Nystrom et al., 2018).IPC teams involve researchers from two or more professions (e.g., medicine, nursing, social work, community partners, academia, and others) working together to produce new scientific knowledge (Green & Johnson, 2015). IPC research teams encourage examining healthcare problems through multiple lenses and may serve to build information and community networks. When professionals work collaboratively, they are well positioned to integrate new and innovative research into clinical practice and advocate for policy change.While there is a dearth of research examining the impact of IPC research teams on the time it takes to influence practice and policy, there is evidence that IPC research teams positively affect health outcomes and enhance healthcare efficiency (Green & Johnson, 2015). In this article, we highlight two studies conducted by our IPC research teams that sought to improve the health of older adults with chronic conditions. We briefly describe each study and share the real or potential impacts of this research on healthcare practice and policy. We also discuss the importance of including clinical and research social workers on IPC teams. Despite being overlooked as valuable members of research teams (Bloeser & Bausman, 2019), social workers are well-prepared to enhance healthcare practice and influence policies that support older adults.IPC Healthcare Research Studies on AgingBelow, we present two research studies conducted by our IPC research teams exploring the effect of the Ambulatory Integration of Medical and Social (AIMS) model on caring for older adults. The AIMS model of care management was developed by the Center for Health and Social Care Integration (CHaSCI), a training and policy center based at RUSH University Medical Center (RUSH). Initially created to integrate social workers onto interprofessional primary care teams, AIMS is a holistic care management model that addresses patients social needs and barriers to care. AIMS is delivered by masters-prepared social workers in coordination with, and often embedded with, outpatient care teams.Health Risk and DepressionRizzo et al. (2022) conducted a 1-year longitudinal, comparison group study that examined differences in outcomes for older patients who received AIMS and those who received usual care. Usual care involved a nurse providing information on health risk and depression. A second goal was to examine the role of social workers in affecting these outcomes.An important first step in conducting this research was getting buy-in from all stakeholders, such as hospital administrators and healthcare providers. This was achieved by working with physician champions who recognized the importance of social care in healthcare. The physician champions brokered conversations with administrators and other healthcare providers and educated them on the importance of advancing IPC clinical research. Equally important was identifying professionals for the IPC clinical research team. This was guided by study methods dictating that we identify which professionals were needed to execute the project. After a series of conversations with the AIMS social worker and physician champions, it became evident that the team needed to include a range of professionals and assistants to carry out the project.The IPC research team included doctors, nurses, social workers, research assistants, hospital administrators, and academic researchers.The IPC research team included: 1) doctors responsible for identifying patients with social needs; 2) nurses who referred patients to the AIMS group or usual care group and documented steps in usual care; 3) social workers who delivered AIMS and documented the steps and activities completed in patient electronic health records; 4) research assistants who conducted follow-up interviews with patients to collect longitudinal outcome data; 5) hospital administrators who addressed internal barriers; and 6) academic researchers who developed the methodology, identified or created the measurement tools, oversaw data collection, analyzed and interpreted the data, and reviewed patient electronic health records.With the IPC members in place, the project was undertaken. Factors that contributed to successfully carrying out the clinical research were communication among team members, trust and respect for one anothers roles, and shared understanding of how each professionals role contributed to the goal of the research and patient outcomes. According to Green and Johnson (2015), these are essential ingredients for conducting IPC research.The study included 340 patients ages 50 and older who had two or more chronic health conditions and received primary healthcare at one of six RUSH clinics. Although the findings revealed no significant effects between AIMS and usual care on the outcomes, AIMS patients (n = 170) showed significantly lower levels of health risk and depression at 6 months (Rizzo et al., 2022). These findings were used to advance wider integration of the AIMS training within the RUSH healthcare system [Rowe et al., 2016) and other healthcare environments (Rowe et al., 2021). Additionally, these findings reified CHaSCI's commitment to advocating for reimbursement for social care, including needs assessments and ongoing care provision.As part of this study, Rowe, Rizzo, Kang, et al. (2019) also examined the effect of time as part of care management (i.e., AIMS and usual care) on participants depression levels. The social workers documented the amount of time they spent delivering AIMS to intervention group patients in the electronic health records. Documenting time spent providing usual care was not part of their clinical practice; however, the nurses completed a brief survey in which they estimated the time spent providing usual care to the comparison group. Time data extracted from the electronic health record for AIMS patients and from the survey for usual care patients were compared.Findings revealed that social workers spent significantly more time with patients providing care management compared to nurses. The findings further suggest that the more time spent with patients was linked to lower levels of depression. These findings directly impacted practice at RUSH by altering the way AIMS social workers document their work in the electronic health record (Rowe, Rizzo, Guthrie, et al., 2019). This research also provided greater evidence regarding the value and importance of social workers as part of IPC healthcare and research teams (Fraser et al., 2018; Ross et al., 2024).It is important to note that to our knowledge there is no research comparing social workers to other professionals in delivering care management (Rowe, Rizzo, Kang, et al., 2019). As such, we are unable to say whether these outcomes might be observed elsewhere. Regardless, the findings document positive outcomes for patients and enhanced procedures in the clinical environment.Importance of Community PartnershipsMoro and colleagues are conducting a retrospective analysis examining the value of adding community health worker services to existing social work care management teams at a large, national primary and specialty care community group that serves older adults. In this community group, all of their social work care managers and community health workers were trained by the CHaSCI team. The social workers received training on the AIMS model.This study uses the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework (Glasgow et al., 2019) to evaluate program outcomes, including cost and utilization, for in-patient, emergency department and primary care visits, patient health status, and model fidelity and adherence. Retrospective data were collected for all patients referred for care management services during a 3-month time period.Communication among the team, respect for one anothers roles, and shared understanding of each role spelled success for research goals and patient outcomes.The research team consists of an academic healthcare researcher (Moro), a statistician, a healthcare economist, and a community partner. The healthcare researcher worked closely with the healthcare economist to design the study and determine how to best collect and analyze cost and utilization data. Both collaborated with the community partner to translate what data we were hoping to obtain and what information they were able to provide. The statistician is in the process of cleaning the cost and utilization data. Patient demographics and healthcare status are also being cleaned and analyzed.Because the study is ongoing, its direct impact on practice and policy is unclear. According to the first systematized review exploring collaboration between social workers and community health workers, Noel et al. (2022) found that this collaboration may increase patients access to care and address health inequities; but more research is needed. The team at RUSH anticipates that this work will contribute to the scholarship exploring these essential professional partnerships in improving health and healthcare delivery for older adults. Given RUSHs strong commitment to this partnership, the findings will be presented to both teams and serve as a springboard for future collaborative research.Social Workers on IPC Healthcare and Research TeamsIncluding social workers on IPC practice and research teams is important because they help teams effectively address social needs (U.S. Department of Health Human Services, 2023) and move research into practice and policies that support older adults. In healthcare, social workers perform several roles including care coordination, transitional care, case management, behavioral interventions, and completing intake assessments (Milano et al., 2022; Petruzzi et al., 2023).Research has documented the valuable contributions social workers make to IPC teams serving older adults. For example, in their scoping review exploring the value of social work on IPC healthcare teams, Ross et al. (2024) found 75% of the studies reviewed described social workled interventions focused on the care of older adults and that health and cost outcomes were generally positive. Similarly, in their review of 42 studies examining the impact of social work interventions in aging on quality of life and cost, Rizzo and Rowe (2016) found that 71% reported significant quality-of-life outcomes. Significant cost savings also were documented in 71.4% of the 21 studies that included cost outcomes. Other studies also have found that including social workers on IPC teams improves patient care, behavioral health (Fraser et al., 2018), and other quality metrics (Lombardi et al., 2024).A 2019 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report titledIntegrating Social Care into the Delivery of Health Care: Moving Upstream to Improve the Nations Healthrecognized social workers as experts in social care and essential members of healthcare teams. The report outlined five essential tasks necessary to address social care needs, including: 1)Awarenessof activities that identify the social risks, needs, and assets of populations served; 2)Adjustmentof clinical care to accommodate identified social barriers; 3)Assistanceor engaging in activities to reduce social risk by connecting patients with social care resources; 4)Alignmentof activities undertaken by healthcare systems to understand and utilize existing social care assets; and 5) Advocacy efforts in which healthcare organizations work with partner social care organizations to impact policy.Social workers areadvocateswho work with healthcare/research teams plus community organizations to develop effective and culturally aware interventions.Social workers in healthcare are already engaged in all five of these activities. Specifically, they areawareof the needs and strengths of the communities they serve because they work closely with, and are integrated into, community spaces. Social workers meet patients, families, and communities where they are and provide invaluable insight into necessary clinicaladjustmentsthat enable the healthcare team to accommodate and address social barriers. In addition, social workers partner with patients and families toassistthem in locating and obtaining essential resources by addressing both internal and external healthcare system barriers. As bridge builders, social workers helpalignteams across sectors to attend to the needs of patients and families, community-based organizations, and the healthcare team.For example, Craig et al. (2020) found that social workers described their roles as empowering collaboration by actively communicating and proactively educating both other members of the healthcare team and patients. Finally, social workers are advocates who work with healthcare and research teams as well as community social care organizations to develop effective and culturally aware interventions.Despite the importance of their roles and important contributions in healthcare and research, social workers often are overlooked as members of IPC teams (Bloeser & Bausman, 2019). This is due in large part to the lack of a standardized definition of what social workers do, limited research on their unique contributions, and research that includes social workers but fails to describe how they are involved. Additionally, the limited research on the value of social work often lacks scientific rigor (Rizzo & Rowe, 2016; Rowe, Rizzo, Kang, et al., 2019; Ross et al., 2024). Finally, a lack of standardized payments from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance may inhibit the inclusion of social workers on IPC teams due to limited billing options for the services social workers provide (NASEM, 2019; National Association of Social Workers, 2023).ConclusionEvidence-based clinical research is critical to the health of older adults. However, the challenge of moving the evidence to practice and influencing policy in a timely manner persists (Barr et al., 2021; Nystrom et al., 2018; Rubin, 2023). This situation, coupled with the reality that nearly all older adults have a chronic condition (Administration for Community Living, 2022) and almost half have unmet social needs (Haff et al., 2022), points to the importance of IPC research teams that examine aging through multiple lenses. Social workers are an important profession central to addressing social care needs for patients and communities, yet they have been historically underrepresented on IPC research teams (Bloeser & Bausman, 2019).While we argue that IPC teams are important in conducting high-quality health research with older adults, more research is needed. In the era of cost containment, it is essential to understand the role and contribution of each discipline on IPC teams. Identifying the unique contributions of each discipline will ensure the right combination of skills to maximize older adults health outcomes, appropriate use of services, and cost containment by eliminating unnecessary, costly care. Understanding the roles and contributions of each discipline also may lead to faster adoption of evidence-based practices into healthcare and community-based settings as well as Medicare and Medicaid billing policies and practices that encourage the adoption of evidence-based IPC team research and practice.Acknowledgement:Wed like to acknowledge Yanjun Dong for helping with this article.Teresa Moro, PhD, AM, LSW, is an assistant professor in the Department of Social Work in the College of Health Sciences and a health services researcher with the Center for Health and Social Care Integration at RUSH University Medical Center in Chicago.

Zawadski and Jennie Chin HansenJune 26, 2024TagsInnovation & Social ImpactHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CulturePACE, the Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly, is an innovative and rapidly growing model of services for older adults needing long term, chronic care. Today there are 159 PACE programs operating in 32 states and the District of Columbia. These programs operate more than 300 PACE centers, serving more than 72,000 participants across the country (National PACE Association, n.d.).PACE is predicated on a simple ideaproviding services based on what the individual needs, not on what is reimbursable. Like an HMO, PACE receives capitation payments instead of multiple service fees for the delivery of all needed services. Unlike an HMO, which focuses on risk managementspreading the cost of services for the few sick across the mostly healthy manyPACE focuses on service management. PACE optimizes the management and delivery of services needed by a group of people, all of whom need continuing care and support. Information played a key role in the development of PACE and is key to its success.Program GenesisThree Key IngredientsPACE had its genesis in the Chinatown/North Beach section of San Francisco in the early 1970s. Three forces came together to make it happen. A caring public health department dentist brought together community leaders with the goal of building a nursing home in their community to care for their frail elders. The group received a small grant to hire a Swiss social worker with a commonsense, can-do attitude to help them. That social worker found that starting a nursing home not only was not possible but also was not a good option. She proposed instead the development of an adult day care center modeled after British day hospitals. The group applied for and received one of four federal Administration on Aging (AoA) day center demonstration grants.The social worker was hired as the executive director of the program now known as On Lok. She found a location, hired a core team of community health professionals and began to create an adult day center. Halfway through that first demonstration, a data-oriented researcher joined the effort. That researcher interviewed the management and clinical team to identify the questions and measures of success and started collecting and organizing data on the people served, their levels of need, the services they were given, and their outcomes. As that first demonstration was finishing, the executive director asked the researcher to use that data and the lessons learned to write a proposal for funding the next step. The data collected showed: 1) that many of the people served were eligible for skilled nursing care, and 2) the day health center needed to be part of a larger community care system including social day care, in-home services, and housing. The proposal expanded the service model to address these concerns.Adult Day Health Services, from Demonstration to PermanenceThat second demonstration was funded. A social day center and in-home services were added and a housing funding drive launched. The primary focus, however, was the refinement and more permanent funding of Adult Day Health Services (ADHS). Assessment data was used to identify those participants who were nursing home eligible. The less impaired went to the new social day center.Data systems were refined to collect data on the nursing and therapy services received in the Adult Day Health Care (ADHC), the changes in level of care, and the cost of the ADHC services. Using that data, discussions were held with the California Department of Health Services (DHS) to make ADHS reimbursable under Medicaid.Daily rate funding was significant because it eliminated the need and extra cost of traditional fee-for-service billing.The researcher worked with DHS to study On Loks ADHS program. State staff certified the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) eligibility of the participants served. Data was collected on the services participants received, participant satisfaction, and costs. The study found that ADHS participants received more professional and supportive services, at a lower cost, and were happier with the services they received.Based on the data, On Lok worked with DHS to fund On Loks ADHS as a new service under Medicaid. On Loks cost data was used to calculate a single daily rate for all services provided by the ADHS. Daily rate funding was significant because it eliminated the need and extra cost of traditional fee-for-service billing and allowed clinical staff to do what was needed.The DHSOn Lok Medicaid ADHS demonstration was approved. A few years later the demonstration was expanded to include other sites across the state. The data collection systems developed at On Lok were adapted and used by the state for the operation and management of this growing program. A few years later ADHC became a permanent California Medicaid long-term care (LTC) service and has served as a prototype for Medicaid Adult Day Services programs in other states (Zawadski & Ansak, 1983).ADHS to PACEExpanding the Integrated Service ModelWhile ADHS was evolving into a permanent Medicaid service, On Lok evaluated its second demonstration to see how it could be improved. The evaluation found that other community services were helpful but needed to be coordinated with ADHS. Moreover, it found that Medical services were inexorably intertwined with long-term care services and they both needed to be integrated. Guided by these findings, On Loks research team proposed a third demonstration, a Community Care Organization for Disabled Adults (CCODA) that would integrate all servicesmedical, social, and supportiveneeded by a long-term careeligible person (Zawadski & Ansak, 1983).That third demonstration was funded by the federal Office of Human Development Services. That demonstration allowed On Lok to hire primary care physicians, contract with medical specialists, and manage and control acute and long-term care admissions. In talking with policy makers, federal and state health administrators, and legislators, it became clear that while keeping people out of nursing homes and providing higher quality care in the community was admirable, containing or reducing health and long-term care costs was paramount.Data collection was expanded to include Medicare measures of acuity, compatible tracking of medical services, inpatient days (acute and SNF), and their costs. The data showed that integrated community services reduced acute admissions and length of stay and almost eliminated SNF days (Zawadski et al., 1985). These medical care savings more than covered the cost of the expanded community care services.Based on these findings, it was proposed to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that Medicare and Medicaid fund On Loks CCODA for its full package of services on a capitation basis like an HMO. The research team expanded the data-collection system to include medical information used by Medicare and contracted with a team from Brandeis University to analyze Medicare data to identify costs for beneficiaries with the disability level of the CCODA population. Average Medicare costs for that population was 2.39 times higher.Using that frailty cost adjuster for a Medicare capitation rate, the research team calculated Medicaids cost for the LTC portion. On Lok approached CMS offering to cover all of the services required by this LTC population for a risk-based fixed monthly capitation rate that was 5% lower than their current cost of care. CMS was interested and, because they felt it was high risk for a small organization, even agreed to a risk corridor around the rate. (Risk corridors limit risk to a small amount above or below the capitation rate with the funder [CMS] paying any costs above 105% and taking back any savings below 95%.)Useful service research needs to start in the trenches and be program based.An interesting aside, the state balked at the risk corridor and agreed to move forward only after On Lok agreed to take full risk and the community leaders and On Lok executive director agreed to use their homes to backstop any losses to the State of California. That was a demonstration of extraordinary leadership commitment to their community and confidence in the dataand provided a big implicit incentive to manage costs well.With that, PACE was born. On Loks CCODA operated successfully with this capitation reimbursement for a few years and was able to use the savings it achieved from better service management to build a reserve. On Loks R&D team, realizing that one sites success was not sufficient to create the policy change needed to ensure the programs funding permanence, approached and received funding from a group of national foundations to fund the development of replication sites across the country. CCODA was renamed PACE. A number of these replication sites were successful and spawned other sites. With successful replications in multiple states, federal legislation was eventually passed to make PACE a permanent program and allowing states to include it in their state plan.Lessons LearnedValue of Program-based, Policy-oriented ResearchInformation Can Improve ServicesManagement theorist Peter Drucker (1967) said, What is measured, improves. This is especially true in the delivery of health services. Meaningful service research builds upon data collection that addresses critical questions and shares the data effectively to guide change. Successful businesses have used data for Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI). The CQI concept, learning from each demonstration what worked and what didnt, was key to the development of PACE and can be used to continually improve program quality and effectiveness.Bottoms UpValue of Program-Based ResearchToo often data collection is mandated by external sources like funder reporting requirements and research project needs. Staff who collect that data often do not know why or see its benefits. Useful service research needs to start in the trenches and be program based. Program staff, both management and clinical, need to be involved. Those delivering the services evolving the model need to identify the important issues and questions and provide input into the measures tracked. Equally important, the collected data needs to be shared with those staff if it is to help guide program change.In the early days of On Lok, nurses were asked to record their services. After a month or two the data, showing four to five services per day, were shared back. The nurses were shocked that their data was actually being used. Service counts tripled in the following month.Politically AwareBenefits of Being Policy-OrientedTo effect change, health services research needs to be plugged in and aware of the factors that influence policy decision-making. While On Lok wanted to develop a service system that helped its community elders receive better services while staying in their homes, they recognized that the policymakers were inevitably concerned about costs. Embedding the concerns of policymakers in the research plan and collecting the necessary data across sites made policy change possible.ConclusionFrom a Small Acorn a Large Oak GrowsIn 2024 Medicare and Medicaid will spend more than $6 billion dollars on PACE capitation payments. Venture groups have raised billions more to invest in expanding this program to new sites and new states. This large and rapidly growing policy initiative known as PACE all started from the commitment of a small group of local community health professionals, led by a hard driving, problem-solving social worker turned director, all of whom used research to guide and help actualize the models development.Increasingly powerful computer technology has enabled more powerful models of using data, e.g., AI, or Artificial Intelligence. These models provide more powerful tools for using information to improve health services. That benefit will be enhanced if these new tools are used as part of a program-based and policy-oriented ongoing research effort. Research data was critical to the development of PACE, but it can offer even greater ongoing benefits as part of a Continuous Quality Improvement program supporting improved clinical decision-making and guiding future program and policy change.Rick T. Zawadski, PhD, joined On Lok in 1974 as research and development director, and over 15 years designed and helped develop On Lok's service model and financing systems from its first Adult Day Center thru the PACE Replication and built the information system to help manage and study these innovations. He went on to found RTZ Associates to integrate these services in County systems and create enterprise information systems to manage and improve these programs.Jennie Chin Hansen RN, MSN, FAAN, came to On Lok in 1980 to work in research for Rick and continued for nearly 25 years, serving more than 10 years as its CEO, working in operations, replication of the model, andadvancing the PACEfederal legislation. Chin Hansen also served asCEO of the American Geriatrics Society, president of AARP, consulted on a San Francisco initiative to develop Geriatric Emergency Departments, and was a stakeholder to Californias Department of Health and Human Services involved in developing its first ever Master Plan for Aging.Photo caption: Elders at On Lok engaged in a bowling game.Photo credit: Courtesy of On Lok, 2019.ReferencesDrucker, P.

While disappointing, we saw it as an opportunity to learn and further innovate and move the field of complex care forward. This article highlights positive results learned through additional secondary analysis, as well as challenges confronted by community-based organizations (CBOs) endeavoring to conduct rigorous program evaluation and our strategies for addressing those challenges, including investment in internal data capacity and research partnerships.Key Words:complex health needs, randomized controlled trials, academic-CBO partnerships, community-based care management, value-based care, patient-engaged researchThe null effect finding in the randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Camden Coalitions signature care-management intervention, the Camden Core Model, was a significant moment for the organization, prompting reflection on the challenges of supporting and evaluating our work for patients with complex health and social needs (Finkelstein et al., 2020).The finding was disappointing, but we did not steer away from widely disseminating the result and engaging partners and stakeholders in dialogue around it. We saw it as an opportunity to learn and further innovate, and to move the field forward toward more effective solutions.This mindset drove the Coalition to publish two secondary analyses that found that higher intervention dosage (Wiest et al., 2023) and engagement (Yang et al., 2023) were associated with lower readmission rates, and to partner again with MITs Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) to publish a new analysis looking at intermediate measures of care coordination, like connection to primary and specialty outpatient care (Finkelstein et al., 2023). Central to this continued learning has been a combination of internal data capacity investment and cultivating effective research partnerships. This article reflects on our lessons learned moving forward from the initial RCT findings.Camden Core Model and Lead Up to the RCTThe Camden Core Model, one of the Camden Coalitions first initiatives, is aimed at providing critical supports to patients with complex health and social needs. The Core Models interdisciplinary care teams provide high-touch, time-limited (roughly 90 days on average) care management and care coordination, including home/community visits and accompaniment to appointments, to high-risk patients transitioning from the hospital back to the community. Through a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation grant, the Camden Coalition began scaling up the program in 2013 and had a stable, multiyear funding window. As the Affordable Care Act and other policy shifts promoted a proliferation in value-based payment models, there continued to be significant interest in evaluating programs like the Camden Core Model. Recognizing that there were significantly more patients who were eligible than we could support, the Camden Coalition decided to partner with J-PAL North America to implement a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the programs impact on hospital readmissions.Measure What Matters to Program ParticipantsAbout 2 weeks after the original RCT was published, we discussed the null effect of the model on hospital readmissions with our Community Advisory Committee (CAC). The CAC consists of former program participants and residents invested in improving the well-being of the South Jersey community. It was a humbling experience to share the findings with this group: they are a committee of our Board of Trustees and many of them were graduates of the program. They were underwhelmed with both the study and its conclusions, especially with what we chose to measure.One member said, You were obviously asking the wrong question, and another added, Did you ask them if they were going to meetings, or visiting family? I knew I was getting better when I did that.We would not embark on another RCT without also measuring what our patients care about.Those were questions we had not asked. In our quest to demonstrate that we could both do whats right for our patients and reduce spending, we put such a high premium on hospital readmissions that we overlooked other crucial aspects of value. The RCT was constrained by time and resources. We also did not want to place undue burden on our staff and patients by expanding data collection efforts and the study time frame to achieve the sample size required to address a wider range of questions. While we cant say we have given up on measures like readmissions and cost of care, we would not embark on another RCT without also measuring what our patients care about.Prioritize Study ReadinessThe Camden Coalitions care-management model received increased attention following a 2011 New Yorker article by Atul Gawande. As resources followed, our program grew exponentially. Further, with the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act around the same time, the health policy world was hungry for answers, and new funding was available through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. All of this pushed us to move more quickly than we were ready to. In hindsight, we knew our program was still maturing and developing know-how about effectively supporting patients at scale.We have no regrets about participating in the RCT, as the Coalition and the field have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge from it. When we decide to do another RCT, however, we will take time to lay a solid foundation for it, similar to how medical and drug trials go through many phases before the ultimate clinical trial to determine efficacy or effectiveness. We are working to answer some key questions first, including which patients are most likely to benefit, how to define and measure implementation fidelity and dosage, and which outcomes are most appropriate and achievable for patients.Plan for Post-Study LearningThe Coalition did not have a pre-existing plan on what to do once the study findings were published. We also were not funded to engage in post-RCT analyses except for some limited funding to maintain data, IRB agreements, and other study management support. Despite this, we wanted to capitalize on the clean RCT data set for quality improvement purposes and to examine the possibility that the model effectively reduced readmissions for certain subsets of patients or achieved other benefits.The decision to re-analyze the data resulted in important knowledge. In a follow-up analysis recently published inHealth Affairs, we worked with researchers affiliated with J-PAL North America and the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy to study broader healthcare utilization measures and additional value streams for complex-care programs. With access to Medicaid claims data, we demonstrated that our program significantly increased connections to primary and specialty care, as well as access to Durable Medical Equipment (DME; Finkelstein et al., 2023).Alongside an earlier finding of increased SNAP uptake, these outcomes highlight the impact our teams had on patients daily lives. Access to durable medical equipment (e.g. oxygen supplies, wheelchairs), food stamps, or a primary care or specialty physician improves peoples lives in ways that are not fully captured by measuring readmissions across an entire patient panel.In addition to theHealth Affairsfindings, our team collaborated with researchers at Kaiser Permanente to explore how varying intervention-participation levels may have affected our results. In some instances, our care team dedicated at least 100 hours working with a single client across several months, whereas, in other cases, the team struggled to even complete the initial home visit (Martinez et al., 2019).Forging strong relationships with outside researchers has been a critical strategy.The average impact across patients with differing levels of intervention engagement does not tell the full story. In a recentJAMA Network Openpublication, we applied a novel and robust methodology developed by our Kaiser Permanente partners (Adams et al., 2022) to ask if the model was more effective for patients with greater engagement. Contrary to the earlier null result, we found that greater likelihood of participation was associated with significantly lower readmission rates, and that certain clinical and social characteristics were associated with varying degrees of intervention engagement.Moving forward, we could either: a) refine our inclusion criteria to identify those most likely to engage and benefit, or b) build strategies to better meet the circumstances and needs of participants who face engagement barriers. For example, patients with housing instability or recent criminal justice involvement had lower engagement levels. Even prior to the findings, the day-to-day experiences of our care teams identified the inherent difficulties of building relationships, maintaining contact, and providing all the necessary supports for patients with legal and housing concerns.This led us to develop two powerful new add-ons to our model: a Housing First program that provides housing vouchers and longer-term support, and a Medical Legal Partnership that allows lawyers to work hand-in-hand with the care team to remedy any legal concerns of the patient. As we look to the future, we will continue to find opportunities to strengthen our ecosystem of care and support the complex care workforce so that our participants can access the services they need.Identify Long-Term Research PartnersAt the Camden Coalition, we have long recognized that community-based organizations (CBOs) cannot simply delegate their program evaluation to external researchers; they must build internal data capacity through investments in data infrastructure and skilled data staff who can steer the ship, identify research and evaluation priorities, ensure program readiness, and build research partnerships. Unfortunately, it is rare that organizations like ours have access to funding streams for investments in data infrastructure and data analysis beyond program evaluation. While funders are keen to support RCTs, they often overlook the preparatory groundwork needed for a CBO to successfully implement an RCT, or the subsequent analysis necessary to further shed light on initial findings. Consequently, much of our post-RCT work has been self-funded.Forging strong relationships with outside researchers has been a critical strategy. Over the years we have been privileged to partner with a talented group of researchers, including MITs J-PAL, Rutgers Center for State Health Policy, Kaiser Permanente, the University of Massachusetts, and PolicyLab at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. We are often approached by more researchers than we have the capacity to work with at any given moment, and when we decide who to partner with, we ask ourselves the following questions:Whose research expertise most aligns with our internal values and priorities?Is the researcher looking for a one-off project or are they looking for longer-term engagement?What is the researchers history in the community? Have they demonstrated the ability to gain trust with program participants and community stakeholders? Do they have a history of engagement and cultural competency with the populations we work with?Is the researcher willing to adapt and evolve their thinking alongside our team?Does the researcher see us as true partners and collaborators, rather than as conduits to the populations and data they need to pursue their research ambitions?Our research partners often work with us based on the funding we have available for evaluation or research, and this rarely covers the true cost of their work. We are grateful they are willing to do this, but would prefer research funds to be more easily available to CBOs, especially during the critical early stages of evaluation that are needed to prepare for larger studies.Going ForwardThe Camden Coalition will continue its research and evaluation work, both for its Camden Core Model as well as its broader portfolio of demonstration projects. Working with a researcher at the University of Massachusetts, we received a National Science Foundation grant to conduct another secondary analysis of the RCT study population to refine our understanding of patient subgroups. Weve partnered with the Walter Rand Institute at Rutgers UniversityCamden to conduct a mixed methods evaluation of our Medical Legal Partnership, and we are conducting an internal evaluation of our Pledge to Connect program that connects individuals with recent mental healthrelated emergency department encounters to outpatient behavioral health providers. With each of these efforts, we hope to replicate the learning process articulated in this article and continue to grow the evidence base for complex care. We look forward to continuing to learn from and share more with the field.Aaron Truchil, MS, is senior director of Analytics at the Camden Coalition Camden, NJ.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2024How Do Foundations and Funders Approach Evaluation and Impact?By Amy R. EisensteinJune 26, 2024TagsInnovation & Social ImpactHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureAbstract:Evaluation and impact are two words many of us use daily. But what do they mean and how can they improve our work? As a funder, evaluation plans are an integral component of all proposals we review. This article explains why evaluations are so important to funders and what we look for in an evaluation; it will provide perspective on opportunities to shift your mindset to adopt a culture of evaluation in your organization.Keywords:evaluation, impact, philanthropy, funding, equitable evaluationWhen I was a doctoral student, I was invited to attend a Grantmakers in Aging conference. What struck me most were the number of sessions focused on evaluation. Topics included what to look for in a strong evaluation, why evaluation is so important, and how to share lessons learned with trustees and partners. Prior to that, I hadnt given much thought to the relevance and importance of evaluation to the funder, and how they might use that information. Ive been intrigued to learn about evaluation and impact from a funders perspective ever since, and am glad to work at a foundation where I can further reflect upon the use of evaluative information and how it benefits collaborative efforts to improve quality of life for all of us as we age.A Bit of Background: Focus on EvaluationWriters of grant proposals for funding are routinely asked to incorporate an evaluation of the work into the proposal. Whether submitting a proposal for direct service work, research, advocacy, or any other type of support, some element of evaluation is unavoidable.Usually, when people hear evaluation, they think of the standard outcome evaluation, which focuses on determining whether a program improves one or more targeted outcomes for those served. But not all evaluations look or feel the same. The textbook definition of evaluation is, The systematic collection of information about the activities, characteristics, and outcomes of programs to make judgments about the program, improve program effectiveness, and/or inform decisions about future program development (Patton & Campbell-Patton, 2008, p. 39).There are several types of evaluation beyond outcome evaluation, including process and implementation evaluation, and formative and summative evaluation. Outcome evaluation is generally used when an applicant is testing the effects of programs that are innovative, replicable, and shown to be feasible.Process evaluations focus on how a program operates, incorporating descriptive information about clients and staff, the nature of services offered, methods of delivery, and patterns of service use. Process evaluation generates a blueprint of a program in action. Effective process evaluations allow applicants to explain how funds are used, provide a guide to others wishing to replicate the work, and describe the program or intervention. Implementation evaluation focuses on the practical lessons that emerge when activating a new project. A project rarely goes off without a hitch; lessons learned during implementation help organizations identify whether an approach may need to be modified and, if so, how to modify the approach effectively (RRF Foundation for Aging, n.d.).The type of evaluation used depends upon the project or the type of work being conducted. It is important to recognize that a strong evaluation does not have to be time-consuming or expensive. Evaluations can run the gamut of rigor, with more rigorous evaluations (implemented through experimental research designs) being more expensive; quasi-experimental and non-experimental designs (such as observational or pre/post-tests) also can be of benefit in understanding the plans, process, and outcomes of the work.A Bit of Background: Focus on ImpactI see evaluation as a tool to help understand whether the work aids progress toward social impact, health equity, social justice, and/or social change. As a graduate student, many of the traditional evaluation frameworks I was taught didnt resonate with me. Sure, they helped us understand whether the objectives were being met, but if the objectives werent well written, the evaluation would have no chance of helping to determine impact. When I started work as a researcher in the field, in addition to applying traditional evaluation frameworks, I focused on the role a colleague had suggested, that of a creative evaluator. With this concept in mind, I strived to think creatively, to figure out ways to quantitatively or qualitatively understand whether the work my team was doing was progressing toward that elusive term, impact. Afterall, if our work wasnt impactful, why were we doing it?When I started working for a foundation, I brought this concept of creative evaluation with me, and brainstormed with my team to understand why we ask grantee partners to evaluate their work and how we use that information. In accordance with best practices and trust-based philanthropy, our goal as a funder is to approach relationships with grantee partners from a place of trust and collaboration rather than compliance and control (Trust-Based Philanthropy Project, n.d.). One of the practices of trust-based philanthropy is streamlined reporting, which means not requiring grantee partners to submit cumbersome reports that will not be used in any significant way by the funder. So, why request that grantee partners complete evaluations?A strong evaluation does not have to be time-consuming or expensive.Our job is to identify and support work that has the greatest potential for high impact within the foundations interests, while advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. We are a mid-size funder with a relatively fixed amount of funding we can dedicate each year to our mission of improving quality of life for all of us as we age. We are constantly trying to learn and understand what elements will help us achieve our mission, and without evaluative information we have no way of knowing the impact of our philanthropic dollars.As explained by the Council on Foundations (n.d.), evaluations help foundations understand the quality or impact of funded programs, plan and implement new programs, make future grant decisions, and demonstrate accountability to those managing the foundation (i.e., the public trust, or trustees of the board).At RRF Foundation for Aging, we promote evaluation as part of every grant to:Encourage applicants and grantees to become more effective learning organizations by gathering and systematically analyzing important client and program information about the nature, reach, quality, and efficiency of the services they provide;Enable the foundation to better understand the value of the investments we make and the lessons that funded projects can teach us about how to invest our grant dollars more effectively in the future; andAdd to knowledge in the field about best practices in services for older adults by supporting, when appropriate, rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental outcome studies.Our hope is to foster a culture of evaluation in the organizations with which we partner. Organizations with a culture of evaluation deliberately and actively seek evidence to better design and deliver programs (Stewart, 2014).Important Elements to Include in Any EvaluationWhen planning an evaluation, certain elements need to be considered and incorporated into the plan. First, evaluation must be part of the conversation from the beginning. It is difficult to begin thinking through evaluation after a program has already been planned, or worse yet, already implemented. If bringing in an external evaluator, it is important to clearly articulate program goals and objectives to the evaluator so all are on the same page regarding what is being evaluated and expected outcomes.A strong evaluation will start with the basics, asking key questions such as, what aspects of the program are most effective? What do clients or patients like best about the program? How many sessions are needed to achieve results? Next, it is crucial to ask whether the question really needs an answer, and whether it is ethical and feasible to measure the result.When planning an evaluation I always recommend starting with a logic modela logical depiction of the inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes of a projectand working backward. In evaluation one must define the desired outcome first, and then think about how to measure it. Next, one must determine what indicator will be used to assess the outcome, where that indicator can be found, and how to collect and store information about the indicator.For instance, when planning an intergenerational program or intervention, one starts with the desired primary outcomeperhaps fostering intergenerational connections or reducing loneliness. Although there could be more than one outcome, it is key to be intentional about the desired primary outcome. Next, one must determine which indicator to use to assess the outcome, where that indicator can be found, and how to collect and store information about it.In the example above, if implementing a program to reduce loneliness, one must determine how to conceptualize lonelinessis it a self-reported measure of perceived loneliness? If thats the case, one might opt to use the DeJong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, which measures emotional and social loneliness, or The Campaign to End Loneliness Measurement tool designed to understand a persons experience of loneliness (Campaign to End Loneliness, n.d.). There are many measurement tools for constructs in the social sciences available. The Foundation for Social Connection has created an inventoryhere. Also, for a comprehensive database of physical, mental, and social health measures and other patient-reported outcome measures, theres the HealthMeasureswebsite.We frequently see proposals submitted that focus on ideal, not actual populations.After a measure has been selected, evaluators must define who will collect the data, how they will collect it, where it will be stored, and who will analyze it. Data can be collected via interview or survey format. In either case, it is important to consider how to make it most accessible for all. Some examples include using large font for surveys, ensuring surveys are available in multiple languages, or making non-program staff available to conduct the survey as an interview format.An additional element to consider is the samplewho will be included, and do they represent the population to be targeted by a program or intervention? We frequently see proposals submitted that focus on ideals, not actual populations. For instance, proposals that plan to reduce loneliness using a pre-post evaluation of a sample with low loneliness rates at baseline.Considerations for Equitable EvaluationIt also is critical for evaluation to be grounded in advancing equity, meaning the way an applicant conceptualizes outcomes, chooses variables of interest, and designs the evaluation process must draw from the needs and expertise of diverse community stakeholders (Equitable Evaluation Initiative, n.d.). Evaluation should be designed and implemented with multicultural validity, and it should consider the effects of a strategy on different populations and on the underlying systemic drivers of inequity. It is important to remember that if we are not designing intentionally for equity, we are exacerbating it.Additional questions regarding equity that evaluations should consider include: Who benefits most and least from the program/intervention? What assumptions were made? What might be some intended or unintended consequences? And how well does this program/intervention reflect the values, needs, and goals of the community? Engage stakeholders in the evaluation process, and dont shy away from their constructive criticism and concerns. From personal experience, Ive learned it will only strengthen the work.What Makes a Project Have Potential for Impact?Most foundations want to spur social change; for example, at RRF Foundation for Aging, our mission is to improve quality of life for older adults. Our board often questions how we know the work we fund is helping to achieve our mission. Unfortunately, individual evaluations of a diverse group of projects will not provide sufficient information for us to fully gauge the answer to that question. Therefore, when proposals come in, beyond reviewing for strong evaluations, we also assess how they fit into the ecosystem of our other work and ask whether a proposal has a high potential for impact.Impact is one of the core values at RRF Foundation for Aging. We recognize impact is accomplished by investing in effective organizations, sound program models, and strong policies. To live this value, RRF takes an approach as a learning organization with the goal of identifying the conditions under which we can award new grants that will have the greatest chance of impact. Identifying essential criteria allows us to improve our selection of projects for funding.We assess for impact on individuals, on organizations, on communities, or on the field, depending upon the type of project. For example, in direct service projects, the work needs to have significant impact on the parties it serves, or on the ability of the organization to provide service.Weve learned that successful direct service projects are designed in response to a specific, demonstrated interest, need, and/or demand from the target population; they are designed and implemented in collaboration with other partnering organizations; they do not duplicate existing projects or parallel efforts; and they incorporate appropriate DEI considerations and cultural competencies.When it comes to research, we note where it will take the field and what will result. Effective research projects focus on applied research with an actionable plan to apply findings to current practice. They have rigorous research methods, collaborative investigative teams, and build upon the most current knowledge.Advocacy projects that achieve impact tend to target a specific issue, such as rising debt in older adults, take advantage of momentum and good timing, and involve collaboration with an appropriate mix of partners. Effective training projects start with the ability to demonstrate evidence of trainee desire and demand, involve interactive teaching methods to maximize learning, use technology in appropriate and seamless ways, and incorporate strategies for trainees to deepen their ability to apply what theyve learned in the future.ConclusionEvaluation should not be considered an academic exercise. It is a necessary process to help achieve impact. While not all projects need an elaborate randomized controlled trial, it is important to obtain some level of data so that we can learn what works and where there are opportunities for improvement. At RRF Foundation for Aging, our hope is that implementing a brief reporting process that reflects program evaluation will help us understand a projects impact and lessons learned, while also helping the project team reflect on progress made during the grant period. My hope is that organizations and researchers will shift their mindsets toward a culture of evaluation, in which qualitative and quantitative data are collected and organizations consider a mix of evidence to make informed decisions and improve their work.Amy R.

More recently, research has informed the development of a value-based payment model to disseminate HaH. The COVID-19 pandemic enabled regulatory changes leading to the enactment of a payment for HaH in the Medicare program, the Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCAH) waiver. This article highlights the crucial role of health policy research in advancing HaH and its role in enabling AHCAH before discussing ongoing research that will guide the future of HaH.Key Words:Hospital at Home (HaH), Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCAH), payment policyThe Hospital at Home (HaH) ModelWithin weeks of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted a set of regulatory relief measures expanding where and how hospitals could care for acutely ill patients (CMS, 2020a). By November 2020, CMS expanded the scope of these measures to allow hospital-level care to be provided in a patients home (CMS, 2020b). This initiative, Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCAH; Clark et al., 2021), was a deft response to the urgency of the pandemic. Since the enactment of AHCAH, thousands of patients nationwide have received safe, high-quality Hospital at Home (HaH) care (Levine et al., 2024).HaH provides hospital-level care in a patients home as a substitute for traditional inpatient treatment. The model was developed by geriatricians concerned about the iatrogenic harms of inpatient hospitalization (e.g., falls, delirium, etc.), hypothesizing that providing care in patients usual environment would improve outcomes. All HaH models provide core inpatient services and cover patients 24/7: physician and nurse practitioner care (in-person or virtual), in-person nursing care, on-demand care team support, pharmacy, and allied services (e.g., physical and occupational therapy), in-home therapeutics (e.g., intravenous medications and fluids, respiratory therapies), diagnostics (e.g., X-rays), and established protocols for transferring to an inpatient facility if needed.To be clear, AHCAH did not create HaH. Decades of health services research preceding the COVID-19 pandemic produced a robust evidence base supporting HaH. However, no CMS reimbursement mechanism existed to support broad HaH implementation. Regulatory and payment barriers for HaH were overcome when mitigating COVID-19 pressures (e.g., increasing hospital capacity while delivering high-quality, reliable acute care) became essential. But AHCAH would not have been possible without decades of effort to build the evidence base showing that HaH could deliver such care.This article identifies how research informed the development, validation, and iteration of the clinical HaH model and played an integral role in informing payment policy. A brief review of nearly 30 years of clinical researchand nearly a decade dedicated to elaborating a payment modeldemonstrates that at every step, research has and can continue to inform policy.The Evidence BaseThe first HaH pilot in the United States was published in 1999, building on foundational research to identify appropriate patients for HaH (Leff et al., 1997) and understand whether patients would accept HaH care (Burton et al., 1998). A case series feasibility study at an academic medical center of 17 patients demonstrated that HaH care could be provided safely and was acceptable to patients. This pilot also achieved high patient satisfaction and cost less than traditional inpatient care (Leff et al., 1999).Any model would need to be translatable to the Medicare context for health systems to rationalize investing in the upstart of HaH programs.Subsequent studies included multisite, prospective trials focused on beneficiaries of managed Medicare insurance plans and beneficiaries of the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system. Studies demonstrated HaH delivered high-quality care, acceptable to patients and family members, again with significantly lower costs (Leff et al., 2005). These findings were replicated in a regional health system for Medicare Advantage and Medicaid patients (Cryer et al., 2012). The VA has replicated these findings across other sites (Cai et al., 2017, 2018). Studies across multiple systems have continued to re-demonstrate findings that home-based acute care is high-quality, lower-cost, and satisfactory to patients (Arsenault-Lapierre et al., 2021; Caplan et al., 2012; Shepperd et al., 2016). Subsequent randomized controlled trials of HaH demonstrated similar positive findings associated with HaH care (Levine et al., 2019, 2021; Moss et al., 2024).Payment PolicyReimbursement for HaH has been debated since its emergence in the United States. Early demonstrations were grant-funded or operated in the Medicare managed care setting or the VA, whose capitated model allowed for investments in cost-saving programs. Despite international examples of favorable returns on investment for reimbursing HaH care the same as inpatient care (Montalto, 2010), no fee-for-service payment mechanism for home-based acute care existed in the United States. Questions about benchmarking HaH episode payments to traditional Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) rates, which incorporate overhead costs into reimbursements, remained open without a U.S.-specific evidence base.In 2014, researchers, in conjunction with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), sought to change this. Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai had been awarded a Health Care Innovation Award from CMMI to study the implementation of HaH in a multi-hospital health system. The work focused on advancing the HaH clinical model and developing data to inform future payment models for HaH in fee-for-service Medicare. In addition to tracking health utilization outcomes, researchers also set parameters to prevent potentially lower-cost cases (e.g., uncomplicated pneumonia) from being cherry-picked into the HaH arm of the study, proactively addressing a payment policy interest. The findings supported pursuing policy change that would enable HaH implementation broadly (Federman et al., 2018).Researchers also understood that study outcomes could inform the development of a value-based payment model acceptable to providers and payors. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2015 created the Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC), an advisory committee to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services focused on the evaluation of innovative payment models for potential adoption in the Medicare program. Seeking to advance HaH payment policy, the research team engaged with actuaries to design a payment model that would satisfy the interests of patients, providers, and payors (e.g., high-quality care, with appropriate compensation to support operation, at a lower total cost than traditional inpatient care). Importantly, any model would need to be translatable to the Medicare context for health systems to rationalize health systems investing in the upstart of HaH programs.The outcome of this actuarial process was a DRG-based bundled payment for acute care at home plus 30-day post-acute follow-up care (CMS, n.d.). To address questions of appropriate reimbursement, the payment model design included both a 5% reduction in the prospective DRG payment, as well as inclusion of a 30-day, post-acute transition episode composed of in-person and telehealth follow-up into the bundled payment. Supported by the evidence of improved outcomes for patients and a favorable assessment of the DRG-based payment model, PTAC (2017) recommended full implementation of the alternate payment model for HaH across the United States in the fall of 2017.Starting the ConversationThe PTAC recommendation for nationwide implementation did not automatically translate into Medicare adoption. First referred by PTAC to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the recommendation was then shared with CMS for determination of how to proceed. Both the body of research and the PTAC-approved alternate payment model proposal started a conversation with CMS about numerous practical considerations for implementing HaH.More work developing technical assistance tools to enhance family caregivers experience is needed to ensure they are prepared for having a loved one cared for in HaH.Discussions with CMS involved examining the specific diagnoses treated and services rendered during the Mount Sinai trial to inform which payment rates would be appropriate. Regulators were weighing the costs of delivering HaH care against potential savings to Medicare. At the same time, HaH programs negotiated contracts with commercial payors to maintain patient volume to justify its existence.Discussions with CMS stalled, only to be accelerated by the exigency of the pandemic. AHCAH is, truly, the product of years of discussion and problem-solving with policymakers, from PTAC approval in the fall of 2017 through the waiver announcement in November 2020.Looking ForwardA growing body of literature analyzing the AHCAH waiver program has underscored the safety of disseminating HaH to hundreds of hospitals nationally without unforeseen consequences. ACHAH-participating health systems have achieved low mortality, low rates of escalation to facility-based inpatient care, and low admission rates to skilled nursing facilities following HaH discharge (Adams et al., 2023). The AHCAH program was reviewed by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) in the spring of 2024 with recommendations pending (MedPAC, 2024).To be sure, there is more research that must be conducted to answer further clinical and policy-related questions (Leff et al., 2022). Importantly, research to date has demonstrated that HaH has been able to provide person-centered care for socially vulnerable populations, including patients of minority racial or ethnic backgrounds, persons with dementia, and dually eligible beneficiaries (Levine et al., 2024). This builds on prior research examining the equitable provision of HaH to patients of lower socioeconomic status (Augustine et al., 2021; Baim-Lance et al., 2023; Siu et al., 2022). Further research should assess equitable provision in a variety of clinical contexts, to allay policymaker concerns related to health equity.Although prior research demonstrates that the care experience of family caregivers of HaH patients is better and less stressful than traditional hospital care, additional research is needed to determine how to optimize the experience of family caregivers in the context of HaH. Under AHCAH, HaH programs cannot enlist family members to perform medical duties.Additional work on developing technical assistance tools to enhance the experience of family caregivers is needed to ensure family members are appropriately prepared for having a loved one cared for in HaH. Furthermore, the many permutations of HaH care that developed during the AHCAH waiver program should be evaluated side-by-side, including an assessment of telehealths role in creating optimally safe and efficient models of care (Levine et al., 2022).Outstanding research questions about payment policy remain, too. The PTAC-recommended HaH alternate payment model included both a DRG discount and the inclusion of 30-day post-acute transitional care. The AHCAH waiver included neither of these provisions, instead reimbursing HaH care at inpatient DRG rates. Economic evaluations must evenhandedly compare these approaches to determine future directions.The AHCAH waiver is set to expire Dec. 31, 2024, and will require Congressional action to be extended. While hospitals continue to obtain AHCAH waivers from CMS, the rate of uptake has slowed in the face of policy uncertainty and as the worst of pandemic-related pressures on hospital beds have eased. Policymakers should once again look to the research that underpins the Hospital Without Walls programas well as the evidence emerging from the waiver program showing a safe and effective rollout nationally.Robert M.

Several states have developed data-collection initiatives and evaluations to better understand how their programs can be modified to best support caregivers and care recipients. This article highlights examples of approaches to family caregiver data collection and research at the state level.Key Words:caregiving, data, family caregivers, caregiving policy, long-term careAs the population of older adults and people living with disabilities continues to grow, states are thinking creatively about how they can better leverage data and analytics to strengthen long-term care systems, including services that support care recipients and their family caregivers. Family caregivers are a primary source of long-term services and supports (LTSS), with Reinhard et al. (2023a) estimating that in 2021 unpaid caregivers provided approximately $600 billion worth of care. To better support family caregivers and care recipients, states can collect data on family caregiver programs and caregivers to better understand which populations programs are reaching, identify what gaps in services exist, and conduct evaluations to understand how to improve programs and policy.In 2022, the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage (RAISE) Act Family Caregiving Advisory Council and the Advisory Council to Support Grandparents Raising Grandchildren released the National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers to help accelerate the adoption of a comprehensive system to support family caregivers. This strategy provides a framework for states and other organizations to use in developing and advancing family caregiver supports, including recommendations for states and other organizations to help promote family caregiver research, data collection, and evaluation.The recommendations include:administer the Caregiver Module of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [BRFSS],adopt caregiver assessments that are evidence-based or evidence-informed and track outcomes to determine future resource needs and programming gaps,adopt the use of data sets with national-level caregiving data,compile inventories of family caregiver services at the state level, andconduct evaluations of family caregiving programs.Although data is key to informing and sustaining programs, systematic data collection and research on state family caregiving initiatives are limited. Dedicated funding streams for program evaluation are uncommon, and often states may not have the staff capacity and expertise to frequently conduct rigorous impact studies. Yet, this research can be particularly important to demonstrating the value and effectiveness of these policies. Policymakers especially need data and evaluations to better understand programs cost effectiveness and return on investment, which can help inform and secure future funding for services.Despite these challenges, states and other organizations have taken a range of approaches in developing research and data-collection efforts to understand the overall impact of programs, identify gaps in services, and develop new policies and programs to address the needs of care recipients and their caregivers.How Do States Support Research and Evaluation Activities?States have used partnerships with external organizations, grants, and legislation to support data collection and research. For example, some states such as California have collaborated with universities and researchers to conduct targeted evaluations to inform the development of evidence-based programs and policies to support family caregivers.Californias Family Caregiver Alliance partnered with the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing at the University of California, Davis, to evaluate services provided by the states 11 Caregiver Resource Centers (CRCs). CRCs are nonprofit centers, funded by the California Department of Aging, that serve caregivers of people with debilitating cognitive conditions such as Alzheimers disease and traumatic brain injury.The Institute is conducting a California Department of Agingfunded evaluation of the implementation of CareNav in CRCs (Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing, n.d.). CareNav is an online platform designed to support family caregivers by providing access to the clients care plan, caregiver assessment, records of client encounters, and a caregiver resource library. The goal of CareNav is to improve family caregivers access to support and assistance outside of a clinical setting. In addition to providing valuable support to caregivers at their convenience, CRCs reported that CareNav was a useful tool for aggregating data across all CRCs to help evaluate services and inform future planning needs (Young et al., 2022).Using national datasets offers an opportunity to collect data to inform policy.Using national datasets offers another opportunity to collect data to inform policy. New York uses its Alzheimers Disease Assistance Fund to support the administration of the Caregiver and Cognitive modules of the CDCs BRFSS in the state (National Academy for State Health Policy, 2022). Data from these modules were analyzed and incorporated into state evaluation activities. A 2022 evaluation used caregiver demographic data to compare the demographics of caregivers reached within the states Alzheimers Disease Caregiver Support Initiative to the states population overall, and to national caregiver populations. This 2022 evaluation also followed up on an earlier initial evaluation from 2018, allowing for longitudinal comparisons of the program (Gallant & Riley-Jacome, 2022). These data sets provided an opportunity for the state to learn more about which populations the program reached; and can be used as baseline data for targeting outreach and services to reach diverse caregiver populations.Other approaches include collecting demographic data on currently available caregiver programs as a baseline to inform program implementation. The Texas legislature passed Senate Bill 271 in 2009, which added Section 161.079 to Texass Human Resources Code. This section required the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (2020) to analyze and report data to improve the states informal caregiver support services.The states report used Texas Caregiver Status Questionnaire (CSQ) and Caregiver Assessment Questionnaire (CAQ) as data sources. The report provided an overview of caregiver demographics in the state, including caregiver challenges, caregiver programs in the state, and plans for new caregiver services. Also, the report noted that the Commission uses data to inform policy on respite services and that the Commission identified gaps in respite services delivery by comparing available resources in the states respite inventory to the states regional needs.Washington State has collected more than 10 years worth of data on its family caregiver support programs, informing program development. Based on a legislative mandate, the outcomes of expanding the state-funded family caregiver support program were evaluated in the early 2010s. This evaluation found that the care recipients of caregivers in the program post-expansion showed, over an 18-month period, an estimated 20% lower likelihood of enrolling in Medicaid long-term care (Lavelle et al., 2014).In 2014, the state commissioned a report on the effectiveness of using the Tailored Caregiver Assessment and Referral (TCARE), an evidence-based assessment protocol, in the family caregiver support program. The report found evidence that those who completed the protocol and remained in the program for 6 months showed improved levels of caregiver mental health (Montgomery, 2014).Based on the findings of these evaluations and reports, Washington State incorporated two programs for unpaid caregivers and their care recipients, Medicaid Alternative Care (MAC) and Tailored Supports for Older Adults (TSOA), into the states Medicaid Transformation Project (MTP) 1115 waiver. These programs target individuals with LTSS needs who are not using Medicaid LTSS. MAC is for those who have a family caregiver and are eligible for Medicaid, and TSOA is for those who are at-risk of financially qualifying for Medicaid and do not necessarily have an informal caregiver. Medicaid 1115 waivers include an evaluation requirement, and an interim evaluation of the programs found slow enrollment, but high satisfaction and low usage of traditional LTSS within 6 months of enrollment in the program (Center for Health Systems Effectiveness, 2020).State data-collection efforts provide evidence to examine the effectiveness of family caregiving programs.Most recently, Washington State developed MTP 2.0, which includes expanded financial eligibility for the TSOA program (Washington State Health Care Authority, 2023). These ongoing data-collection efforts have provided an extensive basis of evidence to understand the effectiveness of the states family caregiving programs, and where programs can be adjusted or developed. This data can evaluate the estimated financial savings of using these programs, providing information for the state in determining how its programs and services can best be implemented to support more people and their caregivers.Many organizations also collect data and resources on family caregiving that states and others can use to inform policy considerations. For example, in 2023, AARP released its newest LTSS Scorecard, evaluating LTSS systems across all 50 U.S. states in five domains, including family caregiver supports. State policymakers and organizations can use the LTSS Scorecard to compare and contrast their states progress with other states and the national average across multiple metrics, such as nurse scope of practice, paid family leave, flexible sick days, and others. Because the scorecard contains multiple years of data, state policymakers can track development of some metrics over time.The 2023 scorecard reported slow state progress between 2020 and 2023 on supports for family caregivers, and that there are additional opportunities to build on innovative practices (Reinhard et al., 2023b). The LTSS Scorecard also tracks the number of states that have adopted Caregiver Advise, Record, and Enable (CARE) Act legislation. This legislation requires hospitals to identify a family caregiver in the medical record; inform them when discharge is to occur; and provide them with instruction and education on how to perform necessary medical tasks at home post-discharge. As of 2023, more than 40 states and the District of Columbia have enacted CARE legislation. States can continue to oversee the implementation of the Act by collecting data, such as via monitoring hospital quality and oversight activities (Reinhart et al., 2023b).ConclusionData collection, evaluation, and ongoing research is needed to better understand the value of family caregiving supports, and how caregiving programs can be refined to best meet the needs of people who require care, and their caregivers. The value of consistent data collection and targeted evaluations to inform the development of evidence-based policies to support family caregivers cannot be understated. The 2022 National Strategys recommendations provide states and other organizations with concrete steps they can take to strengthen their data collection efforts to aid in designing effective caregiving policies. These steps include but are not limited to using national caregiving-related data sets; and developing evaluations of current programs. Establishing a robust data collection infrastructure can help states address the evolving needs of recipients and caregivers.This article highlights some of the innovative ways state leaders are using data to enhance and modify caregiving programs. While challenges remain, by leveraging partnerships with external entities, grant funding opportunities, and certain legislative authorities, states can expand their capacity to fund future data collection and evaluation efforts.AcknowledgementThis article and the RAISE Act Family Caregiver Implementation and Technical Assistance Center at the National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP) were supported by The John A.

With an eye toward a more dynamic approach to understanding, developing, and using evidence, ACL recently funded its first ever Research, Demonstration, and Evaluation Center (ACL Innovation Lab). Drawing on research and the experience of the Aging Network, the Lab will focus on addressing gaps in the reach and relevance of interventions that prevent falls amongolder adults.Key Words:Administration for Community Living, disease-prevention, health-promotion, evidence-based programsAs is commonly known, the U.S. population is aging. By 2050, the U.S. Government projects that more than 100 million people will be ages 60 or older (U.S. Census Bureau, 2023). Roughly half of people ages 65 and older have at least one disability (Okoro et al., 2018), 81% have multiple chronic conditions (Buttorff et al., 2017), and one in four reports falling each year (Kakara, 2023).The Administration for Community Living (ACL) funds services and supports to older adults and people with disabilities to help them live well, in the communities of their choice, for as long as possible. A cornerstone for living independently is preventing and managing chronic conditions and preventing falls. In that regard, ACL strives to learn and improve upon the evidence for interventions to manage chronic conditions and prevent falls.ACL, like many organizations, has been continuously educating our staff to understand how evidence informs and drives efforts to achieve our mission. For nearly 4 decades, ACLs Administration on Aging (AoA) has funded the delivery of programs that support healthy lifestyles and promote healthy behaviors (ACL, 2023c).Since the early 2000s, the nationwide Aging Network, consisting of State Units on Aging, Area Agencies on Aging, community-based service providers, and tribal organizations, has been steadily moving toward wider implementation of disease-prevention and health-promotion programs that that have been proven to improve the health and well-being of older adults. In 2012, a formal requirement was added to the Older Americans Act (OAA) that all programs delivered using OAA health-promotion funding be evidence-based.In response to this requirement, ACL engaged a variety of constituents to help develop formal criteria for evidence-based programs (EBP) for health promotion. This definition and its associated criteria were informed by a review of the research, existing EBP registries, and information about health-promotion programs being successfully delivered via the Aging Network. As a resource for ACL health-promotion grantees and the public, ACL also funded the development of an Evidence-Based Program Review Process and listing of EBPs that meet ACL EBP criteria. Since 2017, EBPs delivered by ACL grantees and their partners have reached more than 4 million older adults and adults with disabilities (National Council on Aging & ACL, 2024).ACL engaged a variety of constituents to help develop formal criteria for evidence-based programs (EBP) for health promotion.Evidence is dynamic and changes over time, and the Aging Network has applied many lessons since the existing ACL EBP criteria for health promotion were developed. As our population ages, ACL wants to be responsive to people aging into OAA services, including evidence-based programs.ACL routinely connects with grantees, service providers, and partners in the Aging Network to understand how the network, service provision, and needs change over time. ACL recently commissioned four reports to capture and analyze successes, challenges, and opportunities with EBP delivery in the Aging Network (ACL, 2022, 2023b; NCOA, 2021, 2024). A brief summary of key findings from these reports is included below:The implementation of an ACL definition and criterion for, and continued investment in, EBP delivery and technical assistance has increased these programs reach within across the Aging Network.Many EBPs have expanded to include remote delivery options, which has enhanced program reach but comes with challenges.Older adults EBP interests and preferences are diverse, with an increasing number of older adults gravitating toward nonclassroom-based EBPs.Existing ACL-designated EBPs can be resource-intensive and difficult to sustain, and present challenges in maintaining fidelity, particularly for organizations with limited capacity and fewer resources.There has been a decrease in the number of EBPs approved through the ACL-supported EBP review process, and the process may not fully appreciate Indigenous knowledge or other types of evidence.Gaps remain in the availability of EPBs that are relevant and responsive to specific populations, such as Indigenous communities, non-English-speaking communities, and individuals living with behavioral health conditions.There is significant variability in the way evidence is defined and used across agencies, organizations, and programs.Collectively, these reports demonstrated that, while the Aging Network continues to make strides in building capacity for and delivering evidence-based programs with fidelity, gaps in EBP capacity and program reach persist, particularly for populations the OAA prioritizes.With an eye toward a more dynamic approach to understanding, developing, and using evidence for aging programs, ACL recently funded its first ever Research, Demonstration, and Evaluation Center, called the ACL Innovation Lab (the Lab), to conduct research, demonstrations, and evaluations pertaining to falls prevention among older adults.The Lab is not duplicating the depth of research on falls prevention; rather, the aim of the Lab is to take what the Aging Network has learned about implementing EBPs and fill a gap for communities that may never choose to implement an EBP.One responsibility of the Lab is to develop a taxonomy for falls-prevention research based on falls-prevention literature.The Lab has focused its efforts on testing a method to identify the most successful components from evidence-based programs and use those components to design more flexible, evidence-informed approaches to prevent falls among older adults. While the Lab is just embarking on this work, there is a deep knowledge from which to draw so that communities that want to implement and sustain falls prevention programs in the most evidence-informed ways may be able to do so. The Lab is building upon what the Aging Network has learned and using it to inform research and test methods to allow for a more sustainable approach for communities that may never be able to implement an EBP.The responsibilities of the Lab are to develop a taxonomy for falls-prevention research based on falls-prevention literature; develop a community-driven and community-based participatory-research process to test evidence-informed falls prevention interventions through sub-awards to community-based aging entities to understand and measure these interventions; provide in-depth technical assistance to potential and awarded organizations; and disseminate findings to the Aging Network (ACL, 2023b).EBP are a critical part of understanding what works, for whom, and under which circumstances (Bamberger et al., 2006). The decades of research and implementation experience in the Aging Network has uncovered the need, and opportunity, to explore flexible approaches to falls prevention in communities that cannot or may not choose to implement an EBP.Evidence and knowledge are gained incrementally, and the literature on falls-prevention interventions has taken decades to reach a point where the Lab can deconstruct EBPs to analyze the most successful components and test the Labs approaches. In essence, the Lab is building upon what the Aging Network and ACL have learned and attempting to fill a gap for communities that have differing needs and capacity for sustaining EBPs.As ACL and the research community learn more about the Labs approach, ACL will continuously monitor any impacts from the results of the Labs research that can inform a more inclusive approach to generating new evidence and learning to prevent falls in the Aging Network.Amanda Cash, DrPH, MPH, directs the Office of Performance and Evaluation at the Administration for Community Living, in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and acts as ACLs chief data officer.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2024Funding for Practiceresearch Partnerships: Its Elementary, My Dear WatsonBy Heather L. Menne and Salli J. BollinJune 26, 2024TagsInnovation & Social ImpactEconomic SecurityAbstract:While data are the cornerstone for any research endeavor, funding and resources are essential for collecting and analyzing that data. Practice organizations might use internal resources to support research, or they might apply for foundation- or government-sponsored grants. Applied research research about or directly impacting day-to-day practice and lifebenefits from practiceresearch partnerships. The value of a practiceresearch partnership is never-ending. These partnerships can lead to comprehensive, thoughtful approaches to research with data collection and analysis and proven outcome measuresall of which are critical elements of a strong case for funding.Key Words:data, funding, grants, infrastructure, practiceresearch partnershipI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Sherlock Holmes inA Study in ScarletOur favorite fictional detective was not thinking about aging-related data and research when he offered this piece of wisdom, but it is evident that he placed value on data. For aging service providers or researchers addressing questions related to aging, data are the cornerstone of any research endeavor.Whether data are driven by research or quality improvementnursing home quality metrics, staffing ratios, satisfaction with services, level of staff knowledgethey inform whether our theories or assumptions are correct. Organizations can use data in myriad ways, including program planning, annual budgeting, and researching existing services. Even at the federal level there is a growing emphasis on evidence-based policymaking, which uses data and study results to make decisions on the impact and effectiveness of programs (Government Accountability Office, 2023).Using the consistent and sound principles of research through study design, methods, data collection, and analysis provides impartiality that adds credibility and value to an organization or practice. Working with researchers to collect, analyze, and interpret data provides insightful and objective information, painting a detailed picture that otherwise would not be captured.Partnering with researchers to adapt evidence-based programs for older adults will help to evaluate the effectiveness and relevancy of the programs, and researchers also can help adapt and evaluate these programs to be culturally relevant to diverse populations.For example, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations (SAMHSA, 2022) guide,Adapting Evidence-Based Practices for Under-Resourced Populations, outlines seven steps to adapt programs for underserved populations based upon the theoretical frameworks and research studies. This guide also stresses the importance of data and of developing an understanding of the community to be served, identifies processes that incorporate research methods, and includes citations and program adaptations, such as an example of pilot-testing a program for older Chinese adults.Researchers have expertise with different techniques that can be applied to various scenarios to most accurately reflect subject matter from the perspectives of diverse populations, policies, and programs. Collecting data through a lens that examines diverse perspectives and reflects the unique attributes of a community leads to a more informed and relevant analysis. This data can then be used for a multitude of purposes such as measuring impact, informing stakeholders, meeting reporting requirements, strategic planning, and identifying future directions and funding.I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means. fromThe Complete Sherlock HolmesWhile it is not attributed to the distinguished detective, this quote still makes an important point. To conduct research with the necessary people, processes, and products, one needs money or related resources. Funding supports data collection, analysis, and planning for next steps. Grants through foundations and government entities can serve as initial, and ongoing, sources of funds to meet these needs. Some organizations might use these grant opportunities to partner with experts in research approaches or topics relevant to the project focus (i.e., subject matter experts).These outside experts might be able to lead grant applications or they may help build staff capacity and understanding about data, data-collection processes, analysis, and interpretation. Alternatively, organizations might be better suited to lead grant applications and include experts to fill gaps in organizational knowledge and experience (e.g., the need to capture demographic characteristics of participants, the value in using existing administrative data).Based upon experience and familiarity with funding and research, organizations newer to working with researchers may need to learn from and be mentored by others with experience. In some communities, a local community foundation or public library system may offer useful workshops or resources on topics such as identifying funding sources or grant writing.Likewise,Grants.govcontains information and resources to learn about grants and federal funding sources, such as a Grants 101 page and a Grant Terminology page (e.g., what is the difference between a cooperative agreement and a contract). Joining a foundations e-newsletter or subscribing to a state or federal grants government listserv can help one become familiar with and identify potential funding sources.Local or even national foundations can provide grants for initial studies of programs and services provided by community-based organizations.Philanthropy News Digestis one source for monitoring or searching for funding opportunities that cover a range of categories related to aging (e.g., health, human services). The federal government makes the public aware of funding opportunities through a few different mechanisms. For example, the main page ofGrants.Govconnects people to a robust search feature where applicants can filter opportunities by criteria such as keywords or funding agency.WhileGrants.Govcan point to funding opportunities for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Administration for Community Living, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and more, some other national funders require a visit to their home pages.The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)is an independent nonprofit that in 2010 was authorized by Congress. PCORI funds comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to make clinical research more patient-centered. Some advocacy organizations also fund research (e.g.,AARP,Alzheimers Association,American Heart Association) in an effort to address topics critical to aging. If one digs a little bit, some corporate (for-profit) companies have philanthropic divisions that support research, programming, and direct services for specific topics or in specific communities. Cultivating connections in your local community or with local experts can help to identify possibilities.Once a potential funder or funding opportunity is identified, there are a few steps to take before preparing a proposal. Thoroughly review the funders website and specific funding opportunities. This process may reinforce that it is a suitable opportunity or it may raise questions (e.g., organizational eligibility, funding levels, timelines). If the funder is offering a call to review the funding opportunity and answer questions, then prepare questions in advance and participate in those calls.One also might seek out an organization that has obtained this funding previously to discuss their process for applying for the grant and working with researchers to gather ideas, as well as any best practices or helpful hints. This is also the time to consider whether your organization is prepared to manage a grant (e.g., Are there finance staff who can assist with grant budgets and reporting?). A grant from a smaller foundation might be a good first step for organizations new to research grants.You know my methods, Watson. Holmes inThe Crooked ManMuch like Holmes and Watson, important learning between partners can benefit a practiceresearch partnership. Partnering with research experts can help legitimize a practice-based organizations work to a potential funder. In addition, the introduction of researchers to a service delivery organization can lead to a range of other extensive benefits including a formalized method for measuring impact. Researchers often learn their trade while in school and by conducting studies in very specific and very controlled circumstances; whereas working with a practice-based organization, researchers learn to adapt to the pragmatic needs in a dynamic service environment.Before beginning a practiceresearch partnership it is important to consider potential partners. Practice-based organizations might seek a researcher partner through a university or a research-specific organization; similarly, a researcher might seek partners through relationships with known practice-based organizations or through targeted outreach to relevant organizations. Next, potential partners should meet to assess how well they can work together. Key areas of consideration include: compatible missions, time and resource expectations, clarity on roles and timelines, communication styles, ownership of ideas and data, and respect (Ovretveit et al., 2014; Zuchowski et al., 2019).There are more and more calls for applied research or real world data or embedded trials, which are all code phrases for research about or directly impacting day-to-day practice and life (Kunkel & Settersten, 2022). For example, a local service provider delivering a service unique to their agency wants to address the research question: is this service effective for a new client population? One way to answer this question is to deliver the service to the new population and track results for the original population and the new population. In this example, the establishment of a practiceresearch partnership has many benefits. In working with the practice organization, researchers can help with the application of theoretical models to guide the research (e.g., are there additional client characteristics the organization had not previously considered?), design methods that are suitable for the program and the staff (e.g., maybe existing administrative data is enough, or maybe short surveys of the clients are needed), and assist with translating the data and research results into an impactful story.The value of a practiceresearch partnership is never-ending. Formalized practiceresearch partnerships have the power to inform decisions, educate, identify needs, enhance understanding of unique and diverse populations, assist in planning, instill the use of best-practice and evidence-based programming, and evaluate impact (Berman et al., 2022). The relationships can provide justification and rationale for initiatives, organizational efforts, funding, and programming. Collaborating with individuals and organizations with expertise and formalized training in research and evaluation will provide a more comprehensive approach and framework for achieving the vision, the mission, and the day-to day work within any entity.Data! Data! Data! ... I can't make bricks without clay. Holmes inThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches.A practiceresearch partnership is fundamental. This partnership allows a comprehensive, thoughtful approach to be developed and followed, data to be collected and analyzed, and proven outcomes measuredall of which are critical elements of a strong case for funding. Pairing research and practice is also applicable to a variety of funding mechanisms and to a diverse array of settings, from community needs assessments, adoption, and adaptation of programs to clinical care, policy development, and analysis. There are a multitude of benefits of a practiceresearch partnershipit provides a clear path for support.

By 2050, that number is expected to grow to 13 million. The lack of advances in interventions providing meaningful therapeutic benefit for AD/ADRD (Anderson et al., 2017; Livingston et al., 2020) have magnified a looming public health crisis. Despite spending an estimated $42 billion over the last quarter century to develop drugs that prevent, treat, and cure the disease, only a handful have been approved by the FDA to treat symptoms of AD/ADRD (Alzheimers Association, 2023; Cummings et al., 2014, 2022). Just as with detection and diagnosis, the use of emerging costly new drugs for Alzheimers disease will be mired in well-known health disparities and perpetuate health inequities (Quinones et al., 2020). Even if those entrenched problems were addressed, we cannot drug our way out of the Alzheimers epidemic (Karlawish, 2023).Development of non-pharmacological interventions for AD/ADRD, which target critically challenging aspects of the disease not amenable to pharmacological approaches (e.g., health services delivery, care partner [CP] support, goal-directed care; Watt et al., 2019) has also faced challenges. Two systematic reviews evaluating the strength of the evidence, one by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center, 2020) and the other by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (Larson & Stroud, 2021), described the pipeline of non-drug dementia care interventions targeting people living with dementia (PLWD) and their CPs as extremely limited, with only two interventions ready for testing in real-world settings.When it comes to improving dementia care, however, experts stress that drug and non-drug interventions should not be used in isolation. Dementia prevention, intervention, and care require holistic multicomponent interventions that address physical and mental health, social care, support, and management of neuropsychiatric symptoms so that PLWD and their CPs can live as well as possible (Livingston et al., 2020). Put simply, we need more research on what kind of dementia care works, how, and for whom, to make a difference in the real world.Timely realization of the benefits of AD/ADRD research is paramount given the magnitude of this public health crisis. However, there are known to be difficulties getting research evidence integrated into everyday clinical practice, a process that reportedly takes 17 years (Morris et al., 2011). This lag time is, undoubtedly, much too long for the millions of Americans suffering with AD/ADRD, their CPs, and the healthcare systems (HCS) that provide dementia care. Scalable and adoptable interventions that are effective in improving the care delivered to this vulnerable population are desperately needed. Meeting this challenge demands innovative approaches and robust infrastructures that bring together HCS, researchers, community partners, funders, and regulators focused on a common purpose to do dementia research differently.Coordinated Efforts for New Approaches and SolutionsDriven by major initiatives (Mitchell et al., 2020; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation [OASPE], 2018) from Congress and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) provide new approaches and solutions to closing the critical gap between research and practice through a multifaceted national strategy of rethinking clinical trials. ePCTs are conducted in real-world environments, such as healthcare systems and clinical settings, with the goal of quickly and efficiently generating high-quality evidence to inform clinical and policy-level decisions (Mitchell et al., 2020; NIH PTC, 2024).In 2012, the NIH Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory (https://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org) was founded to strengthen the nations capacity to conduct ePCTs on major public health issues by engaging healthcare delivery organizations as research partners. Building on this foundational infrastructure and lessons learned from a 2017 National Institute on Aging (NIA) conference titled, State of the Science for Pragmatic Trials of Non-Pharmacological Interventions for Persons with Dementia (OASPE, 2018), the NIA launched a national competition for a dementia-focused pragmatic trials research incubator focused specifically on non-pharmacological interventions to improve dementia care targeting the unique needs of PLWD and their CPs.ePCTs test if and how interventions work when conducted in everyday healthcare settings under real-world conditions.The outcome was a cooperative agreement (U54) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA)ImbeddedPragmaticAlzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (AD/AD/ADRD)ClinicalTrials (IMPACT) Collaboratory (Mitchell et al., 2020). The mission of IMPACT is to build the nations capacity to conduct ePCTs for PLWD and their CPs.Defining ePCTsUnlike traditional clinical trials that test if and how interventions work under ideal conditions in well-controlled environments among relatively homogeneous populations, ePCTs test if and how interventions work when conducted in everyday healthcare settings under real-world conditions. Pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) are designed for the primary purpose of informing decision-makers regarding the comparative balance of benefits, burdens and risks of a biomedical or behavioral health intervention at the individual or population level (Califf & Sugarman, 2015).What makes a PCT an ePCT is that the research is embedded in settings where people already receive their usual clinical care with the aim of accelerating the pace at which healthcare systems adopt evidence into everyday clinical practice. There are many benefits to ePCTs, such as leveraging existing administrative or electronic health records to identify participants and ascertain outcomes, expanding eligibility criteria and recruitment, randomizing at the unit of care or setting level rather than the individual level, and potentially lower costs (Mitchell et al., 2020).Challenges of ePCTs include maintaining the rigor of a clinical trial in busy clinical care settings that may have competing priorities, staff turnover, and unique regulatory considerations (Mitchell et al., 2020). ePCTs are an emerging field that have the potential to transform the landscape of applied research in aging across a variety of topics and close the gap between the traditionally siloed worlds of research and the real-world. Next, we describe how ePCTs are being used to address the national public health priority area of AD/ADRD.ePCTs for Dementia CareBecause studies show that PLWD are at high risk of receiving uncoordinated, low-quality, high-cost care, ultimately leading to poor health outcomes and quality of life, there is an urgent need to generate a high-quality equitable evidence base about what type of dementia care works (Mitchell et al., 2020; OASPE, 2018). This type of applied clinical research holds promise to accelerate the science of dementia care, improve the relevance of interventions to real-world partners, and close the gaps between research, everyday clinical practice, and lived experiences of people with AD/ADRD and their CPs.Despite the promise of this developing field of ePCTs in AD/ADRD, it also has challenges. For example, as a consequence of embedding PCTs in everyday clinical care, scientific studies are conducted in messy real-world environments (Tuzzio et al., 2019). Operational realities and stressors include competing priorities, turnover and retention in personnel, buy-in by busy direct care staff, regulatory oversight, inspections, infection outbreaks, and many other factors. To maintain the rigor of science under real-world conditions, researchers must develop new competencies to create compelling value propositions for HCS (NIA IMPACT Collaboratory, 2021), address priority areas for PLWD and their CPs, maximize intervention implementation in the context of clinical care (Tuzzio et al., 2020), and leverage administrative health data to identify trial participants and track their outcomes (Hanson et al., 2020). IMPACTs resources are put toward building those competencies by funding research, training investigators (NIA IMPACT Collaboratory 2024), building a knowledge-base (NIA IMPACT Collaboratory, n.d.), and engaging partners (Harrison et al., 2020).Integrating Health EquityIt is well known that persons from minoritized groupsincluding those defined by racial, ethnic, sexual, gender, socioeconomic, as well as geographic factorsare vastly underrepresented in traditional randomized clinical trials, despite experiencing higher rates of dementia and worse health outcomes relative to non-Hispanic White populations (Cooper et al., 2010; Matthew et al., 2019; Mayeda et al., 2016). As a result, evidence about the efficacy and effectiveness of dementia interventions, accrued over decades, may not be applicable or relevant to diverse, minoritized populations, making our baseline knowledge skewed and inequitable.As a new approach to applied research, ePCTs aim to disrupt the perpetuation of inequality in the design and conduct of research to improve care for PLWD and their CPs. From the outset, integrating health equity into every aspect in the design and conduct of ePCTs, including representation, relevancy, and partnership with people from marginalized and minoritized groups that are disproportionately impacted by AD/ADRD, has been paramount in the knowledge-building and advancing methodology activities of the IMPACT Collaboratory (Quinones et al., 2020).Including Voices of Lived Experience(s)Because ePCTs have been defined as an essential new approach in the national strategy for AD/ADRD to rapidly and dramatically improve dementia care, it is essential that the research is aligned with what matters most to PLWD, their CPs, direct care staff, and the HCS that care for them (Bennett et al., 2022; Largent et al., 2022). A lack of connection between the interventions selected by researchers for testing and their relevancy to the priorities of PLWD and their CPs may explain, in part, their lack of uptake by HCS in clinical care (Baier et al., 2019).ePCTs aim to disrupt the perpetuation of inequality in the design and conduct of research to improve care for PLWD and their CPs.To avoid this known pitfall, IMPACT took a more activist approach to engaging community partners, reflected in the unique Lived Experience Panel, established in collaboration with the Alzheimers Association. This panel is a diverse group of 14 PLWD and CPs who advise IMPACT on its research direction. The panel intentionally includes voices and perspectives of PLWD and CPs, recognizing that they share a common experience of living with AD/ADRD, but have diverse lived experiences that must be understood to make the science equitable, meaningful, and salient.In addition to traditional scientific peer review of applications to its pilot study funding mechanism, IMPACT also engages PLWD and CPs in a lived experience review panel to evaluate pilot study proposals based on the following three questions: Is this research important? Does this research address an unmet need? Will this make a difference in the real world? Feedback from these diverse partners is integrated into funding decisions.Advancing Applied Research in AgingThe recognition that conducting ePCTs with PLWD and their CPs merited a focused and coordinated initiative, combined with momentum and foundational work laid by the NIH Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory and others, have created conditions to advance the field and for the IMPACT Collaboratory to emerge and flourish. Advancing ePCTs as a new approach and solution to transform the real-world delivery and outcomes of care provided to Americans living with dementia cannot be realized without devoting attention and training resources to designing and conducting trials in real-world environments, holistically integrating health equity, and including diverse perspectives from community partners early and often. The IMPACT Collaboratory is a national infrastructure and resource that is making deliberate strides toward these audacious, and much needed, goals to improve dementia care in real-world environments for millions of Americans and their care partners.This work was supported by the National Institute of Aging (NIA) of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number U54AG063546, which funds NIA Imbedded Pragmatic Alzheimers Disease and AD-Related Dementias Clinical Trials Collaboratory (NIA IMPACT Collaboratory).Sponsors Role:The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.Jill Harrison, PhD, is an executive director of the NIA IMPACT Collaboratory and associate professor of the Practice at Brown University, School of Public Health in Providence, RI.

Tamara Konetzka, and Marshall H. ChinJune 26, 2024TagsInnovation & Social ImpactHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureAbstract:To achieve optimal, equitable health outcomes for all older adults, the United States desperately needs equity in access to, quality of, and cost of aging care. To illustrate these needs, we discuss the current inequitable state of frailty care. Frailty disproportionately affects marginalized populations, yet these populations struggle to access high-quality geriatrics care and long-term care services and supports (LTSS) that mitigate frailty, leading to accelerated frailty trajectories. Health services research can provide the data needed to document, elucidate, and address health inequities in frailty care, including early identification and referral of frail adults to specialized care and financing LTSS.Key Words:frailty, equity, inequity, health services research, older adults, geriatrics, long-term care services and supportsInequities in access to primary care, specialized geriatric care pathways, exercise and nutrition programming, and long-term services and supports (LTSS) lead to inequities in the trajectories of aging health. In this article, we illustrate how health services research may help us understand and address those inequities, focusing on frailty, a later stage of physiological vulnerability along the spectrum of aging biology. We chose frailty because it represents a prevalent condition that requires equitable medical, social, and public health services to optimize. We also chose frailty because it emphasizes that achieving equity in aging trajectories requires support services to be initiated at the time of physiologic deterioration and not after a poor outcome has occurred.Frail older adults are particularly vulnerable to adverse health-related events such as falls, frequent hospitalization, disability, delirium, surgical morbidity and mortality, and institutionalization. Frailty is a medical syndrome that reflects a state of impaired physiology: the body is susceptible to disturbed physiologic homeostasis in the face of a stressor and requires more time to recover, if recovery occurs at all. This state of vulnerability is prevalent in approximately 10% to 15% of community-dwelling U.S. adults older than age 65. Frailty disproportionately affects populations that are marginalized due to one or more social identities (socioeconomic and racial/ethnic identities as well as age and gender; Babulal et al., 2019; Usher et al., 2021), or the socioeconomics of ones country.Optimal identification of frailty to prevent, mitigate, or slow functional decline and poor health outcomes depends upon reliable and consistent access to primary care and routine frailty screening. Optimal frailty management requires early referral to specialized geriatric care pathways; strength, activity, and nutrition support; and LTSS, the broad range of services designed to assist individuals who have difficulty performing activities of daily living.Accordingly, frailty provides an excellent context for discussing aging health equity, which means providing everyone a fair and just opportunity to be healthy. But achieving equity in healthcare access, quality, and cost for frail older adults remains elusive. Improving equity in healthcare for frail older adults requires identifying and quantifying the barriers to equity, developing and testing interventions designed to address the barriers, implementing and scaling the interventions, and sustaining interventions over time via data and science. Health services research collects and analyzes data to inform clinical, public health, and policy interventions to improve health and healthcare. This article discusses the role of health services research in understanding and addressing aging health equity around frailty.Health Services ResearchHealth services research studies healthcare access, quality, and cost. Health services research encompasses the organization, delivery, and financing of health and social services (see Figure 1, below). These factors are studied across individuals, families, caregivers, subpopulations and communities, providers, organizations, and societal systems. Structural racism, ageism, and other systems of oppressions impact these individuals, communities, and entities. Health services research utilizes tools, qualitative and quantitative methods, and models from different disciplines to improve the ability of the healthcare system to respond to a patients needs, values, and interests in real-world settings (Wensing & Ullrich, 2023).Figure 1 LegendHealth services research framework for measuring and addressing equity in frailty care.Frailty is a medical syndrome that reflects a state of impaired physiology. Frailty disproportionately affects marginalized populations, and older adult subgroups have differential access to frailty management programming. Together these disparities lead to inequities in frailty identification, care, and ultimately trajectories of aging health. Health services research studies healthcare access, quality, and cost, and can guide improving equity in pre-frail and frail older adult care. Health services research can help identify and address systems of oppression in healthcare access, quality, and cost across multiple levels of analysis (e.g., individual, organization, neighborhood, policy) and across stages of care (e.g., identification of pre-frail or frailty, referral to specialized care pathways, utilization of services, and trajectories of health and aging outcomes).While health services research is not exclusively applied to health disparities topics, the soul of health services research is health equity for all patients. Below we present a typical case of a frail older person, summarize key aspects of good care for frail older adults, and propose health services research responses to identified challenges to equity in the care of frail adults.A typical scenario of frailty management in our healthcare system:Ms. Huston was a 75-year-old retired social worker with traditional Medicare insurance, living at an income level just above Medicaid qualification. She was referred to geriatrics after a long hospital admission for delirium, sepsis, and new carcinoma in situ. The facility did not coordinate transportation for her first visit to geriatrics, so she missed her appointment. She did not have a regular primary care physician prior to her hospitalization and was therefore never assessed for frailty, cognitive changes, disability, falls, or other geriatric syndromes that would have triggered early geriatrics care referrals. She had lived alone in an apartment on the second floor of her building without an elevator. She no longer liked to drive so she relied on a few neighbors in her building to take her to places like the grocery store. She never married and had no children. Her siblings lived in other states and had health issues of their own. Her glasses were outdated and broken due to difficulty getting to the eye doctor.With low staffing in this resource-strapped nursing home, the family struggled to ensure that Ms. Hustons basic needs were met.Following her hospitalization, Ms. Huston completed subacute rehabilitation in a low-quality nursing home. Her function did not improve enough for her to return to her independent apartment living; her rehabilitation was stopped early in part because she could not afford the copay after the first 20 days of subacute rehabilitation. Due to being a fall risk, she was not allowed to have a walker in her room, so she mostly lay in bed or sat in a wheelchair. She could not afford a high-end assisted living facility, which would have provided needed support for her instrumental activities of daily living. Hiring a private homemaker, or homecare aide, was not possible due to shortages of homecare workers and the high cost. A higher quality transitional care building was out of reach to her at more than $100,000 per year.Ms. Huston could not afford a mobile phone, and her friends could not visit the facility regularly. She became socially isolated and very lonely. Her siblings would send care packages with high protein snacks, crafts, socks, and shoes. Her physician prescribed daily strength exercises for recovery of independence, but she needed someone to help her with these and low staffing at the facility prevented 1:1 support. A return to her apartment became increasingly unrealistic; she quickly depleted her savings and became reliant upon Medicaid. With low staffing in this resource-strapped nursing home, the family struggled to ensure that Ms. Hustons basic needs were met, let alone that she could thrive there.Frailty Assessment and Management OverviewFrailty assessment can differentiate physiologic risk in older adults, helping to identify and guide tailored care of vulnerable adults. National leaders have called for broad implementation across health systems. Preferably, objective assessments of physiologic function identify frailty. Gait, endurance, exhaustion, strength, balance, and activity are important components of frailty measurement tools but require an in-person evaluation. Early identification of people with frailty could help direct the most vulnerable adults to needed specialized geriatric care pathways.But no standard, systematic mechanism exists in the United States for identifying frail or pre-frail adults. Referral of older adults to geriatricians, social workers, pharmacists, physical or occupational therapists, audiologists, speech therapists, and other specialists depends upon local availability of overworked primary care physicians and geriatric care specialists. These challenges lead to disparate and inconsistent frailty care access and quality, especially for socioeconomically and geographically marginalized communities, and for homebound older adults, those facing health or technology literacy issues, and those with limited English proficiency (Press et al., 2021).Frailty mitigation trials have tested exercise, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, and comprehensive education and support programs. To date, strength exercise with or without protein supplementation and interdisciplinary multidimensional team programs show the most evidence for slowing decline. However, LTSS, including assistance with basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, are required for most frailty mitigation interventions to be successful. LTSS may be provided in the home, in the community, or at a facility. These services treat or compensate for cognitive and/or physical disability and are critical to properly implementing frailty management over time.Despite their necessity to older adult health, most LTSS are not covered by health insurance for most older adults. Medicare, the primary healthcare payor among adults ages 65 and older in the United States, only covers short-term skilled home health services and short-term subacute rehabilitation. Most LTSS are funded by Medicaid in the home of facilities, targeting low-income older adults. The federal Older Americans Act funding covers activities that help older adults continue to live in the community independently, such as transportation, nutrition, caregiver support, recreation, and some in-home assistance.Paying for LTC privately is arguably the biggest health-related financial risk facing frail older adults today.Older adults who are ineligible for Medicaid pay for LTSS out-of-pocket or it is donated by family. Out-of-pocket long-term care (LTC) costs are prohibitive for most older adults except the very wealthy, even for the 13% of U.S. older adults who have purchased limited LTC insurance (Bernard et al., 2009). Some subgroups disproportionately provide unpaid, informal caregiving to older adults, which can then contribute to disparities in the positive and negative consequences of being a caregiver (Cohen et al., 2019).The roadmap to advance health equity in frail older adult care using health services research:Health equity for all frail older persons requires an approach that intentionally advances health equity as opposed to general one-size-fits-all solutions. Health services research that applies an equity lens to quality and systems improvement can informed tailored interventions. For example, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Roadmap to Advance Health Equity (Chin et al., 2012) outlines an iterative process in which healthcare delivery organizations can identify inequities in the care and outcomes of frail persons by stratifying clinical and systems performance data by social risk category (e.g. race/ethnicity, immigration status, English proficiency, disability status, cognitive function, gait speed).Then the organizations perform a root cause analysis of noted disparities in partnership with patients and communities; design interventions and care systems to address those root causes; and implement, monitor, and repeat analysis of noted disparities. An equity lens requires active searching for ways that interpersonal and structural racism, ageism, and other systems of oppression are built into the U.S. healthcare system [Bailey et al., 2017]. Qualitative interviews and/or focus groups of patients and community members are crucial for identifying those barriers, which could include implicit biases and lack of respect and trustworthiness, structural barriers to accessing care, and problems with the system of care such as inadequate interpreter services.Health services research can help illuminate the role of access to and quality of equitable care of frail older persons. Neighborhood and geospatial analysis may help identify variation in the supply of healthcare and long-term care facilities, and social services (Tung et al., 2017). All too often populations experiencing health inequities have fewer resources around them. A health equity approach to the care of frail older persons requires a targeted universalism approach incorporating principles of distributive justice. In other words, the health equity goal should be to improve access to care, quality of care, and outcomes of all frail older persons, while providing more resources and support to those with greater medical and social needs.Health services research also can inform payment interventions to support and incentivize the types of care transformations that can meet the needs of diverse frail older persons and improve health equity (Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network & Health Equity Advisory Team, 2021). Health services research has been essential for evaluating payment interventions to improve health equity, such as rewarding care and outcomes of marginalized persons and reducing disparities; flexible funding that can be used for social services, community health workers, and care coordination for all older adults; and risk adjusting payment for the social risk of populations to encourage acute and subacute care of marginalized patients and communities.Below, we highlight the potential utility of health services research in addressing frail older adult care health inequities by proposing health services research responses. We include potential health services projects to measure inequity and inform and test interventions that address inequity in frail older adult care. We specifically cover advancing equity in healthcare and in LTSS, which are essential for optimal frail older adult outcomes.Advancing Equity in Healthcare for Frail Older AdultsHealth services research can help advance equitable access to healthcare, including access to frailty identification and management services (e.g., frailty screening and timely referral of frail adults to specialized geriatrics care pathways). Access involves availability of affordable, accessible, and acceptable frailty screening tools that accommodate the needs and preferences of older adults with diverse identities and backgrounds. Health services research could advance equity in frailty screening by: 1) developing novel, culturally tailored frailty screening tools; 2) validating the tools against in-person physical frailty diagnostic assessments; 3) generating test characteristics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) across subgroups (e.g., race/ethnicity, language, geographic location, age, gender, literacy levels), responder types (e.g., patient versus caregiver), and delivery vehicles (paper versus digital delivery); and 4) testing the feasibility, usability, accessibility, and adoptability of an implemented screening tool among tool administrators and patients.When frailty screening tools are implemented, health services research could 5) examine and address the consistency of data collection and potential biases; 6) compare referral for specialized care services between standard of care versus a triggered referral using the screening tool; and 7) investigate the use of specialized care services, barriers to use, and effectiveness of specific services on patient outcomes. Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening and referral processes, compared to standard care, could inform policy change.Advancing Equity in LTSS for Frail Older AdultsLTSS are not affordable for most families in the United States. Contrary to what many believe, Medicare does not cover LTSS. As a payer of last resort, Medicaid has become the largest payer of LTSS, covering nursing home and some degree of home- and community-based services for impoverished individuals. Private LTC insurance policies are expensive and have never gained widespread popularity. This leaves a large swath of the income spectrum, those who are not rich but have some income or assets, with the burden of paying for LTC privately (Pearson et al., 2019), arguably the biggest health-related financial risk facing frail older adults today.The United States is the only high-income country that lacks universal healthcare coverage.Health services research has documented large state-to-state variations in access to LTSS (Muramatsu et al., 2010). Medicaid eligibility differs across states, as do LTSS delivery and financing systems. Numerous health services research projects have shown that the lack of a systematic payment system for LTSSinterwoven with a long history of systemic, structural racismexacerbates well-documented inequities in access to and quality of LTSS among marginalized racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic subgroups (Konetzka & Werner, 2009; Sloan et al., 2021). Systemic racism in LTC includes structural factors (e.g., location of low-quality, low-resourced providers in low-income neighborhoods and location of high-end assisted living facilities in affluent neighborhoods); cultural factors (e.g., perception that some minoritized groups are undeserving of services or that their families should care for them); and interpersonal factors (e.g., racial biases against LTC workers and recipients). The result is that non-White, low- or middle-income older adults with LTC needs are more likely to have unmet needs, depend solely upon family caregivers, use nursing home care rather than assisted living, and be admitted to the lowest-quality nursing homes (Gorges et al., 2019; Konetzka & Werner, 2009; Lee et al., 2021; Shippee et al., 2022).Policymakers and researchers have suggested major financing reforms to improve access to LTSS and decrease inequities. These include expanding Medicare to include a LTC benefit covering institutional care and home- and community-based services for all beneficiaries in need, potentially replacing the outsized role of state Medicaid programs, thereby increasing equity across states and by race, ethnicity, and income (Werner & Konetzka, 2022). Less bold reforms already underway include Medicaid expansions of home-based services, programs to reduce expensive institutionalization, and alternative payment models (e.g., Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly [PACE] and Fully Integrated Special Needs Plans [FIDE-SNPs]) designed to encourage efficient and effective care. Many alternative payment models focus on people enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid and target greater coordination across the two programs.Health services research has been integral to studying these evolving policies, leveraging large data sets (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid claims) and analytical tools to evaluate the effects of policy reforms on access, quality, and equity. These approaches take advantage of vast statistical power and representation by subgroups available in these large data sets to study equity from a population perspective. If and when bolder, systemic solutions seem politically feasible, health services research will be necessary to simulate potential effects and design policies effectively.It was almost a half century ago in 1980 when Bruce Vladeck publishedUnloving Care: The Nursing Home Tragedy. Since then, the delivery, financing, and organization of aging care have undergone many changes, including federal and state efforts to shift the balance of LTSS to home- and community-based services, and away from nursing homes. Yet care for frail older adults remains fragmented, inequitable, inefficient, ineffective, and unsustainable. There is an urgent need for a long-term vision of how such care should be equitably delivered, financed, and coordinated. The United States is the only high-income country that lacks universal healthcare coverage.Other high-income countries operate tax- or social insurancebased systems to finance healthcare and LTSS. Some countries, such as Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, have introduced a nationwide LTC insurance system where people pay premiums regularly to destigmatize equitable care for older adults (Tsutsui & Muramatsu, 2007). Learning from lived experiences of policymakers, providers, and consumers of other countries is critical for developing an equitable, effective, and efficient LTSS system for increasingly diverse aging populations in the United States.ConclusionAdvancing equity in access to, quality of, and cost of frail older adult care challenges all of us professionally and personally. Everyone is at risk for frailty and will need well-coordinated healthcare and LTSS that are culturally appropriate and accessible. The ongoing crisis in frailty care remains invisible to the public in the United States. Health services researchers should collaborate with the Aging Network (the national network of federal, state, and local agencies established by the Older Americans Act of 1965) and the healthcare sector to understand the U.S. frailty care system, inform the public and policymakers of the frailty-care crisis, and develop and test interventions that bring our system closer to the vision of equitable frailty care for all Americans.AcknowledgmentsFunding/Support:Dr. Huisingh-Scheetz receives funding from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (P50MD017349-01, 8199 and P50MD017349-03S1), the Prostate Cancer FoundationBayer, the National Institute on Aging (R01AG043538, 2R01 AG048511-09), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (R01 DK127961-01), and the National Institutes of Health (1R61AG086824-01).Dr. Muramatsu was supported in part by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health, under Award Number P30AG083255 and R01AG035675.Dr. Konetzka was supported in part by the National Institute on Aging under Award Number 1RF1AG069857-01.Dr. Chin was supported in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Advancing Health Equity: Leading Care, Payment, and Systems Transformation National Program Office and the Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research (NIDDK P30 DK092949).The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health or other organizations associated with the authors.Conflict of Interest Disclosures:Dr. Huisingh-Scheetz co-developed a custom exercise and social engagement application deployed via a voice-activated device and website.

Each of these goals involves multiple sectors and stakeholders, and likely multiple policy levers.How can we tell if we are moving the needle toward these goals? How can we capture the value of our alignment and interventions? How can we do due diligence when seeking to optimize the impact of our on-the-ground work?The main ways we can do these things are via data and applied research practices. Applied research focuses on helping us understand how to prevent and solve practical problems that affect real people (as opposed to theoretical or basic research, which contributes to general knowledge). Applied research practices help find and correct problems and inefficiencies by studyinghowa system is working and help us understand and articulate impact by evaluating theeffectsa program has had.To answer the above questions, applied research leverages quantitative and qualitative data from various systems and actions relevant to the program. For example, applied research in healthcare is often referred to as health services research, a field that studies how social factors, financing systems, organizational structures and processes, health technologies, and personal behaviors affect access to health care, the quality and cost of health care, and ultimately, our health and well-being (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2014). This quote recognizes the stakeholders and systems that need to be engaged and leveraged in applied research.Advancing applied research in aging will ultimately improve older adult health and well-being. Yet, it is hard to carve out time to consider opportunities to engage in applied research in new ways. This issue ofGenerations Journalwas designed to explore a range of issues related to applied research in aging, based on our joint interests as co-editors.Urgent Need for DataFor me, Claire, a palliative medicine physician and health services researcher, what brings me to the issue of health services research is the urgency with which we need better data to advocate for the needs of older adults with serious illness, given our shifting healthcare systems.In the past decades we have seen a major transformation of healthcare, particularly that which is delivered through the Medicare program, from fee-for-service to value-based care payment structures. The majority of Medicare is now delivered through private insurance companies, via Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are paid capitated amounts to deliver care.Given the MA plans strong profit motive, there is incentive and opportunity for such plans to limitthe delivery of important care.MA plans are particularly appealing for their lower cost-sharing for some services and expanding benefits, and enrollment in them has grown the fastest in Black and Hispanic communities. MA plans promise innovation and flexibility, including expanded abilities to deliver services not covered by traditional insurance but critical to meeting the needs of older adults, such as transportation, meals, and caregiver supports. These plans offer incredible opportunity to meet the needs of older adults.Yet, given the strong profit motive baked into the MA plan, there is both incentive and opportunity for MA plans to limit the delivery of important care. For example, we have long known that people are more likely to leave the MA program when they become sicker, likely because of challenges with limited provider networks, service denials, and prior authorization requirements. While supplemental benefits are promising, there is minimal transparency in who receives these benefits, and other advantages of MA, such as closer integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits for some who are dually eligible, have yet to be proven in evaluations.This growth of the MA program, coupled with tremendous promise and great opacity, calls for applied research into how new benefits and programs through MA could address social needs and if they are reducing or widening disparities in care for the populations they insure.Outcomes Evaluations Discern Impact in Social CareAnd for me, Bonnie, a health policy professional working in a health systems social work and community health department, much of my work is focused on implementing, refining, and sustaining efforts to address health-related social needs and mental health concerns. As practitioners, it is incumbent upon us to use whatever information we can to ensure we are having our intended impact, finding ways to optimize, and advocating for what we need to do it better and more sustainably.In practice, this is hard to do. We often cannot measure or access data on the outcomes we most want to study. Documentation and data systems are complex and not nimble, making it a slow process to refine templates and build reports. It can feel daunting to focus more on documentation, data, and research when you are just keeping up with your caseload or workload. However, by seeking out and leveraging data from diverse internal and external sources, program leaders can identify priority populations, project program reach and impact, monitor progress toward goals, address participant and staff feedback, and design outcomes evaluations to discern impact. For instance, at Rush, outcomes evaluations have helped us to understand areas of impact on patients, families, and healthcare providers, and to advocate for additional funding from our institution, philanthropic funders, and from Medicare itself.While our evaluations and anecdotal feedback consistently show improved patient and family outcomes after our social work and community health worker interventions, it is challenging to identify what it is about their presence and their interventions that contributes to those outcomes. For more than 10 years, leaders in social care have identified a need to understand which specific service components yield desired outcomes for specific patient populations, to address social needs at scale (Shier et al., 2013).It is hard to pinpoint causal impact when there are multiple levers involved.Applied research on social care has advanced in the past decade; however, questions remain about how social care intervention componentse.g., resource navigation, care coordination, and emotional supportcontribute to improvements in health and in care utilization (Gottlieb et al., 2024). For instance, Rushs social work after-hospital transitional care intervention trial demonstrated statistically significant increases in primary care appointment attendance compared with the control group. Was that primarily because the social worker reminded the patient and coordinated transportation logistics for the appointment? What role did other aspects of the intervention, such as connection with home-delivered meals, identifying in-home caregiver support options, and building a trusting relationship with the patient and family play in enabling them to recover from the hospitalization and ultimately attend that appointment?What role did other community influences have, such as an advertisement the patient saw for a medication they had a question about, or their neighbor who is always checking in on them? It is hard to pinpoint causal impact when there are multiple levers involved, but applied research practices and innovations provide guideposts for ways we can try.Advancing Applied Research in AgingSo, what motivates our shared interests in bringing this issue of Generations Journal forward? We both see a challenge and opportunity in research that addresses social needs, traditionally viewed as not in the purview of the healthcare system but necessary to meet the needs of older adults. This is as important for novel programs within an academic health system as it is for evaluations of supplemental benefits delivered through MA plans.The article byTeresa Moro, Jeannine M. Rowe, and Victoria M. Rizzoappropriately highlights how interprofessional research collaborations can best advance research on social care. Inherent to addressing the social needs of older adults is a deep consideration of how our current systems and proposed programs influence inequities in healthcare delivery. Addressing inequities through health services research is addressed with nuance byMegan Huisingh-Scheetz et al., andAmy Eisensteinspeaks to how equity issues may be incorporated in programmatic evaluation.We also have selected articles highlighting research that has been effectively translated to directly inform care delivery and policies. The authors in this issue of Generations Journal illustrate that impact can occur at many levels: from pragmatic trials and research-practice partnerships where clinical innovations are designed to be most effective in real-world settings, to community-based aging research, to the use of data at the state level to advance caregiver support. We hope these pieces serve as inspiration for where and how applied research can be most effective, and provide valuable lessons in research funding, design, and dissemination.The articles in this issue highlight the exciting growth in aging health services research that addresses social needs, health inequities, and that directly translates to programs and policies that improve patient care. We are grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such an outstanding group of authors and hope you enjoy learning from all of them.Claire Ankuda, MD, is an associate professor in Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and lives in Vermont.

That is exactly what happened when we asked Bonnie Ewald and Claire Ankuda to guest edit this complex issue, Advancing Applied Research in Aging, of Generations.Turns out that adage is repeated for good reason. These two incredibly busy people with taxing day jobs and full lives off the clock pulled together a substantial, meaningful issue quickly.Bonnie Ewald is managing director of the Center for Health and Social Care Integration (CHaSCI), a training and policy center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, with academic appointments in Rushs Departments of Social Work and its Health Systems Management department, and leadership roles developing health equity initiatives.She volunteers for ASA, convening the bi-monthly virtual Chicagoland ASA Roundtable, among other activities. She also won the 2023 Emerging Leader Award from the Health & Medicine Policy Research Group and helped to get the bipartisanIntegrating Social Workers Across Healthcare Settings Actintroduced in summer 2023.Claire Ankuda, MD, is an associate professor in Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has a baby and is building a house in rural Vermont after having recently relocated from New York City. Her current work is funded by a Paul B. Beeson Emerging Leaders Career Development Award from the National Institute on Aging and she was in 2023 awarded the Terrie Fox Wetle Rising Star Award in Health Services and Aging Research.Its so important that we keep that broad scope to understand the barriers to real-world implementation, and what the unintended consequences are of anything we do.These guest editors determination to get this valuable information into the hands of our members won the day. Ewald focuses on supporting teams in implementing, refining, and sustaining care that addresses health-related social needs and mental health concerns, for which she needs to use information to best steward limited time and resources. And in her work managing the Coalition for Social Work and Health, Ewald aims to amplify the value and expertise social workers bring as team members in healthcare.Social workers do so many things to get people what they want and needoften skillfully weaving many activities and clinical skills together into one interventionso it can be particularly insightful and impactful to research social work services, she said.But it has always been hard to get federal research funding on social work services and most practice-based demonstrations rolled out by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation have not studied who is really implementing the models and how team members collaborate to make it happen.I look forward to more applied research on models that leverage interprofessional team members and cross-sector partnerships to attend to what matters most for peoples health and well-being as we age and navigate caregiving rolesto help us better understand how collaboration is happening and the unique contributions of team members across the care continuum, she added.As a palliative care physician and health services researcher, Ankuda said her clinical work has shown me that the end of life can be a time of meaning, of deep connection in families and friendships, and can honor and celebrate the lives that people have lived.But, it can also be a time of fragmentation and abandonment by our healthcare and social support systems, where patients and families are left to muddle through incredibly difficult situations without the appropriate supports. This is apparent with insurance coverage, home-based supports, medication access, and nurse and aide staffing, which can determine what the dying experience might really entail.Applied research is an important way to show us what policies and programs can improve care, and which are threatening highest-quality care at the end of life, Ankuda said. Her work focuses on Medicare Advantage plans, which hold promise in innovation and delivering social services, and also substantial risks of reduced care quality for elders with serious illness, due to aggressive cost-control mechanisms.Shes excited by the varied nature of this issues approaches to applied researchfrom pragmatic trials in a clinical setting to community- and state-based research.I also think we bring forward some excellent pieces to outline how to think about funding and evaluation that are really important for those less experienced in applied research, Ankuda said.For people newer to data and evaluation we hope this issue will help demystify some of the language and processes to get started.As applied research frames research in the real-world, it allows for a wide range of intervention impacts. Its so important that we keep that broad scope to understand the barriers to real-world implementation, and what the unintended consequences are of anything we do, said Ankuda. These lenses are key to effective research that reduces the dramatic disparities we see in the care older adults receive.Ewald hopes this issue will inspire readers to incorporate applied research in their own work in some waywhether at the patient/family level, at the program/organization level, and at the community level. For people newer to data and evaluation we hope this issue will help demystify some of the language and processes to get started.As part of CHaSCIs work at Rush, applied research has been integral to developing and refining our models of care, and we have consistently seen how important it is to have outcomes research to increase recognition of our services value and to influence policy change. There are so many opportunities for better alignment of systems at the community level too, with applied research helping guide these changes, said Ewald.Ankuda spoke of some other real-life impacts of the research they both do. Living in rural America, I am reminded again and again how much place impacts care and aging. Communities here are much stronger than many in the cities Ive lived in, but we also lack a lot of the aging resources that are focused in urban places. The challenge of better understanding rural disparities in aging and how policies can reduce them is a very compelling current focus of mine, and Im particularly interested in applied research that can address some of these regional aging disparities.I envision a world where there is parity in how we care for physical health, mental health, and social health throughout peoples livesand applied research can help is get there by improving our care models and by building buy-in among stakeholders to invest in this redesigned care system, said Ewald.Alison Biggar is ASA's editorial director.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Annette ShaffYou may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2024Data Could Now Guide Population-Based Improvements in Local EldercareBy Nils Franco and Joanne LynnJune 26, 2024TagsHealth & Well-beingInnovation & Social ImpactAbstract:Medicare and Medicaid data, augmented with additional datasets, can now help communities improve eldercare by revealing local priorities and monitoring improvements. With initial partner communities, we developed and monitored dozens of performance measures, such as inappropriate medication use, the prevalence of severe pressure ulcers, and fall rates, all at a local level. Nursing home and home care assessments, together with Medicare claims, enabled measurement for cohorts with functional or cognitive disability or persons in their last year of life. These data could support efficient eldercare improvement activities in all U.S. communities.Key Words:data, population-based, eldercare, performance measures, disability, fall rates, pressure ulcers, Medicare, MedicaidMost older Americans will live for many months with serious disabilities that medical and supportive care can modify but can neither prevent nor cure. Living with disabilities ties us to our geographic community. But does the community have enough affordable and disability-adapted housing? Can you get prepared food delivered? Do employers support family caregivers and is there an adequate supply of skilled caregivers for hire? Do the medical care system and long-term care facilities serve us well?Shortcomings in these types of service and support arrangements cannot be remedied for one person or by one provider or care coordinator. Instead, remedies require concerted actions on behalf of the affected local population. This population approach, or public health perspective, tied to the locality has rarely been implemented in U.S. eldercare (that is, long-term services and supports for older adults living with disabilities).The two of us have worked with a dozen projects anchored by local leaders who aimed to improve eldercare for geographic communities. Each community made some gains, but each encountered substantial frustrations with the lack of useful public data and tried to make do with ad hoc indicators of uncertain merit. That situation is no longer necessary. Every geopolitical area in the United States could have useful data concerning its performance regarding eldercare, if only some entity had the will and the financing to develop and sustain the analyses. The anchoring data would be Medicare and Medicaid claims and assessment data, linked to census and other existing survey data. Targeted local data collection could supplement those readily available data, when needed to monitor the performance of eldercare arrangements at baseline and with efforts at improvement.The Medicare and Medicaid DataThe administration of Medicare and Medicaid generates data concerning beneficiaries medical diagnoses, procedures, and services, including assessments of functional and cognitive performance for individuals in a nursing facility (theNursing Home Minimum Data Set, or MDS) or in a home health episode (theOutcomes Assessment Information Set, or OASIS).In the past, these data generated aggregate tables and graphs published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and little more. Explicitly with the aim of improving healthcare payment and policy, CMS established the Virtual Research Data Center (VRDC) and now licenses analysts to work on the complete Medicare and Medicaid data sets. Their work must pass privacy review, and access costs licensee organizations at least $35,000 annually (CMS, 2023). This access opens remarkable new opportunities, including insights into the experiences of a geographically defined population of Medicare beneficiaries (including persons also enrolled in Medicaid).The most complete and timely data describe the Medicare beneficiary population and include all claims incurred under the original fee-for-service Medicare system. Complete but less timely files contain nurses assessments from Medicare home health episodes and all-payer nursing facility stays, as well as Part D prescription drugs.While quality and completeness issues now limit the utility of Medicare Advantage and Medicaid data, CMS recently has sought to improve data from both programs. Analysts can merge these data at the small-area level with aggregate data points from census surveys and with information supplied locally. Data providers also can link these data to neighborhood deprivation indices and other existing surveys. OASIS and MDS assessments can establish a cohort of older adults living with dependencies in activities of daily living or with cognitive failure. Claims data can contribute to cohort identification as well, for example with diagnoses of cognitive impairments or with claims-based frailty indices (Heins et al., 2023). Data drawing upon an array of sources can help to profile quality and access issues in each community.Its time to make the resulting data available to communities that develop strategies to improve eldercare in their geographic populations.The time has come to consider making the resulting data available to communities that develop strategies to improve eldercare for their geographic populations. Using these data, a community could see that its older adults face too much use of contraindicated drugs, or excessive pressure ulcers, or too little use of hospice servicesand a host of other elements that Medicare and Medicaid document. They could test hunches that certain sub-populations experience much better or worse care than the overall eldercare population. Leaders can see what is happening, for example, to persons living with serious disabilities, persons coming to the end of life, or persons with specific demographic characteristics or living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Communities can readily compare their metrics to other communities, including to peer communities with similar demographics (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) & University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute (UWPHI), 2017).Analysts can aggregate these data to provide insights that guide community leaders and affected organizations. Our experience confirms the usefulness of these data to identify and then address problems in care delivery, social needs, and policy. Better data on eldercare could generate commitments to invest in underfunded nonmedical services and workforce development and to enhance the performance of the medical care arrangements for all local older adults living with disabilities.Synopsis of Our MethodsIn 202021, we had the opportunity to work with two organizations with access to CMSs Virtual Research Data Center (CareJourney and the Institute for Accountable Care at Brandeis University). We had recruited a dozen communities where some entity was trying to improve some aspects of eldercare, and all partnering entities were hamstrung by the lack of data to guide and evaluate improvement work.We developed geographic delineations of each community and calculated some well-known metrics among traditional Medicare beneficiaries for that population, such as rehospitalization rates, hospitalization rates, potentially avoidable use of the emergency room, and use of hospice. Additionally, we constructed these metrics by provider, to identify providers whose patients faced the greatest risks of adverse events or had the greatest rates of receiving eldercare. We incorporated census data, provider resources, and area deprivation indices. In each county, using OASIS, MDS, and claims data, we estimated the cohort that probably had serious cognitive failure or dependency in two or more activities of daily living (2+ ADL), or both. We could also describe the cohort that was in the last 12 months of life.Using a published algorithm, we could see the rate of falls among persons ages 65 and older, by county and by quarter. A summary and national map of the resulting falls data are available publicly (Hoffman et al., 2022). We analyzed Part D prescription medications for the use of drugs commonly inappropriate for use in older adults (The 2023 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2023).Any analysis that could be done for any one community could be done for all communitiesand indeed comparisons to the national distribution or to peer counties required this breadth of data. With the cohort analyses, we ended up with more than 400 data points for every countys Traditional Medicare population. And for any interested entity, the analysts could home in on the providers in that county.Examples Using These DataCounty performance and adverse events can be measured using a variety of data, for example, by examining benzodiazepine and severe pressure ulcers in cohorts with varying disabilities, dual Medicare-Medicaid enrollment, and proximity to end of life. Another example is to plot the adverse event of falls over time with comparisons to the experience of other counties.1. Benzodiazepine use among people with self-care disability. This density plot shows the distribution of all U.S. counties share of older adults with self-care disability who filled one or more benzodiazepine prescription during 2018. The national average is shown in a vertical blue line, and Miami-Dades rates are shown in red, indicating strong opportunity for improvement in that countys benzodiazepine rates. Three subcohorts are shown. For Miami-Dade, subcohort comparisons demonstrate that the issue is worst among dual Medicaid enrollees and is not primarily driven by patterns of care in the last year of life.Figure 1. U.S. County Distribution of Benzodiazepine Prescribing Prevalence Among Four Cohorts of Older Adults with Self-Care Disability in 2018: Miami-Dade in FocusAdapted from authors work, published online (Franco, 2021). The analyzed population is traditional Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 or older continuously enrolled in Parts A & B in 2018.2. Severe pressure ulcers among people with self-care disability.Here, a density plot shows the distribution of counties shares of older adults with self-care disability who experienced severe pressure ulcers (stage 3, 4, or unstageable) during the year. Miami-Dade has more than twice the measured rate of ulcers as the national average. Subcohort comparisons suggest the Medicare-only (not dual Medicaid enrolled) population may be a strong focus for improvement efforts. Remarkably, one in four older adults who died in Miami in 2018 suffered with severe pressure ulcers that year.Figure 2. U.S. County Distribution of Severe Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Among Four Cohorts of Older Adults with Self-Care Disability in 2018: Miami-Dade in FocusAdapted from authors work, published online (Franco, 2021). The analyzed population is traditional Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 or older continuously enrolled in Parts A & B in 2018.3. County-level fall-related injuries among older adults.This visual provides falls rates over time, allowing monitoring of fall risk in the county and comparing with the average and low rates across U.S. counties. The general trend toward higher fall rates and the seasonal pattern are apparent, as well as the observation that this county is doing better than the national average on this measure, but not as well as 10% of counties.Source: Traditional Medicare claims and beneficiary data analyzed by the Institute for Accountable Care, using methods described in authors published work (Hoffman et al., 2022). The analyzed population is Traditional Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 or older continuously enrolled in Parts A & B.Our partnering community entities usually wanted to understand how their metrics compared to the national distribution, or to peer counties (RWJF & UWPHI, 2017), and to scan for metrics that were concerning or favorable. Some counties had low rates of pressure ulcers, or high rates of benzodiazepines; others had comparatively high emergency room rates among people with cognitive impairment, and not among people with functional impairment only. A few communities (such as Miami-Dade County) had high rates of nearly every medical misadventurea medical care system with high use and avoidable acute-care events, high use of potentially inappropriate medications, high rates of fall-related injuries, and high costs. For these communities, the data would suggest an urgent need for reinvestment toward eldercare improvement.Our partnering community entities usually wanted to understand how their metrics compared to the national distribution, or to peer counties.Leadership teams often wanted to review provider-level data. Several teams identified which providers served a large share of community residents with functional or cognitive disabilities or who were in the last year of life. One county team identified a handful of providers whose patients ages 65 and older faced particularly high risks of adverse events and belonged to a language-isolated subcommunity, meaning equitable outreach to the subcommunity could be more effective by providing more support to and working with these providers. In all cases, the nature of our collaborators interest in provider-level data was collaborative and supportive. Among those interested in provider-level data were county public health departments and accountable care organizations.The projects we supported ranged from a falls prevention program to a dyadic support program for people with dementia and their caregivers. Across every project, the data found an immediate use by informing leaders to target a specific area, population, or provider. The data also motivated financial discussions: in one case, the data bolstered an Area Agency on Agings value story for its post-hospital transitional services program with a local hospital by showing the post-acute care experiences among people living with disabilities. We shared the data with a variety of state and regional agencies concerned with aging, and each found insights that helped to guide targeting of topics and resources.LimitationsThis test of concept work had important constraints, and other factors may constrain wider data access in the future. A first constraint limited our impact: our data came to be available during the pandemic, when many of our partners faced overwhelming demands. Most could not continue their level of effort on eldercare improvement. Another constraint relates to the data itself: available data does not include direct insights into caregiver experience, family and financial impacts of eldercare, or workforce challenges. These shortcomings probably require local data collection at this point.Except for falls, our data was limited to a year or two before the pandemic, which is now too outdated to be directly useful. One of us (Franco) intends to update these data and to encourage other analysts to develop similar resources. While creating the datasets and data dashboards proved intensive at first, the maintenance cost of using and updating the data would be small, especially when running the numbers for many communities.We worked with Traditional Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older. Analysts now can work with more timely data and some data from Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), and perhaps even the Veterans Health Care System. Future work should test and likely improve on this use of MDS and OASIS assessments. Future work also should respond to the felt needs and observed utilization of these data, provided they are made broadly available.More broadly, CMS policies on research data access could hinder some of the eldercare improvement analytics discussed here. Logistical and financial hurdles for gaining access to CMS data are considerable, and barriers that data providers face could translate to higher prices for data analytics, making those analytics less accessible to under-resourced communities. These hurdles may rise soon, as CMS plans to eliminate its lowest-cost pathways for research data access in favor of more secure but costlier pathways (CMS, 2024). Additionally, gaining access to CMS research data requires that analysts request the minimum necessary data for the minimum necessary population under health information privacy laws.Generating nationwide but locally specific metrics on a wide range of topics in eldercare requires a large scope of CMS data files, and analysts must make a compelling case for accessing each data file. Our experience analyzing CMS research data to inform a wide variety of eldercare improvement projects suggests that these constraints are navigable, but they may limit the supply of data providers available to enable our vision.DiscussionGood eldercare depends upon the reliable availability of adequate supply and quality of a variety of services and supports to all older adults who need them. Remarkably, the data to guide the assessment of local performance and of the effects of eldercare improvement projects could be made available in a timely manner, affordably, and repeatedly. Unlike most countries, the United States would need to develop entities capable of managing aspects of the local populations experience of living with disabilities in advanced age. This responsibility and opportunity might build on the Area Agencies on Aging as well as other governmental or voluntary entities. But the challenge of having no useful and reliable data about the local performance of eldercare arrangements, as our partnering communities faced, is now surmountable.This intersection of eldercare improvement and data provision will be a fertile arena for research, including how best to develop the metrics and which improvement activities work well. While some issues will be best addressed with randomized controlled trials and similar formal studies, most initiatives may well require a form of realist evaluation, with awareness of the role of the specific context in a particular community and how the proposed mechanism of improvement interacts to achieve the outcomes (Pawson & Tilley, 1997). Aggregating these experiences thoughtfully will yield wisdom as to what works in which contexts and with what likely effects.Providing services to persons with substantial disabilities living in a defined geographic community is the standard in many other countries.This sort of societal intervention research is powerful and critically important but has been downplayed for the past half-century in pursuit of generalizable research findings. Of course, some immediately generalizable research will arise and will be valuable, but much of what we need is the aggregate wisdom that comes from a large body of work that arises from trying things out with good monitoring and evaluation.Providing services to persons with substantial disabilities living in a defined geographic community is the standard in many other countries. The United States is hamstrung by a belief in competition and by anti-trust traditions. But having dozens of providers caring for patients in residences in any one community guarantees inefficienciesminimum times on site, transportation and parking burdens, inept coordination with and development of other local services, and so on. The United States cannot enable development of local monitoring and management of the arrangements for eldercare (and disability generally) without overcoming those inhibitions and without reliable, timely, and useful data.In our work, we have seen communities cooperate meaningfully to address and monitor shared problems. The United States could now develop the needed data, using the approaches outlined above. Next steps include generating, funding, and staffing the coalitions (which may include governmental authorities) set up to develop improvement activities guided by these data. With such an approach, we could see substantial gains in the efficiency and reliability of care for older adults living with disabilities in each geographic area.Many more eldercare improvement projects will arise in the coming years to support people with disabilities, as needs increase alongside trends in population aging. The value and scale of eldercare improvements will depend upon setting the right aims, targeting the right bottlenecks, supporting individuals with the most need, and collaborating across traditional silos.These data can helpby identifying new organizations and providers that share an interest in these improvements, by promoting a shared focus on crucial problems, and by fostering payment arrangements that reflect the interdependence of community-based organizations with the medical entities that have financial incentives to manage population healthcare use. Multisector collaborations can level financial imbalances between sectors by using these data to design shared-payment arrangements, like those piloted in the Collaborative Approach to Public Good Investments (CAPGI) program (Nichols et al., 2020).Our work also establishes how the data can help shape government programs and policies. The continued monitoring of key indicators of quality and access will provide a reality check for the improvement projects undertaken by each community. The targets and improvement mechanisms may well vary by community, and local entities should bring their own expertise and data to bear on the problems. However, meaningful use of these data, anchored in Medicare and Medicaid, could be pivotal in coordinating eldercare improvements in every community.Nils Franco is a senior analyst at ATI Advisory in Washington, DC.

Despite the older adult populations significant growth, there is little information about how best to increase their mental health literacy. This article will provide a brief overview of the historical and current underpinnings of mental health literacy, methods by which mental health literacy is gauged, and examples of effective strategies to improve older adults mental health literacy. Also, it will recommend ways to identify and advance effective strategies to build elders mental health literacy.Key Words:mental health literacy, positive mental health literacy, eMental health literacy, education entertainment, serious gamesFirst introduced more than 25 years ago, the termmental health literacyrefers to knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management or prevention (Sampaio et al., 2022). Mental health literacy comprises multiple elements, including: The ability to recognize specific disorders or different types of psychological distress; knowledge and beliefs about risk factors and causes; knowledge and beliefs about self-help interventions; knowledge and beliefs about professional help available; attitudes which facilitate recognition and appropriate help-seeking; and knowledge of how to seek mental health information (Jorm, 2000).But in recent years, an additional element of mental health literacy has been proposed, defined as, understanding how to obtain and maintain good mental health (Sampaio, et al., 2022). As in the original definition of mental health literacy, this newer idea includes multiple components: Competence in problem-solving and self-actualization; personal satisfaction; autonomy; relatedness and interpersonal relationship skills; self-control; and a prosocial attitude (Carvalho et al., 2022).Several tools have been developed to assess mental health literacy, including the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire (MHLq), which has been used with younger adolescents and young adults (Dias et al., 2018), as well as an adapted, shorter form of the MHLq used with adults (MHLq-SVa; Campos et al., 2022). These instruments focus on the elements of the original definition of mental health literacy, which concentrates on identifying signs of mental illness and beliefs about treatment and help-seeking. An additional instrument, the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS), was developed to assess positive mental health literacy, and can be used with adults (OConnor & Casey, 2015).Mental Health Literacy and Older AdultsIt is widely recognized that older adults represent an increasing percentage of the total population, a trend that is anticipated to continue for at least another decade. Data from the 2020 Census indicates that from 2010 to 2020, the U.S. population ages 65 or older grew 5 times faster than the total population across the 100 years between 1920 and 2020, reaching 16.8% of the total U.S. population. In other words, 1 in 6 people in the United States fall within this age group. Much of this growth is the result of the aging of the Baby Boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964), who began turning age 65 in 2011 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2023).But despite the tremendous growth in this population and the continued research interest in mental health literacy, there has been very little investigation into the mental health literacy of older adults, as most of the literature is focused on adolescents (Sampaio et al., 2022).There has been very little investigation into the mental health literacy of older adults.What, then, do we know about the mental literacy of older adults, and what does that knowledge imply about effective practices to increase it?Existing literature indicates that the mental health literacy of older and younger adults differs in terms of their respective abilities to identify symptoms of mental disorders and their beliefs in the efficacy of treatment. In one study, researchers found that younger adults were better able to recognize the symptoms of depression than were older adults, and younger adults endorsed the value of informal supports over formal treatment, while older adults indicated they saw less value overall in any form of support (Farrer et al., 2008).Also, older adults are less likely than younger populations to seek formal mental health services. Barriers to help-seeking associated with lower mental health literacy include, but are not limited to, concerns about stigma and negative feelings about mental health services (Elshaikh et al., 2023). Lower mental health literacy is also found among older adults with lower levels of educational attainment, a lack of prior contact with mental health professionals, and a lack of perceived need for treatment services for emotional distress (Elshaikh et al., 2023).Approaches to mental health literacy intervention are not necessarily universally applicable and must consider language, culture, and other determinants that may influence older adults willingness to seek out mental health supports. At present, there is a dearth of widely available interventions that have been demonstrated to be effective in multiple languages or across multiple cultures. There also is a relative lack of mental health literacy interventions that have been demonstrated to be effective with speakers of certain languages other than English, or for older adults from specific cultural groups and/or ethnicities.InterventionsSeveral strategies and interventions have been developed to improve mental health literacy in varied populations. While the majority do not explicitly focus on older adults, there are older adultspecific interventions that can be promulgated. Also, intervention approaches that have demonstrated success among younger adults may hold promise if adapted for an older audience. Examples of interventions focused on, or adaptable for, older adults include, but are not limited to: integration of mental health assessment and treatment into healthcare programs, increasing older adults ability to access and understand online information about mental health, using education-entertainment strategies, and developing serious games focused on increasing mental health literacy.Integration of Physical and Mental Health CareOlder adults, who often manage multiple medical comorbidities, are frequent users of primary and specialty care. Primary care offers an entre into mental health care that might otherwise be avoided (Lopez et al., 2018). While many older adults have lower levels of mental health literacy and, as a result, may shun contact with specialized mental health services, most older adults regularly encounter healthcare personnel and may be more willing to discuss mental health challenges with them, particularly if mental health education is given in a familiar setting.Community health workers can be trained to provide supportive mental health services.One successful example of this approach is the House Calls and Behavioral Health Integration project, a collaboration between medical providers, aging services, and social services in New Jersey. In this approach, older adults in senior housing were provided mental health education, depression screening, and connections to services such as case management and/or supportive counseling. This enabled older adults to receive mental health information in an environment where they were comfortable and increased the acceptability of receiving mental health services and supports (Perweiler et al., 2019).There also is evidence that community health workers can be trained to provide supportive mental health services. Increased use of community health workers may be particularly valuable in providing mental health information in a culturally appropriate way to older adults who otherwise might not seek evaluation and treatment (Weaver & Lapidos, 2018).Improving eMental Health LiteracyAs information and mental health supports are increasingly delivered online, the concept of eMental Health has arisen. This is understood as, the degree to which individuals obtain, process, and understand basic mental health information online to inform mental health-related decisions (Root & Caskie, 2023).A systematic review published in 2016 indicates that online mental health information delivered via the Internet can increase mental health literacy efficaciously. The most promising Internet-based interventions included those that involved active user engagement through providing a structured program or other interactive and experiential approaches, contained population-specific information and approaches, and provided evidence-based information (Brijnath et al., 2016).A Pew Research Center report noted that while the digital divide is closing among older adults, a significant gap remains between the oldest and the youngest users of the Internet (Faviero, 2022). Contributing factors to this divide include a lack of access to computers or smartphones, lack of access to broadband (particularly in rural areas), and lack of familiarity with how to use search engines to find accurate information.Game-based learning is one approach that can be effective at increasing older adults mental health literacy.More must be done to increase older adults ability to connect online, including boosting the availability of broadband and providing cost-effective technology and instruction on its use. Many older adults also would benefit from being trained on general Internet use and Internet-based technologies, particularly if the training content is provided in the languages older adults speak and the training is delivered by linguistically and culturally competent instructors.Education EntertainmentHealth information that is purely informational or educational is rarely effective in helping to change behaviors. Education-entertainment, or edu-tainment (EE), is described as, The placement of educational messages in entertainment contexts, and has been shown to be effective in influencing knowledge, attitudes and behavior toward health-related issues (Asbeek Brusse & Fransen, 2017), including increasing mental health literacy.This approach is particularly adaptable to be culturally relevant among different populations (Cabassa et al., 2015). For example, a 2021 study of an EE video intervention in the form of a telenovela increased the mental health literacy of Latina adults when compared to traditional print approaches (Gonzalez & Benuto, 2022).Serious GamesGame-based learning is another approach that can be effective at increasing older adults mental health literacy. Games that foster problem-solving and skill-building are known as serious games, and are most frequently developed in video game formats. One example of a serious game designed to increase the health and mental health literacy of older adults is Age-tastic! developed by the New York City Department for the Aging.Age-tastic!is a health and wellnessfocused board game that can be implemented with facilitation across an 8-week period. A pilot study conducted to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention demonstrated statistically significant increases in older adults mental health literacy about depression and help-seeking (Berman et al., 2020).Conclusion: What Can We Do?To support older adults mental health literacy and increase their potential for accessing treatment, it will be critical to invest in the following strategies:Further research to determine what interventions are most effective with older adults;Ensure that intervention approaches are delivered using methods with which older adults are most likely to engage;Identify whether intervention strategies need to be segmented for different cohorts of older adults (i.e., the youngest Baby Boomers versus the oldest);Develop and promulgate approaches that are relevant and effective across cultures and among different groups of older adults;Promote the continued integration of physical and mental health care, which, while already in the works, is still not consistently available to older adults;Integrate interventions into the services where older adults are most likely to seek any information or services outside of healthcare (i.e., aging services programs, community centers, older adult residential programs, etc.); and,Advance the use of culturally appropriate technological approaches to mental health education.As is often said, knowledge is power. Empowering older adults to seek and accept mental health services and supports when they need them will require multiple strategies. Mental health literacy, or knowledge about mental health and mental illness, is not an exclusive driver of help-seeking behavior in any population, including older adults. However, increased awareness of mental health and symptoms of mental illness, among other related topics, can help lay the foundation for future connections to clinical treatment and other services and supports.The behavioral health sector continually seeks to innovate clinical interventions and improve methods of service delivery. The same effort must be made to encourage the development of mental health literacy among the fastest growing segment of the population.Lisa Furst, LMSW, MPH, is chief program officer of Vibrant Emotional Health and has more than 20 years experience in the mental health service sector.

Raue and Kiana SeresinheApril 24, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingInnovation & Social ImpactAbstract:In task-sharing models, specific mental health tasks typically delivered by a licensed mental health clinician are assigned instead to a non-licensed individual. These approaches may address unmet mental health needs in rural and other low-resource areas. A growing body of evidence supports the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of task sharing. Do More, Feel Better (DMFB) is an example of a mental health task-sharing approach for older adults with elevated depressive symptoms. DMFB is a streamlined behavioral activation program provided virtually by older adult peers, other volunteers, and social work interns who have been certified as coaches.Key Words:task sharing, lay health counselor, late-life depression, telehealth, mental health servicesDepression has been identified as a leading cause of personal suffering, disability, and rising healthcare costs (Liu et al., 2020). There are substantial gaps, however, in the availability of mental health treatment across the United States, particularly for older adults. The reality is that few older adults with depression receive any sort of mental health treatment (Olfson et al., 2016). Lack of mental health care is due to many factors, including limited availability of geriatric mental health providers and lack of services that older adults find acceptable.Task-sharing models have been proposed as one solution to address this treatment gap and represent an innovative way to offer acceptable and effective mental health services to older adults with mental health conditions. For example, landmark reports from the Institute of Medicine (2012) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) have recommended building up the workforce of nontraditional providers (SAMHSA, 2012). In task-sharing models, specific mental health tasks typically delivered by licensed mental health clinicians are assigned instead to non-licensed individuals or lay staff who have received appropriate training. These types of task-sharing approaches were first developed and tested in a number of low- and middle-income countries, such as India and Nigeria. Such efforts have typically involved training lay health providers, or those without formal mental health expertise, to provide specific brief behavioral interventions.Research has documented that such task-sharing interventions are feasible, acceptable, and effective in treating and preventing depression. For example, the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) used lay counselors for a 6- to 8-week behavioral activation intervention delivered in 10 primary health centers in Goa, India (Singla et al., 2019). In rural Zimbabwe, village health workers were trained to deliver a 6-session problem-solving intervention designed for pregnant women with symptoms of depression. The Friendship Bench intervention used in the study was based upon Indigenous concepts of problem-solving such as uplifting, strengthening, and engaging the mind (Fernando et al., 2021).Task-sharing approaches also have been implemented in high-income countries, most notably Englands National Health Service Talking Therapies (formerly known as Improving Access to Psychological Therapies; Wakefield et al., 2021). In this stepped-care program, patients are offered low-intensity mental health services before consideration for stepping up to a higher level of intervention. The low-intensity component of Talking Therapies makes use of Psychological Well-being Practitioners (PWPs). PWPs are non-specialists with some college or equivalent background who are trained to deliver brief structured behavioral interventions, conceptualized as a form of guided self-help. Only those patients who have high levels of functional impairment, more severe disorders, or who do not respond to lower intensity services are offered higher intensity services such as psychotherapy. This Talking Therapies model has shown clinical benefit to both mid-life and older adults (Prina et al., 2014).Task sharing has great potential to support the reach and depth of mental health services.Researchers in the United States also have begun to develop and test task-sharing models, in particular for older adults with depression or generalized anxiety. This emerging evidence suggests that lay health, peer, and bachelors-level providers may achieve clinical outcomes comparable to professional psychotherapists (Choi et al., 2020; Raue et al., 2019). Below, we highlight our own task-sharing program called Do More, Feel Better (DMFB) for community-dwelling older adults with depression (Raue et al., 2019, 2021).Task sharing thus has great potential to support the reach and depth of mental health services. An important additional benefit is that licensed clinicians are able to focus on and use their advanced skills (i.e., psychotherapy) for individuals with more severe mental health conditions. Task-sharing approaches thereby provide opportunities for more individuals at all levels of need to receive services. Task sharing can be particularly helpful in addressing unmet mental health needs in rural and other low-resource areas where there are a limited number of licensed clinicians.Opportunities for Task Sharing in Care Settings for Older AdultsSenior centers and other care settings for elders offer opportunities to provide acceptable mental health services to older adults, a vulnerable and underserved group. We know that individuals who attend senior centers represent large numbers of mid- to low-income older adults with multiple social service needs, nutritional insecurity, and financial vulnerability (Administration on Aging, 2016). We also know that 10% to 25% of older adults who make use of senior center programs or services experience clinically significant depression (Raue et al., 2019; Sirey et al., 2020).Currently, most centers throughout the country do not conduct mental health screening or offer treatment. And if depression is identified among older adults, few accept mental health referrals or engage in treatment (Gum et al., 2014; Sirey, 2013). However, there are opportunities to integrate mental health services within senior centers and aid them in fulfilling their mission to help older adults live in their community as independently as possible.Task-sharing models as described above may hold particular promise to be implemented within senior centers and other care settings for older adults. Task sharing would be expected to be less costly than interventions delivered by licensed clinicians, equally effective in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms, and equally or more acceptable to older adults experiencing depression compared to clinician-delivered interventions. The acceptability of task-sharing approaches to those in need may be due to meeting with peers from their own community who understand them and can empathize with their experience. Along those lines, using volunteer or peer providers in the community provides opportunities to better serve the growing population of culturally diverse older adults.Do More, Feel Better: A Task-sharing Intervention in Senior CentersWe have developed a streamlined Behavioral Activation intervention called Do More, Feel Better for older adults experiencing depression. We engaged in task sharing of Behavioral Activation in two different projects, a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) grant focused on testing the intervention provided by trained older lay health volunteers or peers (R01MH124975) and an ACL grant focused on implementing the intervention by both younger and older volunteers and by social work interns (90INNU0027). The development of DMFB was inspired by task-sharing models in low- and middle-income countries; our goal is to grow a sustainable workforce capable of providing geriatric mental health services in community settings in the United States such as senior centers.We have found Do More, Feel Better to be feasible as delivered by trained older adult peer volunteers for older adults with depression.We chose Behavioral Activation as the basis for DMFB given strong evidence for its broad use and documented effectiveness among older adults from many backgrounds (Dimidjian et al., 2011). Behavioral Activation has also been shown to be a good fit for older adults with low education levels or mild cognitive impairment. The theoretical model of Behavioral Activation proposes that depression is maintained due to consistent reduction in positively reinforcing events (Martell et al., 2013). The depressed mood that results then leads to further avoidance and withdrawal from activities, which creates a downward spiral that further increases inactivity, isolation, rumination, and low mood. Behavioral Activation intervention strategies thus include a focus on eliciting personal values, activity monitoring, and planning rewarding activities, all of which can counteract the depressive tendency to withdraw, be inactive, and isolate oneself.While retaining the key therapeutic strategies of Behavioral Activation, we simplified and manualized the intervention to better match the skill set of lay health providers and volunteers. Also, we shortened the number of sessions from as many as 20 in some settings to nine brief sessions. A fundamental component of the DMFB intervention is helping older adults increase their engagement in rewarding and meaningful activities. DMFB retains the following core Behavioral Activation strategies:providing psychoeducation about depression;discussing the rationale for engaging in rewarding activities;helping the older adult brainstorm and plan enjoyable and rewarding activities to pursue in between meetings;helping the older adult review prior plans, reflecting on satisfaction levels and troubleshoot any barriers;creating new weekly activity plans for the coming week; anddiscussing relapse prevention or a stay well plans toward the end of the program.We have pilot tested DMFB in senior centers as delivered by trained older adult peer volunteers for older adults with depression and found to be it to be feasible and acceptable (Raue et al., 2019, 2021). We also have successfully implemented DMFB in an Administration on Community Living grant to address associated depressive symptoms of older adults in New York City experiencing nutritional insecurity. This implementation project trained volunteers, older adult peers, and social work interns to serve as coaches.Outreach Strategies for Identifying VolunteersVolunteers, peers, and interns are selected based upon their interest in providing the DMFB program and for their strong interpersonal and organizational skills. We have experimented with several strategies for conducting outreach to identify qualified individuals and have had optimal success implementing three primary methods. The first strategy is a direct referral from senior center directors or a trusted and authorized individual.The second strategy involves posting flyers, online announcements, or providing a formal outreach presentation of the project to the community to identify potential volunteer coaches. The final strategy uses internal partnerships, where existing volunteer coaches connect our team with community members. These outreach strategies highlight the importance of securing community collaboration when identifying lay health providers appropriate for task-sharing efforts like DMFB. Other implementation projects may recruit interns from various fields such as social work or nutrition, which can provide early training for those interested in developing early clinical skills.Training, Certification, and SupervisionLicensed mental health or social work professionals who have been designated as master DMFB trainers can provide training and ongoing supervision for lay health volunteers, peers, and interns. Training encompasses four virtual two-hour sessions over 24 weeks and is designed to teach DMFB by using demonstration, roleplay, and instructional webinars. Formal certification as a coach involves individual role play of DMFB session 1 to fidelity standards. To this end, we have created a volunteer fidelity form that assesses fundamental components for administering the intervention.Subsequently, coaches began an initial case where their ability to deliver DMFB was ensured by a supervisor. Coaches participate in weekly group supervision where cases are discussed in detail and in-session paperwork reviewed. The supervision meetings not only enhance quality of care delivery and fidelity to DMFB but also have fostered a sense of community within the group, allowing participants to exchange best practices and support each other.Ongoing EffortsWe are conducting a large definitive study funded by the NIMH to establish to evidence base for DMFB. Participating academic sites are the University of Washington, Weill Cornell Medical College (New York City), and University of South Florida (Tampa Bay region). Across the three sites, 288 English-speaking and 96 Spanish-speaking older adults with depression are being enrolled. Half of eligible older adults will be randomized to receive DMFB, and half to receive clinician-delivered Behavioral Activation as a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of coach-delivered DMFB.The program gave me an ability to cope so thats what I really think helps so much and what I got out of it. It provided little steps.Most of our research activities have been conducted virtually, either via video conferencing or by telephone. The study is being conducted in partnership with eight senior centers per site, which assist with outreach and recruitment of volunteer coaches and older adults experiencing depression. Centers also have made physical space available for participants who prefer to meet in-person.Older adult participants and volunteer coaches have reported positive experiences to date across all our projects. Many older adult participants have reported reduced severity of their depressive symptoms after 9 weeks of DMFB. They also have reported becoming more active in many domains, including increasing the quality of their social connections, physical activity, and community and recreational activities. Participants report spending more time with family and friends, participating in their local senior center, gardening, helping others, and engaging in leisure activities they enjoy.Older adults have been able to become more active despite challenges that many typically face, such as chronic pain, difficulty getting around, being socially or physically isolated, experiencing grief over loss of loved ones, experiencing transitions in life such as retirement, and navigating COVID-related challenges. The following are select older adult testimonials:I didnt know this was something that would benefit me, but it definitely is.The program gave me an ability to cope so thats what I really think helps so much and what I got out of it. It provided little steps.[The program] benefited me by allowing me to do things for myself, being responsible for my life and doing things to help myself. I feel, to a certain extent, that it may have saved my life.Our volunteer coaches have reported enjoying learning the intervention and being able to help others who are experiencing depression. They also have valued engaging with each other during group training and ongoing supervision, consistent with building a community of people interested in helping others from their community. The following are select coach testimonials:You know, I really enjoyed meeting the people. I was honored that they had trust and confidence in me enough to be fairly personal and share their lives and their struggles. I was honored to have them as clients.I got something out of it too, in that these people gave me ideas and, you know, we shared information. So, it was helpful to me ... So much of the information that was exchanged was not just one way.I think this program is progress for older adults. The best part of the progress is that we are a part of it.Next StepsWhile we complete the current study across the next 2 years, we are preparing for larger-scale dissemination. This preparation acknowledges the importance of establishing sustainable procedures for training and supervision needs, and reliable methods to assure intervention fidelity and older adult appropriateness and safety. Toward this end, we have developed an implementation manual that includes resources for service organizations in the aging sector, including guidance and tools to select, train, and supervise DMFB coaches; identify eligible older adults and enroll them in DMFB; and conduct program evaluation.A small number of service organizations in aging outside the research study are piloting DMFB and conducting program evaluation, with ongoing technical assistance from our team.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpring 2024The Impact of Ageism on Elders' Mental HealthBy Tracey GendronApril 24, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:Ageism is a pervasive issue with profound implications for mental health. Negative stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes can lead to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression in older adults. Ageism can affect self-worth and self-esteem, making people more vulnerable to stress and mental health issues. However, there is hope in combating ageism through awareness, relationships, role models, and recognizing the uniqueness of each individual. Addressing ageism is crucial for creating a more inclusive and mentally healthy society that values and respects people of all ages.Key Words:ageism, mental health, aging anxietyRecently, I was in the audience at an event when the person on stage, having forgotten their glasses, said into the microphone, Dont get old, folks. The insidiousness of this offhand comment went largely unnoticed by the crowd. After all, people hear sentiments like this almost every day and frequently express similar thoughts to themselves. The message amplified to the crowd that day was, Getting older is bad.So what? you might say. Getting older is bad is right up there with the sky is blue or water is wet, isnt it? This oft-perpetuated myth is one of the first barriers one must overcome to recognize ageism. Aging is a complex process that includes growth, decline, development, adaptation, and loss. Falling prey to ageism can paradoxically hasten or manifest the very aspects of aging of which we were afraid.Ageism is a pervasive and often-overlooked form of discrimination that affects people at every stage of life. Ageism occurs when people judge, have preconceived notions about, or mistreat others based upon their age. It involves stereotypes, biases, and discriminatory behavior linked to how old someone is. These biases affect our thoughts, emotions, and actions. Ageism occurs unconsciously, in our thoughts and feelings, and consciously when we intentionally judge someone based on age (e.g., that person is too old to understand technology).Importantly, ageism is also directed inward when we have negative and limiting beliefs based upon age (e.g., I am too old to learn something new; I do not want people to know how old I am). This is called internalized or self-directed ageism, and it results from years of absorbing negative cultural messages about aging.I would place a wager that you have heard someone claim they are too old to try something new or make a significant change. These self-limiting beliefs are often learned. We are not born ageists; we are taught that old age is a time to be feared, a time of loss without gain, and that we better be careful because, wellDont get old, folks.Ageism results when we downplay the value of wisdom, knowledge and life experience that comes with aging.Negative cultural messages about aging drive ageism. These messages include youth-centric beauty and shame-based beauty standards that tell us to look our best; we need to look and feel younger. Ageism dictates that in older age, we are past our prime or over the hill. Media representation often portrays older people in limited and stereotypical roles, such as being forgetful or overly conservative. Ageism results when we downplay the value of wisdom, knowledge and life experience that comes with aging. All forms of ageism can lead to a lack of value for older people, making them feel irrelevant or unimportant to society.Ageism can manifest in various ways, from workplace discrimination to social exclusion. No matter the setting, ageisms impact on health is profound and far-reaching. The negative and limiting beliefs about growing older manifest in lowered self-esteem and confidence and make people vulnerable to increased stress (Orth et al., 2010). Ageism is increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to anxiety, depression, lowered life satisfaction, loneliness, and decreased physical and mental health (Bryant et al., 2012).While it may seem harmless to distance ourselves from identifying as old or to express shame or reluctance to share our age with others, it is anything but harmless. Feelings of shame, fear, anxiety, and dread about aging damage our opportunities for good health, happiness, and well-being. Decades of research demonstrate the profound influence of negative attitudes about aging on mental health. Here are just a few startling statistics:The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 6.3 million cases of depression worldwide can be attributed to the effects of ageism (WHO, 2021).Age discrimination affects financial strain, which increases womens depressive symptoms (Shippee et al., 2019).Internalized ageism is a risk factor for suicidal ideation (Gendron et al., 2023).Experiencing ageism increases the odds of poor mental health and depressive symptoms (Allen et al., 2022).Experiencing discrimination because of ones age can lead to chronic stress and anxiety. This stress can have a cumulative effect on mental health over time, contributing to conditions like anxiety disorders (Kang et al, 2022).Ageism can erode an individuals sense of self-worth and self-esteem. When people are consistently marginalized or made to feel undervalued, they may internalize these negative perceptions. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a loss of purpose, which can contribute to mental health issues and depression.In addition to ageisms direct impact on mental health, negative stereotypes about older people, such as being seen as out of touch or unproductive, can lead to exclusion from social activities, workplaces and even within families. Social isolation is an epidemic that causes loneliness and despair. Loneliness alone increases the risk of developing dementia by 50%, the risk of having a stroke by 30%, and mortality risk by 26% (Holt-Lundstad et al., 2015; Valtorta et al., 2016).Challenge your own preconceived notions about aging and being old and appreciate it as a crucial facet of personal growth.Through the exclusion of older people, ageism can exacerbate or even cause isolation and loneliness. In essence, ageism contributes to a vicious cycle of chronic rejection. Notably, othering also can be self-imposed due to internalized ageism. We can self-embody the stereotypes of old age and remove ourselves from social situations with thoughts such as, At my age, what could I possibly contribute? or, I am afraid that people will ignore me when I speak.The resulting fear and discomfort keep older people from actively participating in social gatherings and events. What is essential to understand is that even self-imposed isolation can be unwanted and lonely. Ageism and loneliness often co-occur, and combined, they can increase psychological distress (Ribeiro-Gonalves et al., 2023). One thing we all learned during the COVID-19 pandemic was the vital importance of sustaining social relationships for our mental and physical health.While there is ample evidence that negative attitudes about aging are bad for physical and mental health, there also is evidence that the inverse is true. Research shows that people with high psychological well-being who are proud of their age experience fewer negative emotions, are more optimistic about their future, and are more self-confident about their physical bodies (Kang & Kim, 2022).Aging has its perks, which can protect us and help us develop resilience in later life. Resilience, the ability to recover quickly from difficulties and challenges, has been found to buffer the impact of ageism and protect mental health among older adults (Ribeiro-Gonalves et al., 2023). The challenges we encounter throughout our lives help us develop robust coping mechanisms that buffer the impact of ageism. There are beautiful and vital benefits that come with age, such as the ability for integrative thinking, an increased sense of well-being (even with chronic conditions and morbidity!), lower stress, and easier recovery from adversity (MacLeod et al., 2016).Raising your awareness of ageism can help you identify self-limiting thoughts and potentially enhance your perspective on aging. Do you find yourself saying, Im not old; Im just experienced? If so, take a moment to reflect on the concept of aging.Old can encompass many qualities, such as wisdom and knowledge. Recognize that everything you have encountered in your journey to becoming who you are today is an integral part of your aging process. It is important to remember that the issue lies not in being old but in the social values attached to it. With this awareness, you can challenge your own preconceived notions about aging and being old and instead appreciate it as a crucial facet of personal growth.Also, there are essential steps we can all take to reduce the impact of ageism to promote a more inclusive society that promotes good mental health for all ages.Develop a solid social network of friends (of all ages!). Relationships help people cope with the effects of ageism by promoting a sense of belonging.Remember that age is relative. Being older or younger than someone else can be judgment-free. Instead of using the words old and young with value, remove any bias by referencing age about yourselfas in, younger than or older than.Seek out a role modelor become one. Having positive role models of all ages can provide guidance and inspiration. It is especially impactful to have a role model that is younger and one that is older than you.Think individually. When you have met one person who is 80you have met one person who is 80. Remember that age alone does not tell you anything meaningful about someone. We are all the products of our individual and unique life experiences.Ageism is not just a matter of societal prejudice; it has far-reaching implications for mental health. As a society, addressing ageism is a matter of ethical concern and essential for promoting the mental health and well-being of people across the age spectrum. By challenging our views of aging, we can create a more inclusive and mentally healthy society where people are valued and respected. It is our collective responsibility to create a world where ageism no longer casts a shadow over our ability to thrive as we grow old.Tracey Gendron, PhD, is chair for the Virginia Commonwealth University Department of Gerontology and executive director of the Virginia Center on Aging.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpring 2024The Ibasho Model of Elder Empowerment and Community OwnershipBy Emi Kiyota, Christy Nishita, Yasuhiro Tanaka, Erin Ah Sue, and Helen TurnerApril 24, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:Aging is conventionally viewed as a process of decline, which marginalizes a fast-growing part of the worlds population and is detrimental to elders mental health. In contrast, the Ibasho model, led by eight core principles, empowers elders to co-create a community space where they lead in social and economic activities that benefit their neighbors and build social capital. There is a growing societal need for elder-led community initiatives like Ibasho, particularly as communities recover from harmful social and economic impacts of COVID-19 and look to develop community models that foster mental and emotional well-being and resilience.Key Words:elder empowerment, resilience, community development, older adults, inclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic took a disproportionate toll on older adults, who were vulnerable to marginalization, social exclusion, and loneliness (Dcruz & Banerjee, 2020). The Ibasho model described here offers an approach to address these challenges by empowering elders as change agents while infusing their lives with increased meaning and purpose, which are foundational to mental health. This approach has proven particularly effective in communities that are recovering from natural disasters, by providing older people with opportunities to teach younger generations how to survive without modern conveniences and in resource-constrained settings (Aida et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2022). It empowers elders to co-create a community space where they lead in the development of activities and operations to benefit their neighbors, with concomitant positive effects on social connectedness and community resilience.Ibasho Model Core PrinciplesThe Ibasho model empowers elders as active participants in changing the harmful outcomes created by societys negative perceptions and expectationssocial isolation, a loss of dignity and respect, and a sense of uselessness and irrelevance. In turn, the model improves the communitys ability to withstand shocks caused by natural hazards by creating a strong informal support system in which elders are the catalysts to strengthen social capital among community members of all ages. Maintaining a sense of personal agency may be a challenge in late life (Heckhausen et al., 2019), especially among those with limited choice or independence due to age-related health changes. The Ibasho model builds a strong sense of agency among older adults, individually and collectively, to feel empowered and to be able to actively participate and contribute to community life.Given this theoretical grounding, Ibasho has developed the following eight core principles to provide a moral and philosophical foundation:Older people are a valuable asset to the community, can contribute to the society with confidence, and are leaned on and valued.Create informal gathering places that foster normalcy as opposed to institutional settings.Community members share a sense of ownership and pride, which drive development and implementation.All generations are connected and older and younger generations learn from one another.De-marginalization: All individuals, regardless of capacity, participate in community life.Local culture and traditions are respected.Communities are environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable and resilient.Growth of the community is organic, and embraces imperfection and change gracefully.Ibasho Sites in OperationThe Ibasho model was pioneered in Japan after the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) of 2011. Following the devastation, older people wanted to contribute and do something useful to help their town of Ofunato to recover. Older adults and other community members planned and built a community hub, an Ibasho Caf, which is restoring the fabric of a community still recovering from the disaster. Older adults lead in all aspects of the cafes operations and programming.In its first 6 years of operation, the Ibasho Caf in Japan served more than 70,000 people and hosted more than 5,250 events, at which elders shared their knowledge with younger generations by cooking traditional foods, organizing a farmers market and afterschool care for school children, and teaching young people how to use old equipment without electricity.In its first six years of operation, Ibasho Caf in Japan served more than 70,000 people and hosted more than 5,250 events.That model was then replicated in two other post-disaster areasOrmoc, Philippines, and Matatirtha, Nepalwith financial support from the World Bank and technical assistance from Japanese older adults and technical experts who shared the knowledge they had gained in establishing and maintaining Ibasho cafes. The sites in the Philippines and Nepal developed an evacuation map and risk-management plan and worked on income-generating activities to ensure their programs were self-sustaining. They serve as gathering places where ideas are generated for new community programs such as eco-tourism, cultural cooking classes, handicrafts, plastic recycling, and community beautification projects.During the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults at the Ibasho sites were quick to adapt and creative in supporting other community members. For example, in Japan, older adults started a catering business, creating and delivering bento boxes of food to older persons in their homes. Tables and chairs also were placed outside so community members could stop by and have socially distanced conversations. In Nepal, most households are multigenerational; during the pandemic, a program was started for younger persons in the house to teach older people how to use smart phones and other technology. In the Philippines, the Ibasho Caf developed a project to feed children in the local community.Adopting the Ibasho ModelA community that is interested in implementing an Ibasho Caf must first determine its readiness to take on this initiative and convene an initial team of older adults. The founder, Dr. Emi Kiyota, works with community elders. Elders who are willing to take leading roles in the creation and realization of their communitys Ibasho Caf site are identified through a process of engagement and discussion. This site may be co-designed and built from the ground up or an existing site can be repurposed as an Ibasho Caf. Regardless, the operations and structure of the Ibasho Caf site must be aligned with Ibasho principles.Dr. Kiyota and her team provide ongoing technical support and assistance to committed sites and local leaders, monitor fidelity to Ibasho principles, and connect Ibasho Caf leaders for networking and sharing of lessons learned. To ensure long-term sustainability, the Ibasho site should function as a sustainable organization with support from the local government (e.g., regulatory, information technology, legal), which can help the elders manage the site. For example, the local government in Ofunato, Japan, provided financial and logistics support in establishing the Ibasho Caf as a nonprofit organization. The government also provided legal advice to elder leaders on building the Ibasho Caf site in a post-disaster period.IbashoMeasurements and ImpactTo date, the Ibasho sites in Japan, Nepal, and the Philippines have sustained their leadership, programming, and community engagement. An impact evaluation conducted with all three sites at regular intervals assessed the impact of Ibasho participation on social capital. Specifically, researchers examined the levels of self-efficacy for those who went to the Ibasho Caf regularly (daily or weekly) versus those who did not. Findings indicated that those who attended Ibasho had self-efficacy scores 0.25 higher on a scale of 0 to 4 than those who did not attend (p < .10).In addition, individuals who were at the caf on a regular basisdaily or weeklyreported a moderately higher number of friends (2.3 on a 0 to 4 scale, p < .10) and a deeper connection to their neighborhood (p < .10; Kiyota et al. 2015). These findings demonstrate the social connectedness created by the Ibasho Caf, which are critical for emotional and mental well-being.Opportunities for Continued Evolution of IbashoIbasho and COVID-19 Community RebuildingEvents such as the pandemic can fuel a deficit narrative that older adults are weak and in need of help. In the wake of COVID-19, communities must rebuild social capital and reframe views of older adults as assets with lived experience and knowledge. As communities look to build resilience and strengthen social capital, older adults can play active roles in planning for natural disasters and climate change.Local planners can employ inclusive approaches so elders can express issues and concerns about natural disasters and be part of developing solutions. Although older adults are most at risk during climate change because of decreased mobility and other physical changes, they are not just vulnerable to environmental threats but rather can be empowered to become older environmentalists with the right inclusive community development approaches (Pillemer et al., 2021).Elders are not just vulnerable to environmental threats but rather can be empowered to become older environmentalists.Conceptually, Ibashos central understanding of aging as socially constructed and the Ibasho core principle of respect for local culture and traditions allows for flexibility in culturally adapting Ibasho sites. As we work with communities in Pacific Island locales including Hawaii, new enculturation opportunities will emerge. Hawaii is a priority site because of the potential for Ibasho to contribute to community resilience in locations that are facing existential threats from climate change and a rapidly increasing incidence of extreme weather events (Lee et al., 2022).Moreover, Hawaii specifically has unique aging issuesthe state is aging more rapidly than the rest of the United States and its geographic location blends Asian-Pacific and United States values with Native Hawaiian cultural values. While familial and volunteer opportunities exist, opportunities for older adults to be empowered leaders and mentors, and to give back to younger generations, are a new dimension contributed by Ibasho as part of a Pacific expansion phase.Ibasho is a validated model that is self-sustaining, restoring an independent role for elders and furthering an interdependent role in society, while requiring minimal support from the government. As we enter a strategic expansion phase, the Ibasho model will continue to focus on elder empowerment and leadership, on advocating for the contribution that Ibasho can make to individuals mental health and well-being and community resilience, and on enculturating within new contexts.Emi Kiyota, PhD, is founder of the Ibasho Organization in Singapore.

But few victims are offered mental health care, and there are no standardized, effective programs to address their specific mental health needs. PROTECT, a manualized therapy offered as an adjunct to victim support services was developed and tested and is unique in its demonstrated effectiveness to reduce depression among victims. PROTECT, which is offered remotely (by video and phone), has been found to be effective, offering a shift in delivery that increases its potential dissemination beyond current use in New York City.Key Words:depression, mental health, elder abuse, crimeElder abuse is defined as a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person (World Health Organization, 2022, p. 1). In the United States, it is estimated that 1 in 10 older adults are victims of abuse (Acierno et al., 2010; Rosay & Mulford, 2017). According to a most recent prevalence study conducted in New York, 141 out of 1,000 older adults experienced elder abuse, with the highest rates of abuse occurring in New York City (Lachs & Berman, 2011). Elder abuse includes physical, sexual, financial, and psychological abuse, as well as caregiver neglect, and studies have shown that psychological and emotional abuse have the highest mean prevalence (Pillemer et al., 2016). Most elder abuse victims remain outside of formal institutional response systems and, when offered abuse resolution services, often underuse them.Sadly, depression is common among elder abuse victims: roughly a third of elder abuse victims also are depressed. Victims with depression have higher rates of mortality and nursing home placement (Dong et al., 2009; Lachs et al., 1998). There is a bidirectional relationship between depression and elder abuse, with victims showing higher rates of depression following abuse, and depressed individuals being more likely to experience abuse later in life.Circumstances that put older adults at risk for mistreatment and abuse were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. While necessary for public health concerns, social distancing and stay-at-home orders further isolated older adults at risk of elder mistreatment and greatly limited opportunities for in-person social engagement activities, as well as access to health and aging services (Chang & Levy, 2021; Elman et al., 2020). For example, many NYC agencies had to quickly shift from in-person service delivery to remote. Although agencies made efforts to maintain services during this time, there was a significant decrease in services in general, and in mental health services in particular (Liu et al., 2022).Research from the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic showed an 83.6% increase in elder abuse.While many older adults already deal with loneliness and lack of social support, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in social isolation, which is a demonstrated risk factor for elder mistreatment (Pillemer et al., 2016). The combination of an increase in social isolation and a shift in normal service delivery in healthcare settings, as well as aging services, increased older adults vulnerability. These circumstances posed greater challenges for older adults at risk of elder mistreatment, now confined to their home, potentially with their abuser and unable to access services.Research from the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic showed an 83.6% increase in elder abuse during the pandemic as compared to pre-pandemic estimates. Research shows that 1 in 5 (21.3%) older adults reported elder abuse in the beginning of the pandemic (Chang & Levy, 2021). This finding represents a dramatic change from pre-pandemic elder abuse prevalence reports, which estimated that 10% of older adults experienced mistreatment.The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted an already present immense need for effective and accessible mental health services for older adults, especially for victims of elder abuse. Additionally, it proved the need and potential for remotely delivered mental health interventions designed specifically for this vulnerable population.How Does Crime Affect Older Adults?Crime remains prevalent in the United States, with serious psychological consequences. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reported an increase in rates of violent victimizations in urban areas from 19.0 to 24.5 per 1,000 persons of all ages between 2020 and 2021 (Thompson & Tapp, 2022). Almost 10 of every 1,000 violent crimes were committed against adults ages 65 and older (Truman & Morgan, 2016). The psychological effects of crime victimization can range from short-term negative thoughts to long-term psychological distress, including guilt, shame, fear, isolation, heightened risk of alcohol or other drug use, suicidal ideation, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety (Boccellari et al., 2007; Wasserman & Ellis, 2007).In older adults, these difficulties can have lasting effects given concurrent life events, such as physical frailty or financial difficulties (Satchell et al., 2022; Serfaty et al., 2020). Despite the prevalence of crime against elders, few interventions or targeted services exist to address the mental health needs of these victims.Clients plan how they will spend their time each week in ways that maximize being with others and engaging in pleasurable activities.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was perceived on elder abuse victims as well as in crime against elders. While early pandemic research showed crime rates decreased in the first months of the pandemic, these decreases were mainly in violent crimes, theft, and burglaries (Abrams, 2021). Certain types of crime remained prevalent, such as fraud and identity theft.Older adults often were the victims of financial exploitation and fraud at the hands of scammers targeting a vulnerable and isolated population (Food and Drug Administration, 2023). Research showed that older adults accounted for 18% of pandemic fraud victims (Payne, 2020), and the financial losses incurred by this population were among the highest across age groups. Preying upon health anxieties, criminals took advantage of a socially isolated and vulnerable group.The COVID-19 pandemic also brought about an increase in hate crimes. Harmful negative biases toward Asian Americans were exacerbated by the pandemic, turning this community into the main target of rising hate crimes. Physical assaults and property damage against Asian Americans rose dramatically during the pandemic; and these crimes did not spare older adults. Often, older adults were targeted specifically, most likely due to their vulnerability and isolation (Takamura et al., 2022; Tessler et al., 2020). Studies have shown that the financial and psychological consequences of these crimes can have lasting effects (Serfaty et al., 2020).PROTECT TherapyWe developed PROTECT (Providing Options to Elderly Clients Together) in collaboration with our community partners at the Department for the Aging (NYC Aging) in New York City (Sirey et al., 2015). PROTECT is a 9-week therapy tailored to the needs and unique circumstances of older victims with depression or anxiety (Sirey et al., 2021). PROTECT was designed to address the impact of victims stress by setting goals, and to reduce symptoms of depression and/or anxiety by increasing engagement in pleasurable and rewarding activities, with an emphasis on social engagement.In sessions, clients set personalized goals they would like to achieve and create action plans to achieve each goal. For elder abuse victims, these goals can be to help them reduce vulnerability and set limits, and for victims of crime, to take steps to reduce the effects of the victimization. In addition, clients plan how they will spend their time each week in ways that maximize being with others and engaging in pleasurable activities, using worksheets to document their plans. Each session, therapist and client review the worksheets, track progress, and problem-solve together for any current obstacles.As mentioned above, during the pandemic, many services for older adults transitioned from in-person to remote delivery, including aging support and elder abuse services (Elman et al., 2020). Pre-pandemic studies had demonstrated that video-delivered therapy for older adults showed comparable results to those of traditional in-person therapy. To meet the needs of older adult victims of crime and abuse in this difficult time, and with the support of our funders at the Department of Justice and the National Institute of Mental Health, we shifted PROTECT to remote delivery (individual video or phone sessions).Does PROTECT Help Reduce Depression?You bet it does! Our group, in collaboration with our partners at NYC Aging, have tested PROTECT in carefully controlled research projects and in community service delivery projects. We summarize our work below.Elder Abuse VictimsOur recent research with elder abuse victims shows that PROTECT is effective in reducing depression symptoms and helping participants to feel better prepared to deal with their situations (Sirey et al., 2021). In one of our studies, we compared the effect of 9 weeks of our manualized PROTECT therapy delivered by a staff clinician to the usual care elder abuse victims with mental health needs receivea referral to a mental health provider. We found that victims receiving PROTECT got better faster than elder abuse victims who received a referral.Additionally, more than half (55%) of PROTECT participants showed a 50% or greater reduction in depression symptoms, compared to only 17% of participants receiving usual care. And a third (33%) of PROTECT participants no longer showed significant depressive symptoms after treatment. These results show the effectiveness of PROTECT in reducing depressive symptoms among elder abuse victims. Further, when client satisfaction was assessed, more than three-quarters of PROTECT participants reported having most or all of their needs met as compared to 35% of participants receiving usual care (Sirey et al., 2015).Older Crime VictimsThere is a lack of evidence-based interventions designed specifically for older crime victims dealing with depression and anxiety. With our collaborators at NYC Aging, we expanded PROTECT to serve older victims of crime, given increasing crime rates in New York City. At the end of 2021 we began offering mental health services via video and phone to older crime victims. Between 2021 and 2022, we served 31 older crime victims in Spanish, English, and Cantonese. Evaluating the impact on depression we found that more than two-thirds (67.7%) of crime victims receiving PROTECT showed clinically significant reductions in depression symptoms and felt less depressed after treatment. Further, we found that PROTECT reduced depression symptoms, regardless of gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the type and number of victimizations.We found that PROTECT reduced depression symptoms, regardless of gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the type and number of victimizations.PROTECT is an effective intervention to address the mental health needs of victims of crime and abuse. In collaboration with elder abuse and crime agencies that offer support services to address victimization, PROTECT has been shown to be a highly effective intervention to reduce depression symptoms in older adults. Furthermore, it is a simple and streamlined 9-week structured intervention that has the potential to be implemented by community social workers and gain high adherence rates.How Does PROTECT Work Remotely?The onset of the pandemic encouraged us to further enhance the remote delivery of PROTECT. From March 2020 onward, we delivered PROTECT to elder abuse and crime victims fully remotely. Clients chose to have their sessions via telephone or video and met remotely for 9 weeks with their clinician to receive the intervention.We compared the impact of PROTECT in reducing depression among elder abuse victims across different delivery modalities, which include in-person visits, telephone, or video sessions. Among a sample of 138 clients receiving PROTECTmost (70.3%) still in the abusive situation every participant showed significant depression reductions regardless of differences in age, race, and ethnicity, supporting our previous findings on the efficacy of PROTECT for elder abuse victims. On average, there was a reduction of more than 5 points on the depression severity scale (PHQ-9).Further, we found that all clients receiving PROTECT through the three delivery methods demonstrated statistically significant reduction of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) at the end of 9 weeks of treatment. Both video and phone delivery methods were as effective as in-person delivery in reducing depressive symptoms of elder abuse victims over the course of the intervention. Of note, most clients (91%) receiving sessions through mixed modalities (e.g., in-person and phone, or video and phone) completed all their sessions, while only 66% of those receiving phone-only sessions completed their course of therapy. Participants receiving in-persononly therapy largely (89%) completed treatment, as well as those receiving video-only sessions (85%). These findings support the importance of flexibility when offering services to older adults.What Can Be Done?Mental health needs often are overlooked in later life, as well as when we provide other needed services. Sadly, elder abuse and crime are no exceptions. The PROTECT program offers a unique opportunity for elder abuse and crime victims to receive mental health services, while they are receiving services as victims. This unique partnership between elder abuse/crime agencies and a mental health agency allows us to integrate mental health care into victim support services. But these types of integrated services are only available through partnerships between providers who care for victims and mental health providers. There must be a willingness to bridge service silos and take a more comprehensive approach to the needs of older adults. This strategy may be new to service providers who work with older adults, but it is the model of services offered to children. Sadly, older adults continue to lack the supportlegal and fiscalgiven to children. We hope that PROTECT becomes a model of the type of integrated services offered to older adult victims.Jo Anne Sirey, PhD, is a clinical psychologist and professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and directs the Weill Cornell ALACRITY Center.

Hunt, Teresa Moro, and Padraic StanleyApril 24, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingJustice & EquityAbstract:This article addresses the mental health care needs of three groups of older adults with layered marginalities: undocumented immigrants, those with serious mental illness, and those with intellectual disabilities. The needs and barriers related to mental health care provision for these groups are complex. Providing adequate support will require substantial changes at all care levels, including a need for legal access to care, adequate numbers of healthcare providers, additional training on aging for providers, and addressing stigma about including these groups and about mental health care needs. Addressing these needs will require resources and social and political will.Key Words:undocumented immigrants, intellectual disabilities, serious mental illnessDetermining the current mental health needs of older adults in the United States is challenging. Estimates from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services organization (SAMHSA)s National Survey on Drug Use and Health (SAMHSA, 2021) indicate that approximately 12% (6,500,000) of adults ages 65 and older experienced mental illness in the past year. However, February 2023 estimates of anxiety and depression alone are approximately 20% (1,156,000) in adults ages 65 and older (Panchal et al., 2023; United States Census Bureau, 2022a). Because these numbers do not include older adults with substance use issues or other mental health concerns, the magnitude of potential care needs is likely much greater.Adding to these concerns is the lack of U.S. mental health care providers. Currently, only 27.19% of the U.S. population lives in an area with enough mental health providers to meet care needs (Health Resources and Services Administration, 2023). For those unable to access mental health care providers, affording the care is a barrier for approximately 40% (7,821,000) of the population (SAMHSA, 2021), including the approximately 6 million adults older than age 65 who live below the poverty level (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022b).In addition to the lack of care providers and care affordability, there is pervasive stigma related to mental health concerns. The impact of this stigma reduces the likelihood that someone will seek mental health care (Golberstein et al., 2008; Moran, 2019; Thornicroft, 2008). Additionally, older adults may have a general lack of perceived need for mental health treatment and may internalize more stigma and negative attitudes toward mental health treatment than do younger cohorts (Lavingia et al., 2020).Treatment for mental health concerns is even more challenging for older adults belonging to groups that are routinely marginalized in the healthcare system and society at large, including undocumented immigrants, individuals experiencing serious mental illness, and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. As discussed below, these groups often experience layered marginalities that result in significant barriers to care, which are further complicated by current and historical mistreatment in our healthcare systems. Below, we explore overarching challenges and barriers for these populations and suggest potential improvements in care systems.Undocumented Older AdultsThe population of undocumented adults in the United States is aging. Due to increased border security and regulations, undocumented individuals who immigrated to the United States between the 1980s and mid-2000s to work were unable to engage in the decades-long practice of cyclical migration. Thus, many people ended up settling roots in the United Stateseventually building families, becoming valuable parts of communities and economies, and aging. According to a study by Ro et al. (2022), the U.S. undocumented Latinx population of older adults will grow nearly sevenfold by 2038. Meanwhile, statewide projections from Illinois predict the undocumented older adult population will increase more than eleven-fold (Stanley & Lange-Maia, 2020).Lack of Access, Resources, and Preparedness of Helping ProfessionalsMany undocumented older adults have lived for decades without access to health or mental health care, income security, benefits, or workers rights, and have been subjected to racism, discrimination, stress, harsh living situations, and fear of deportation (Garcini et al., 2021; Stanley & Lange-Maia, 2020). Undocumented older adults in most states do not have access to public options for healthcare and rarely are able to obtain jobs that provide healthcare benefits, leaving more than 40% without insurance (Ro et al., 2022). Accessing the limited health and mental health care services available to this population is too often extremely challenging or impossible. Additionally, because many undocumented older adults also cannot draw from Social Security and most do not have retirement plans, people are forced to work until they physically cannot anymore.In 2014 and 2017, Roots to Wellness Collaborative conducted studies that underscore these points. Roots to Wellness is a collaborative of health and mental health care providers, community organizations, and faith organizations on the Southwest Side of Chicago. This collaborative was convened by Enlace Chicago, a nonprofit organization working to confront systemic inequities and access barriers faced by residents in Little Village, the principal entry point for Mexican immigrants to the Midwest.Neither the systems serving older adults, nor those serving the undocumented population are prepared to work with undocumented older adults.In these studies, immigrants reported wanting mental health care and, further, did not have personal feelings of stigma about obtaining mental health care. However, they reported encountering structural and social determinants of health that were barriers, specifically affordability, access to childcare, transportation, language, availability, and long (or closed) wait-lists (Roots to Wellness, 2014, 2017). In short, the immigrant population wants mental health treatment; however, access and workforce barriers keep them from the services they need.Neither the systems serving older adults (healthcare, public health, and social services) nor those serving the undocumented population (federally qualified health centers, multipurpose social service organizations) are prepared to work with undocumented older adults. A study conducted by Stanley and Lange-Maia (2020) found that services used for mutual aid, support, socialization, and access to services did not include older adult offerings because the services older adults depend upon to live well, manage their health, and age in place are largely unavailable to those who are undocumented.This disconnect was mainly due to a lack of understanding of need when populations experience overlapping marginalities. For example, the free clinic serving the undocumented population did not have any providers prepared to work with older adultsand a donation bank that provided free durable medical equipment to older adults and others in need had no Spanish-speaking employees and required a Social Security number for their intake forms.Additional examples of overlapping marginalities causing significant disparities included a mental health agency that provides specialized therapy for older adults but only accepts Medicare, for which undocumented populations do not qualify; legal services for advance directives that only serve U.S. citizens; a lack of gerontology specialists in free health or mental health clinics; and social service care coordinators in free clinics that are unprepared to aid people with multiple chronic conditions, including connecting them to senior or home-based services.Advocates and professionals in the aging network are gaining awareness of the aging of the undocumented population, but there is a substantial need to advocate for structural solutions. These solutions must include immigration reform, expanding public healthcare systems to cover those who are undocumented, and cross-training workforces. We also must advocate for individuals, regardless of immigration status, to be able to access quality mental health care delivered by competent providers. Healthcare professionals, including mental health professionals, who are prepared to work with this population also should be prepared to face the grim realities of the disparities this population has endured.Older Adults with Serious Mental IllnessThe National Institute of Mental Health (2023) defines serious mental illness (SMI) as, A mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. SMI typically includes diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar illness, or major depressive disorderdiagnoses that often include symptoms that can cause significant functional impairment (SMI Advisor, n.d.). Note that other diagnoses may also be included in this definition depending upon the level of functional impairment. SMI can impact many areas of life and functioning, particularly for older adults.Older adults with serious mental illness have higher rates of lung and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.Although people in general are living longer due to advances in healthcare, older adults with SMI have shorter lifespans (1020 years) when compared to those without these disorders. Generally, they also have more chronic health conditions for their age and can be considered as older adults well before age 65 (Laursen, 2011; Lee et al., 2018). In the United States, the number of older adults with SMI is estimated to be around 2.5% of adults older than age 50, with diagnoses that range from approximately .2% (115,600) for the lower estimates of schizophrenia to 5% (2,891,100) in the estimates of major depression and/or bipolar illness (Mueser & Jeste, 2011; National Institute of Mental Health, 2023; SAMHSA, 2022).Needs and Related Barriers to Adequate CareOlder adults with SMI have care needs ranging from basic (food and shelter) to physical concerns (mental health symptoms, and social and physical functioning). Care and service provision for people with SMI, including older adults, is often provided by public institutions including Community Mental Health Centers, nursing homes, Veterans Health Administration Medical Centers, and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs).Although these agencies are expected to address the physical, mental, and social needs of this population, many are inadequately supported given their broad scope. Studies related to funding and care quality indicate lower quality of care for those with fewer individual-level resources (McGinty et al., 2015). People with SMI often struggle with individual-level resources including money, basic needs, and capabilities. This can also include limited personal capacities as well as the constraints and limited opportunities afforded them (Sylvestre et al., 2018).Older adults with SMI have higher documented rates of comorbid diseases including lung and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Many people also experience side effects, including obesity and tardive dyskinesia, from medications used to treat mental health symptoms (Lee et al., 2018; Newcomer, 2007). And people with SMI are at greater risk of developing dementia and of developing the condition at an earlier age (Richmond-Rakerd et al., 2022) than peers without SMI. Adequate mental and physical care for older adults with SMI requires care by an interdisciplinary team of highly skilled practitioners able to address the intersectionality of symptoms, social determinants of health, and the peculiarities of the fragmented U.S. healthcare system.Improvements in Mental Health CareThe often-layered marginalities described above exist on a backdrop of historical maltreatment and ongoing self- and societal stigma surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of SMI. To improve care for older adults with SMI, a broad systems-change approach is needed to: 1) address the historic mistreatment of people with SMI; 2) fundamentally change the way care is delivered across settings; 3) ensure that an adequate number of trained care providers are available to address stigma and poverty and their impact on mental and physical symptoms; and 4) support and empower families, informal caregivers, and the older adults with SMI.Significant, coordinated efforts also are needed at the system and individual levels. In many restricted settings (e.g., inpatient units) seclusion and physical and chemical restraints are used even though more person-centered, evidence-based options have been shown to be effective alternatives. Additionally, care provision must be a coordinated team effort given the complex needs of many older adults with SMI.Also, more specialized training for providers at all levels of care is needed because those providing care and assistance to older adults with SMI (e.g., mental health case managers, nursing assistants, home health aides, community health workers) generally are not adequately prepared to work with complex populations.Finally, enacting recovery-oriented care must include families, caregivers, and older adults with SMI in all levels of care provision, including policy decisions and formal processes. Inclusion must go beyond token representation and encompass a true partnership in structures and decisions. This approach empowers people with lived experiences and addresses the stigma undergirding barriers to care.Older Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD)Intellectual disability is one type of developmental disability (American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disability, 2023). People with IDD experience significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior that occurs before 22 years of age. Historically, people with IDD in the United States were locked away in large, poorly funded institutions which did not provide adequate mental or physical care (Moro & Brashler, 2019) and most people with IDD did not live into older adulthood. People with IDD now live long enough to acquire the same conditions related to aging as the general population (Hahn et al., 2015; Moro et al., 2017). Additionally, the population of older adults with IDD continues to growit is estimated that this population will double by 2030 (Hahn et al., 2015).Barriers to Mental HealthApproximately 40% of people with IDD have co-occurring mental health conditions (The Arc, 2019). Thus, people with IDD may seek mental health treatment for the same reasons as members of the general population. However, the mental health needs of older adults with IDD and how to best work with them is not well understood (Hahn et al., 2015). People with IDD confront common barriers when trying to obtain care, including difficulty communicating with providers, limited access to care, untrained providers, and poor pain and symptom management (Hahn et al., 2015; Moro et al., 2017; Moro & McGinley, 2021). Additionally, many adults with IDD experience sudden residential and care transitions later in life, which can increase stress, depression, and anxiety. Despite the need, the systems serving adults with IDD and the mental health and aging services are all unprepared for the increasing number of older adults with IDD.Mental health care for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities tends to be inconsistent and fragmented.Mental health care for people with IDD tends to be inconsistent and fragmented. According to The Arc (2019), there are five primary barriers to providing mental health to people with IDD: 1) misperceptions about the capability of people with IDD; 2) uncertainty about how to best communicate with people with IDD; 3) a lack of understanding about the needs of people with IDD and co-occurring mental health conditions; 4) a lack of knowledge about available entitlement programs and how service providers interact; and 5) a lack of collaboration across the disability, education, and mental health systems. Virtually all mental health professionals lack training in working with older adults with IDD (Hahn et al., 2015; Moro et al., 2017; Moro & Brashler, 2019).Suggestions for ImprovementsMental health providers need to educate themselves on how to best provide care to older adults with IDD, which may include training and resources from organizations including the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (NTG), The Alliance for Disability in Health Care Education (ADHCE), NADD, or local Arcs. The NTG advocates for services and supports for people with IDD impacted by Alzheimers disease and other dementias. ADHCE promotes the inclusion of disability-related theory, research, and clinical learning experiences in healthcare training. NADD is devoted to promoting knowledge, training, policy, and advocacy for people with a dual diagnosis of IDD and mental health conditions.Finally, The Arc is the oldest national disability rights group for people with IDD. It is important for mental health providers to also become advocates by encouraging educational programs to include disability content in their courses (Moro & Brashler, 2021).Another critical aspect to providing mental health care to older adults with IDD is to be aware of personal bias (Moro & Brashler, 2019). The United States is still deeply entrenched in the medical model of health in which health and illness reside in the individual, meaning that IDD is viewed as something wrong with the person. Too often, clinicians make erroneous assumptions about what people with IDD are capable of, which can lead to people not getting the mental health care they deserve.It is key for mental health providers to facilitate open communication, at an appropriate level, with older adults with IDD and to ask them if they would like a trusted support person (family, friends, or agency staff caregivers) with them, instead of making assumptions (Moro & Brashler, 2019; Moro & McGinley, 2021). Additionally, providers may not notice the subtle changes an older adult with IDD and dementia exhibits, or they may misattribute behavior changes to IDD, when, they are manifestations of pain or underlying illness (Hahn et al., 2015; Moro et al., 2017; Moro & Brashler, 2021).In SummaryOvercoming the challenges and barriers faced by various groups of older adults with layered marginalities requires advocating for change within systems of healthcare funding, regulation, training, policy, and provision. To generate the social and political will to make these changes, we must work to eliminate the stigma of belonging to marginalized groups, the stigma of needing mental health care, and the mistreatment that results.Marcia G.

VahiaApril 24, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingInnovation & Social ImpactAbstract:The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the integration of telemental health services for older adults. But such digitization also created new complexities regarding equitable access, privacy, and regulation. This article summarizes the evolving digital mental health landscape, focusing on regulatory frameworks, inherent risks, and the transformative potential of technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). Also covered are shifts in Medicare coverage and calls for standardized guidelines, interdisciplinary collaboration and robust regulation focused on patient privacy and AI ethics. Despite challenges, AI-driven diagnostic, monitoring, and intervention tools offer insights into mental health trajectories, using data generated by wearables, social media, and immersive technologies.KeyWords:telemental health, digitization, regulatory frameworks, AI, wearables, social media data, immersive technologyThe COVID-19 pandemic forced a rapid transition to telemental health services for older adults to meet rising demand. This was especially critical for rural providers due to distancing measures compounding existing access issues. While telemental health allowed for continuity of care, there were challenges. Older adults faced a learning curve to access these services, with many initially struggling with the technology needed for telehealth and requiring help from family or caregivers. Concerns existed about older adults with cognitive impairments or limited digital literacy, but proper instruction and support enabled many to use telehealth successfully. The rapid shift also led to concerns about ethical, legal, and clinical repercussions for older adults and the importance of addressing these barriers (Kuang, et al., 2021; Mazziotti & Rutigliano, 2021).The adoption of telemedicine also has spurred the integration of other technologies into the daily lives of older adults, partly aided by the increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools. In this article, we dissect the risks and benefits associated with the adoption of technology for older adults. Technology may spark new ways in which we conceptualize and treat mental illness and open the way to a more inclusive, accessible, and ultimately beneficial mental healthcare for older adults. This must be balanced against real risks of further fragmentation in care, more exclusive access for some and lesser access for others, and the potential compromise of fundamental privacy and data security (Vahia et al., 2022).In this article, written nearly 4 years after the COVID-19 pandemic, we consider the ways in which the digital mental health space for older adults is evolving. We first review the regulatory landscape for digital mental health and then consider the risks inherent with the use of various technologies. With these two aspects in context, we then review the potential of various technologies (primarily those that are based on AI) for diagnosis, monitoring, and intervention for older adults.The Regulatory LandscapeHistorically Medicare, state Medicaid programs, and private insurers have imposed limitations on coverage of telemedicine services (Jonk et al., 2020). The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a temporary relaxation of rules, allowing mental health professionals to provide services across state lines without additional licensure, and flexibility in HIPAA guidelines for telehealth privacy and security. Given the benefits documented during the pandemic, calls for standardized guidelines or laws regulating confidential information collection and AI in healthcare have grown, emphasizing patient privacy, safety, and ethical data use (Aggarwal et al., 2021; Jonk et al., 2020).AI may be involved in decisions related to end-of-life care or advanced directives for older adults, leading to complex ethical dilemmas.Following the end of the healthcare emergency in May 2023, some flexibility offered by telemedicine was lost, but prior to this, the December 2022 Omnibus bill extended key supports, including Medicaid and Medicare coverage for telehealth services. These changes now grant access to behavioral/mental telehealth services, allowing patients to receive care at home without geographic restrictions, including the use of audio-only communication platforms. There is less regulation around other technologies, including AI in healthcare. The Food and Drug Administration, American Medical Association (AMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) have proposed recommendations for ethical AI use, encompassing transparency, data privacy, safety, reliability, and accountability (Crigger et al., 2022). They also have proposed frameworks for regulation, including monitoring and validation of training data, transparency in algorithm development, and collaboration between stakeholders (WHO, 2023). However, these frameworks thus far are broad and do not specifically address mental health.Inherent Risks:As we review the integration of technology and AI in the mental healthcare of older adults, it is imperative to appreciate the inherent ethical, legal, and clinical risks. Below, we tabulate key considerations and potential challenges (Lieneck et al., 2020; Schriger et al., 2022; Tabibzadeh & Tran, 2022) that may emerge in that context.Ethical RisksPrivacy and confidentialityConcerns about the security of telehealth platforms and the risk of data breaches exposing sensitive patient information.Informed consentPatients may not fully understand the risks of telehealth, requiring clinicians to obtain thorough informed consent.Standard of careConcerns about delivering the same standard of care as in-person visits, especially for high-risk older adults or those with severe mental illness.Access issuesNot all older adults have access to the necessary technology or the digital literacy to use AI-driven mental health tools, thus exacerbating disparities in access to care.AgeismAI may inherit biases in the datasets it uses, and inadvertently discriminate against older adults, as algorithms may not account for the unique challenges in aging.End-of-life careAI may be involved in decisions related to end-of-life care or advanced directives for older adults, leading to complex ethical dilemmas.Legal RisksLiability and malpracticeIf an AI system provides harmful recommendations, it may lead to liability, potentially involving healthcare providers, developers, or healthcare institutions.Reimbursement and fundingLegal and regulatory issues surrounding reimbursement and funding for telehealth services can pose challenges.Licensing and jurisdictionLicensing requirements and jurisdictional issues across state lines or international borders.Patents and copyrightCreators of AI algorithms and software may need to address issues related to patents and copyright, especially if their AI systems have proprietary elements.Documentation and record-keepingProper documentation and record-keeping are essential in telehealth to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.Antitrust concernsIf a single AI provider or technology becomes dominant in AI-powered mental health for older adults, antitrust concerns may arise, potentially leading to legal action or regulatory intervention.Data overloadAI can collect large amounts of patient data, ultimately leading to enhanced monitoring and personalization of healthcare. However, this may create a dilemma for clinicians with the potential risks if actionable data are missed.Clinical RisksTherapeutic relationshipPotential impact on the content and process of therapy as a result of altered engagement, retention, attendance, and varying digital literacy.Crisis managementChallenges in evaluating and intervening with high-risk patients, including persons with suicidal thoughts.Algorithmic errorsAI systems can make mistakes in diagnosing mental health conditions or providing treatment recommendations.Lack of human expertiseAI may not fully replace the expertise and clinical judgment of human mental health professionals.OverspecializationAI tools may focus on specific conditions or aspects, while neglecting to consider a persons overall well-being and circumstances.WithdrawalReliance on AI may create dependance by patients and clinicians.A New Suite of Clinical Tools:The risks discussed above must be weighed against the range of tools that AI makes possible. These span diagnostics, monitoring, and intervention.Diagnostic Tools:An 81-year-old man with a persistent complaint of brain fog is evaluated by a psychiatrist after a medical and cognitive workup reveals no particular insight. The psychiatrist reviews the mans medications and decides to taper off medications that could be sedating and contributing to this complaint. In addition to data provided by the patient, the psychiatrist also asks the patient to use a wearable device to track changes in sleep and activity during this process. The wearable data reveal that the man spends most of his time in bed. These data help the psychiatrist change the treatment plan to include non-pharmacologic behavioral activation approaches and switching to an activating antidepressant, in addition to eliminating potentially sedating medications. Over the next 6 weeks, the patient improves notably.Increasingly, AI-based tools leverage diverse data sources, including electronic health records and behavioral data, to identify patterns and risk factors associated with mental health conditions in older adults. AI can discern subtle changes in behavior and symptoms and may be capable of predicting the onset of conditions like depression or dementia (Bartels et al., 2018). Moreover, AI can serve as a decision-support tool for healthcare providers, tailoring treatment plans based on individual needs by analyzing unique medical histories, genetics, and preferences (Ye & Liu, 2022). It also facilitates analysis of large existing datasets to identify trends that inform treatment strategies and healthcare policies.Typing speed on smartphones has been shown to help in quantifying mood and cognition.Numerous examples exist in research of how these data can aid diagnostics. Typing speed on smartphones has been shown to help in quantifying mood and cognition (visual attention, processing speed, and task-switching) in peoples natural environment to complement formal assessments. A rapidly growing body of literature is demonstrating how sensors, either in standalone devices (e.g., the Emerald device developed at MIT) or complex sensor arrays (e.g., the platform developed at the Oregon Center for Aging & Technology) can capture a broad range of biomarkers of behavior and aging, laying the groundwork for personalized medicine (Au-Yeung et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2021). The field of neuropsychology is leveraging data from web-based, open-access testing platforms (e.g.,www.testmybrain.org) to create norms that are more inclusive than the current standard of cognitive testing (Singh & Germine, 2021).An even more easily implementable tool is Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which uses daily surveys and questionnaires to collect real-time data on individuals thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and experiences in their natural environments. Using EMA can help individuals and their clinicians track the day-to-day variations in mental health and function. It has helped shed light on multiple aspects of mental health, including triggers for changes in behavior, patterns of stress response and response to interventions, and has applications in diagnostics and monitoring (Dao et al., 2021).Technology for Monitoring SymptomsThe integration of technology into mental health monitoring for older adults spans various devices and applications. Wearable devices, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, gather data on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns, with AI algorithms analyzing the information for signs of changes in mental well-being, such as decreased activity or sleep disruptions. Voice assistants and speech recognition systems contribute by analyzing speech patterns to detect emotional states, revealing conditions like anxiety, depression, or cognitive decline. Analysis of social media posts offers insights into users mental well-being based on language changes, post frequency, and shared content. Environmental sensors, including those in smart homes monitor factors like temperature, lighting, and movement patterns, correlating them with mental health changes (Chiu et al., 2020; Milnes-Ives et al., 2022; Pywell et al., 2020; Vijayan et al., 2021). Continuous monitoring at this degree of granularity can lead to important insights that facilitate personalized medicine.There are, however, legitimate concerns among stakeholders about these approaches potential privacy infringement. A distinction must be made between monitoring and surveillance. While both involve continuous tracking of behaviors using technology, monitoring in the clinical domain implies tracking in the service of clinical decision making. Monitoring must rely on safeguards including informed consent for using such technologies, giving control to those being monitored over when to turn off the sensors to protect privacy and autonomy, and ensuring that data are collected only for periods when they may directly guide care decisions. Also, it is imperative that data be stored securely and deleted upon request of the patient or after they have served the clinical indication for which they were intended.Technology in InterventionA 69-year-old woman seeks support from a therapist to help cope with the sudden loss of her best friend. The therapist recommends that the woman also use an app in between sessions to practice mindfulness, as an additional resource to augment her psychotherapy sessions. The woman is initially unconvinced, but after a couple of attempts, notices that her heart rate seems to slow down from over 90 beats per minute to about 75 beats per minute after she spends a few minutes practicing the mindfulness exercise in the app. This motivates her to use the app more regularly. After 12 sessions, she completes her therapy successfully, but continues to use the app on occasion when she feels stressed.Immersive Virtual Reality is finding a range of applications, including nature-based mindfulness-compassion programs and exposure therapies.Various technologies have found application in intervention delivery for older adults, particularly since the pandemic and scaling of telemedicine. Mobile applications coupled with wearables increasingly combine mood tracking, meditation, stress reduction, and personalized self-help tools catering to the unique needs and preferences of older adults. Supportive technologies enhance social support and facilitate participation in recreational activities (Simil et al., 2018). Online forums and communities reduce feelings of isolation by connecting older adults with peers. More recently, chatbots and virtual assistants have been shown to provide companionship, information, and therapeutic conversations. Robots like Paro offer emotional support and companionship, especially for those dealing with dementia and depression.Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is finding a range of applications, including nature-based mindfulness-compassion programs and exposure therapies (Skurla et al., 2022). Smartphones and tablet computers have been explored as cognitive and memory aids for older adults with and without cognitive impairment, and to promote general mental health. Reminiscence and Cognitive Therapy apps stimulate memory and cognitive function, proving beneficial for conditions like Alzheimers disease. AI-based cognitive training programs, tailored to the specific needs of older adults, hold potential for improving cognitive function and overall mental well-being (Wilson et al., 2022).A novel self-administered intervention called Lets Talk Tech for individuals with mild dementia and their caregivers, focuses on educating and facilitating communication about technologies used in dementia care. This intervention represents a new frontier by creating a loop where intervention delivery and quantification of cognitive/emotional function occur in lockstep (Berridge et al., 2023).Projecting the Future:The capacity for technologies to have a systemic impact on late life mental health will depend upon several factors. It will require substantial change in reimbursement policies to support the integration of technology. Outcome-based reimbursement models might present a viable solution. Expansion of covered services should include a diverse range of mental health professionals and modalities, catering to the unique needs of older individuals with mental and physical limitations. Cross-state licensure will enhance access to care via telemedicine, particularly in underserved areas. Continuous evaluation and iteration of ethics policies and applicable laws should occur in tandem with advancements in technology.This evolving landscape requires a paradigm shift in medical training, with the incorporation of technology increasingly emerging as a core competency. A new skillset will be called for that includes a working understanding of several elements of data science. As we stand at the cusp of a future where technology will be omnipresent in healthcare, perhaps the question to be asked is not whether technology is a friend or foe but are we equipping the workforce to understand these tools, optimize their potential, and minimize the risks and drawbacks.Sources of Support:An unrestricted gift from the Eric Warren Goldman Charitable Trust and the McLean Technology and Aging Lab.Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest:Dr. Vahia has performed scientific consultation for Otsuka.

Emery-Tiburcio, Susan Buehler, and Laura DonnanApril 24, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:There are not enough healthcare providers to meet the mental health needs of older adults, and older adults are far less likely to get mental health and substance use services than are younger adults. The SAMHSA-funded E4 Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health Disparities in Aging offers training opportunities to enhance knowledge, skills, and attitudes about aging, and increase implementation of evidence-based practice for older adults; provides tools and regional policy academies for building partnerships and sustaining an effective behavioral health practice so older adults dont fall through the cracks in our fractured health system; and provides resources for older adults and families.Key Words:mental health, behavioral health, disparities, E4 Center of ExcellenceAs the number of older adults grows in the United States, so, too, does the need for healthcare services of all kinds, including mental health services. While rates of mental health disorders are lower for older adults than for younger adults, the impact of mental health disorders is greater for older adults. Thus, effective mental health service provision for older adults is critical. As in other healthcare domains, we will never have enough geriatric mental health specialists to meet the current need (seeBuehler & Emery-Tiburcio, in this issue).This presents a timely opportunity to engage and equip generalists in the foundational competencies to work with older adults so that skilled mental health care is accessible to all of us as we age. Recognizing this disparity and similar disparities for other groups, SAMHSA in 2021 funded Centers of Excellence (CoE) for Behavioral Health Disparities, which are focused on three key populations: LGBTQ, African Americans, and Aging. The E4 Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health Disparities in Aging is part of an increasing inclusion of aging at SAMHSA, including a collaborative grant with CMS to create aCoE for Behavioral Health in Nursing Facilities, grants requiring lifespan perspectives, and a new role at SAMHSA focusing on aging and disability.E4 Center GoalsThe Engage, Empower, and Educate for Equity (E4) Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health Disparities in Aging was funded at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Our mission is, as the name indicates, to engage, empower, and educate healthcare providers and community-based organizations to encourage equity in behavioral health for older adults and their families across the United States. As shown in Figure 1, below, we are focused on the three key areas of depression and suicide, substance use disorders, and serious mental illness (SMI), and where they overlap to create or exacerbate physical health disorders.The E4 Center is focused on building knowledge, skills, and attitudes in the broadly defined mental health workforce.For some, these areas are layered on top of low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority status, which creates the most vulnerable population of older adults. To address these needs, the E4 Center is focused on building knowledge, skills, and attitudes in the broadly defined mental health workforce; working with health systems and the aging network to build partnerships to prevent older adults from falling through the cracks; providing training and technical assistance in evidence-based programs for older adult mental health and substance use; and, although we dont train older adults and families directly at the E4 Center, providing resources to share that can equip the mental health workforce across the country.Knowledge, Skills, and AttitudesTo enhance knowledge, skills, and attitudes about aging, we offer several virtual and in-person training opportunities.OurLearning Community, targeted at healthcare clinicians and students, offers monthly 90-minute webinars with free continuing education credits on topics covering how to meet the mental health and substance use needs of older adults.To address the need for basic competency among clinicians, we developed aFoundational Competencies in Older Adult Mental Health certificate program. This is a 16-hour online program with content areas consistent with older adult mental health competencies for psychology, social work, and psychiatry. This certificate program was developed for licensed clinicians with a minimum of a masters degree. The content is freely available to any interested learner, however, and can be used to augment university curriculum. Continuing education credits are available for a small fee, and group discounts are available.In addition to the online program, we host a three-dayin-person Foundational Competencies in Older Adult Mental Health programat Rush University. Each spring we invite 25 to 30 licensed clinicians from across the country to Chicago to participate in didactic lectures, discussion, interactive exercises, and simulated patient experiences. Travel stipends and free continuing education credits are offered.The E4 Center developed the4Ms Behavioral Healthframework, which augments the original4Ms of an Age-Friendly Health System(What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility) to clarify the role of behavioral health providers in meeting the needs of older adults. This framework was pilot-tested in 2023 in three community mental health clinics and in 2024, will roll out more broadly. The E4 Center developed and launchedsix educational modules for 988 and crisis call centerworkers to increase knowledge in older adult behavioral health. Topics covered include ageism, depression and anxiety, suicide risk, cognition, substance use, and common life issues. Continuing education credits are available for psychologists and social workers.Active Listening trainingwas created and is delivered in partnership with the Health & Medicine Policy Research Group. This training is appropriate for direct care workers and anyone who wants to learn to listen effectively and respond empathically.Safe-HOME naloxone awareness trainingwas created and is delivered by our partners at the University of Chicago College of Pharmacy. This virtual training about opioid safety and naloxone awareness is appropriate for any healthcare or direct services worker in the community.Evidence-Based ProgramsReframing Aging: Addressing ageism is a critical factor in older adult healthcare. Thus, the E4 Center partnered with theNational Center to Reframe Agingto offer asix-part webinar series on Reframing Aging,as well as Reframing Aging facilitator training to E4 Center staff and partners. We also collaborated in creating theQuick Start GuideStarting with WHY?to provide guidance on language about aging.Evidence-based interventions for older adult mental health and substance use have been highlighted in webinar series each year at the E4 Center, including CBT basics, CBT beyond basics, CBT for insomnia, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychosocial interventions for older adults with SMI. Recordings of these training webinars are available in ourwebinar archive. Upcoming series include peer supporters working with older adults and older adult family systems.Building PartnershipsGeriatrics is a team sport, so partnerships across healthcare, community-based organizations, and state entities are critical to build care quality. To facilitate these partnerships, the E4 Center has developed two toolkits and state and regional policy academies.Toolkits: In addition to the written documents described below, we offer webinars describing the highlights of each toolkit, available in ourwebinar archive. We are happy to offer technical assistance to any organization wishing to implement any or all of the recommendations described in these toolkits.oUtilizing Cross-sector Partnerships to Reduce Behavioral Health Disparities in Older Adultsreviews the landscape of potential partners in older adult behavioral healthcare, options for building and maintaining partnerships, the policy issues that can act as barriers and facilitators for this work, plus concrete examples of how partnerships can work well.oBuilding and Sustaining Effective Behavioral Healthcare for Older Adults: Strategies and Considerationsis a comprehensive review of critical issues in engaging older adults in behavioral healthcare, creating an environment of care, and facilitating effective financial plans to assure service sustainability.Policy Academies were developed and led by E4 Center Scientific Directors Drs. Steve Bartels and Fred Blow to bring together critical entities across states to identify and begin to solve problems older adults face regarding mental health and substance use. Thus far, the E4 Center has engaged four states and one region. Each policy academy has engaged state leaders, including mental health, substance use, aging, housing, transportation, Medicaid, universities, and others in a brief series of virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person sessions to identify each states unique challenges, clarify the issues at stake, and create a specific 1-year plan to begin to address one key issue. The E4 Center has provided technical assistance to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation. To create a policy academy in your state, or get involved in ongoing efforts, please contact the E4 Center ate4center@rush.edu.Older Adult and Family ResourcesThe E4 Center also provides key resources for older adults and families.OurSpeak Up to Reduce Stigmacampaign was designed to give voice to older adults who have experienced mental health or substance use treatment via video, and decrease the stigma that is so prevalent in the current cohort of older adults.OurCommunity Resourcespage provides resources on a wide variety of topics related to older adult mental health and substance use.Who We AreThe E4 Center is co-directed by Erin Emery-Tiburcio, PhD, ABPP, and Robyn Golden, LCSW, at Rush University Medical Center.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpring 2024Post-Traumatic Growth and AgingBy Julia Weinman and Lisa M. BrownApril 24, 2024TagsHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureAbstract:Most older adults have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime. This article explores the relationship between aging and post-traumatic growth (PTG). Increasingly, PTG is recognized as a phenomenon describing positive changes following an adverse or traumatic event. This article reviews a widely researched model of PTG in the context of aging and provides evidenced-based factors associated with PTG in older adulthood. Given the dynamic nature of PTG, it is never too late to experience positive psychological growth. While PTG holds promise, a nuanced approach is essential, respecting individual variations and growth trajectories.Key Words:post-traumatic growth, older adults, aging, traumaBy late life, nearly 90% of older adults will have suffered at least one traumatic event (Kuwert et al., 2013). The World Mental Health Consortium reports that a substantial number of people worldwide (30.5%) will endure four or more traumatic events during their lifetime (Benjet et al., 2015). Of these trauma-exposed individuals, a small but significant percentage (5.6%) will go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Koenen et al., 2017).However, approximately 50% will go on to eventually experience some type of post-traumatic growth (PTG; Wu et al., 2019). This finding highlights the complex relationship between trauma symptoms and PTG. To better understand the process of PTG among older adults, it is useful to consider the interaction between trauma and aging.Although a traumatic event can be a taxing stressor at any age, the intersection of aging and mental health in the context of a trauma event presents a particularly complex and pressing concern. As people advance through the life course, exposure to more small and large traumatic events becomes increasingly likely (Kuwert et al., 2013). The psychological consequences of these events can be long-lasting. Moreover, the presence of acute and chronic conditions that are more common in late life can amplify the effects of trauma. Physical and cognitive changes intersect with the psychological impact of trauma and foster additional challenges for older adults who are striving to maintain well-being (Lupien et al., 2009).Additionally, the aging process can produce thoughts and emotions associated with past traumatic events that can lead to a resurgence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms (Davison et al., 2006). The probability of a resurgence of symptoms is increased during major life transitions, such as changes in health status, familial roles, retirement, or the death of a loved one.Perceptions and coping styles in response to a traumatic stressor also are influenced by cultural background, beliefs, and values. What might be considered traumatic in one culture may not be equally important in another. Cultural competency is essential when working with older adults from diverse backgrounds in any setting. Social factors also play a significant role in shaping the well-being of older adults who have sustained trauma. The loss of or decrement to a social support network resulting from death, retirement, or relocation can leave an older adult isolated and more vulnerable to traumas harmful effects (Davison et al., 2006). Social isolation also can exacerbate a range of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, which are common diagnoses for people with histories of trauma (Brandt et al., 2022).When examining the effects of trauma on mental health, it is also essential to consider cultural and historical context. Many older adults have undergone traumatic stressors related to war, displacement, and discrimination. Additionally, chronic stressors, such as minority stress, have been shown to adversely affect mental health (Brandt et al., 2022). Collective trauma from pandemics and extreme weather events also can have lasting negative effects on functioning (Silver et al., 2020). However, those who have experienced significant distress following an adverse or traumatic event, as previously mentioned, may experience PTG (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). PTG is a psychological occurrence observed when positive changes result after a traumatic stressor or challenging event (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004).Defining and Differentiating Post-Traumatic GrowthResilience and PTG are not the same concept. Resilience has been defined as the ability to maintain a stable equilibrium when facing adversity (Bonnano, 2004). Resilience also differs from recovery, a normal process in which functioning is temporarily impacted but slowly returns to baseline within a reasonable timeframe. It is essential to note that resilience does not imply the absence of pain, suffering, or distress. Resilient individuals often feel transient distress, but these events are typically short-lived and do not interfere with long-term functioning (Bonanno, 2004). This transient nature of distress, rather than its complete absence, differentiates resilience from other recovery trajectories. While resilience is another positive outcome following an adverse or traumatic event, it describes returning to baseline functioning rather than experiencing positive changes and growth.Individuals may perceive an enhanced sense of self, which allows them to better cope with future stressors.Fundamentally, PTG is about positive change and is aligned with earlier research concerning the nature of positive outcomes following adversity (Linley & Joseph, 2004). Often, discomfort and stress stimulate growth. This idea can be seen across disciplines and in a wide range of contexts. In fields such as education, medicine, business, and others, the idea that challenges can foster growth is well-documented and has profound implications in education, technology (Henriksen et al., 2021), and medicine (Edmondson, 2004).It is posited that as individuals navigate the aftermath of traumatic events, they often undergo a process of cognitive restructuring wherein they reevaluate their core beliefs, values, and priorities (Elam & Taku, 2022). A person who has survived a life-threatening illness may develop a heightened appreciation for the importance of family and friends. This cognitive shift can lead to an increased sense of purpose, greater emphasis on personal growth, and appreciation of life. Moreover, individuals may perceive an enhanced sense of self, which allows them to better cope with future stressors (Mann et al., 2004).Tedeschi and Calhouns 1996 and 2004 models of PTG are widely accepted and researched. During the past 3 decades, their publications have been referenced more than 6,000 times. In their 1996 model, Tedeschi and Calhoun identified five distinct domains in which growth occurs:Relating to othersNew possibilitiesPersonal strengthSpiritual changeAppreciation of lifeIn the 2004 publication, Tedeschi and Calhoun elaborated on their conceptual framework and provided empirical evidence for their PTG model.The first domain, relating to others, involves positive changes in interpersonal relationships (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). Trauma can foster a sense of interconnectedness with others and lead to more meaningful and supportive social connections (Calhoun et al., 2022). Individuals often report a deepened sense of empathy and compassion for others, leading to more meaningful and authentic connections and a strengthening of their social support networks. As individuals grapple with traumatic experiences, they have an opportunity to undergo powerful transformations that enhance their overall sense of well-being and contribute to a more meaningful and fulfilling life. Improvements in relationships and social support systems have implications for overall well-being and positively impact mental health.New possibilities, the second domain, refers to how individuals experiencing PTG may perceive an expanded range of potential opportunities (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). Traumatic events can prompt individuals to reevaluate their goals, values, and priorities, leading to a greater openness to novel experiences and a willingness to explore uncharted territories (Muldoon et al., 2019). This domain underscores the idea that growth can emerge from reimagining ones future in the wake of adversity.The third domain, personal strength, involves the development of an improved sense of resilience and capabilities in the face of adversity (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). Individuals who develop personal strength as a part of PTG often report a greater sense of self-efficacy, improved coping skills, and increased self-confidence. This domain reflects the idea that trauma can catalyze personal growth, enabling individuals to recognize their inner strength.Spiritual change, the fourth domain of PTG, pertains to shifts in an individual's beliefs, values, and spiritual or existential mindset (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). Trauma can lead to reevaluating ones sense of purpose and meaning in life, often resulting in a deeper connection with spiritual or existential beliefs (Peres et al., 2007). The significance of existential growth and the search for meaning in the aftermath of adversity is emphasized in this domain.The fifth and final domain, appreciation of life, emphasizes an enhanced sense of gratitude and a deeper appreciation for various aspects of life that were previously unseen or unacknowledged (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). One explanation for this is that individuals who have suffered a traumatic event may develop a greater awareness of the fragility of life, leading to a more profound appreciation for the small things in life. This domain highlights the transformative power of trauma by supporting a sense of gratitude and mindfulness.Due to PTGs dynamic nature, it is vital to engage in strategies that support the development and maintenance of these positive changes.These five domains provided by Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) afford a comprehensive and detailed framework for understanding the potentially transformative nature of trauma by highlighting the potential for positive psychological changes in its aftermath.There is a wide range of reports regarding the timeline for the manifestation of PTG following an adverse or traumatic event. Research shows that PTG is not confined to a specific timeline, as it can emerge anytime from two weeks to many decades after a traumatic event (Fogle et al., 2020; Frazier et al., 2001; Park et al., 2005). This variability in the onset of PTG highlights its dynamic nature and emphasizes the importance of considering individual differences in the processing of trauma. It is critical to note that it is never too late to experience PTG. Regardless of the timing of the adverse or traumatic event, positive psychological change is always a possibility.Interestingly, studies have suggested that PTG can fluctuate over time. However, research findings are mixed. One study found that PTG tended to decrease with age (Bachem et al., 2018), while another reported that PTG increased (Frazier et al., 2001). These contradictory findings emphasize the need for further research to understand the nuanced temporal patterns of PTG in different populations.But given the dynamic nature of PTG, it is vital to engage in strategies to help support the development and maintenance of these positive changes. Research has shown that PTG in older adults is associated with adaptive coping strategies to help protect against the impact of new stressors (Park et al., 2005). PTG has been associated with improved attitudes toward existential concerns and mortality among older adults.Facilitating Post-Traumatic GrowthUnderstanding the factors facilitating PTG in older adults is essential for designing effective interventions and support systems. Several factors have been identified that promote PTG in this population. The first factors are social support, connectedness, and community. Recent research has consistently emphasized the pivotal role of strong social support in facilitating PTG (Calhoun et al., 2022). These social relationships serve as a protective buffer against the negative psychological effects of trauma, offering a secure space for emotional expression and sharing.Through open communication and empathetic interactions with friends, family members, partners, or support groups, older adults can process their thoughts and emotions with the support of others. Moreover, social support can provide opportunities to gain perspective and reduce feelings of isolation. Finally, feeling integrated in communities can foster a sense of belonging and purpose (Calhoun et al., 2022). Older adults who remain socially engaged are more likely to perceive their lives as meaningful and interconnected with the broader community.A clear and meaningful purpose serves as a guiding framework that helps people make sense of traumatic events and find meaning through adversity. The pleasure of pursuing hobbies, engaging in volunteer work, or actively contributing to their families and communities can renew life meaning. This sense of direction is a psychological anchor during difficult times, providing a continuous and stable sense of self. Additionally, investing in developing a renewed sense of purpose can help protect against the psychological effects of future adversities (Park et al., 2005).Spirituality and religiosity also have emerged as influential factors in promoting PTG among older adults (Malone & Dadswell, 2018). Facets of an individuals belief system can provide comfort and hope in the aftermath of adversity or trauma. Spirituality and religiosity often involve a search for deeper meaning and purpose, which aligns closely with the domains of PTG (Russano et al., 2017). For many people, their beliefs offer a lens through which they can interpret life events. In times of crisis, spirituality and religiosity can enable older adults to find strength and resilience, whatever their beliefs. Moreover, religious practices often encourage forgiveness, acceptance, and compassion, which are valuable components of the growth process.Alternatively, believing in yourself, otherwise known as self-efficacy, plays a pivotal role in the context of PTG among older adults. Self-efficacy refers to an individuals confidence in their ability to manage and control their environment (Bandura et al., 1999). In the aftermath of trauma, self-efficacy beliefs can empower individuals to actively engage with their experiences and take meaningful steps toward positive psychological growth. Individuals with a strong sense of self-efficacy are more likely to perceive themselves as capable of overcoming challenges and embody a sense of mastery (Bandura et al., 1999).This belief in their competence may fuel their motivation to seek resources and support while applying adaptive coping strategies essential for PTG. Importantly, research with older adults has shown that self-efficacy and a sense of purpose or meaning in life are strongly associated with PTG (Greenblatt-Kimron et al., 2022). A strong sense of purpose is thought to enhance self-efficacy because the person has a clear direction. In turn, self-efficacy can empower individuals to actively pursue their purpose, leading to a mutually reinforcing cycle of growth and personal development.Challenges with the PTG ConceptHowever, it is essential to critically consider whether promoting PTG inadvertently places pressure on trauma survivors to grow. While the concept of PTG is undoubtedly appealing, it is not without its share of controversy. Some argue that promoting PTG may inadvertently pressure survivors to experience positive changes in the aftermath of trauma (Jayawickreme et al., 2020). Survivors who feel compelled to demonstrate signs of growth may feel inadequate or guilty if they fail to meet expectations. This pressure to grow post-trauma may undermine the authenticity of the healing process, potentially causing more psychological distress.Additionally, the idea that trauma survivors should strive to realize positive changes in their lives as a result of their experiences may be controversial. It may inadvertently downplay the validity of their negative emotions and the challenges they encounter, minimizing the significance of their suffering. There are risks inherent in establishing PTG as a goal to be achieved because of the potential to overlook the complex and diverse responses individuals have to trauma stressors.The idea that trauma survivors should strive to realize positive changes in their lives as a result of their experiences may be controversial.Furthermore, the complex relationship between PTSD and PTG illustrates the difficult journey many trauma survivors must endure to process the devastating impact of a traumatic event. Many people experience PTG simultaneously with PTSD symptoms (Cadell et al., 2003; Lev-Wiesel & Amir, 2003).A study examining PTG in veterans found a U-shaped inverted relationship between PTG and PTSD. That is, veterans who screened positive for PTSD reported more PTG than veterans who did not screen positive for PTSD (Tsai et al., 2014). Two meta-analyses revealed a significant relationship between the two, where the highest levels of PTG occurred at intermediate levels of post-traumatic stress (Peters et al., 2021).It is advantageous to carefully consider how the concept of PTG is promoted to older adults after a traumatic event. Older adults have a lifetime of experiences that typically include traumatic events and losses. The pressure to find growth in late life may be compounded by unresolved past traumas, making it crucial to approach PTG with sensitivity. Each persons path to PTG is unique. To foster a supportive environment for navigating the complexities of their past experiences while seeking post-traumatic growth, it is important to recognize that older adults have different cultural backgrounds, lived experiences, coping strategies, and needs. This calls for a more nuanced approach that respects individual differences and acknowledges the potential for delayed or fluctuating growth trajectories in older trauma survivors.The intricate interplay between aging, trauma, and PTG presents a multifaceted landscape that requires further research and treatment development. The prevalence of adverse or traumatic events across the lifespan underscores the importance of understanding the dynamics of PTG, particularly among older adults. A growing body of literature suggests that PTG is not limited to a specific timeline and can emerge at various points in ones life, emphasizing the dynamic nature of this phenomenon. Research can inform and refine clinical practices used with older adults who are seeking to attain positive psychological changes at any point in their lives, regardless of the timing of their adverse or traumatic event. The psychological consequences of trauma can be enduring. The physical and cognitive changes experienced by older adults as they age underscore the complexity of treating trauma-related issues in this subgroup of the population. The resurgence of trauma-related symptoms occurring during major life transitions in older adulthood emphasizes the need for tailored support and interventions.Social factors, including the loss of social support networks, loneliness, and isolation, significantly impact the mental health outcomes of older adults who have endured trauma (Calhoun et al., 2022). Importantly, recognizing the role of culture and historical context in shaping the experiences of older adults is crucial, particularly considering the collective and repeated traumas many have endured. These factors influence coping styles, access to resources, and attitudes toward the use of mental health services. By fostering PTG and embracing the factors contributing to its development and maintenance, it may be possible to mitigate some of the negative effects of trauma, leading to an increased sense of well-being for many older adults.Julia Weinman, MS, MA, is a doctoral candidate at Palo Alto University in Palo Alto, CA.

Creative arts engagement is an attractive programmatic intervention, enabled by selective modulation of brain activity, and reinforced by personalized and coordinated psychological and social features. Tested arts-based programs to address loneliness are available through Project UnLonely, an initiative of The Foundation For Art & Healing and deliverable by CBOs, offering scalable access to diverse older populations. Digital technologies (AI and VR), can tailor programs to individual needs and preferences, enhancing reach and impact. Arts-based programs, increasingly supported by digital technologies, show great promise in reducing loneliness.Key Words:loneliness, creative arts, awe, older adult health, digital health, Project UnLonely, Foundation For Art & HealingLoneliness among older adults in the United States is a pervasive and pressing issue that warrants attention and intervention. As the aging population continues to grow, the prevalence of loneliness in this demographic has reached alarming levels. According to a report published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2020), approximately one third of adults ages 65 and older report feeling lonely, with a significant portion experiencing chronic loneliness.This problem is exacerbated by factors that frequently accompany aging, such as the loss of spouses or friends, retirement, or caregiving. Additionally, older people have higher rates of physical limitations that restrict social interactions. Both reduced mobility and hearing loss have been found to correlate with higher risks of loneliness (Moeyersons et al., 2022; Shukla et al., 2020). Older adults from marginalized communities, such as immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, and incarcerated people, are particularly vulnerable to loneliness (Division of Population Health, 2023).The consequences of chronic loneliness among older adults are profound, affecting physical and mental health. Detrimental impacts on mental health include increased risks of depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. The isolating nature of loneliness can lead to a sense of purposelessness and despair, exacerbating existing mental health conditions. Additionally, loneliness has been linked to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and suicidal ideation among older adults, highlighting the urgency of addressing this issue (Perissinotto et al., 2012; Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2015). Its no wonder that researchers have found that the mortality risk of loneliness is double that of diabetes and can be equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day (Office of the U.S. Surgeon General, 2023). The loneliness epidemic will only grow, given that by 2050 one in four Americans will be older than age 65.Options for most lonely older people are limited. Older adults with increasing physical and mental health needs and fewer social touchpoints are more likely to need either a part-time or full-time caregiver, who often becomes a primary source of social interaction. The caregiver role is often filled by unpaid family caregivers and/or low-paid caregivers who experience high rates of burnout, limiting their ability to be socially engaged, further isolating the care recipient.Many older people turn to assisted living facilities to find community. But the price of these facilities has skyrocketed in response to an increase in demand. The median annual price of assisted living has climbed 31% faster than inflation (Rau, 2023). Additionally, most older people want to age in place. AARP found that 77% of adults ages 50 and older want to remain in their homes for the long term (Davis, 2022). This percentage has been consistent for more than a decade.Fortunately, the growing awareness of loneliness and its burden on older adults has prompted increased exploration of new ways to address these challenges, one of the more innovative approaches being the use of creative expression with programmatically linked mindfulness and social learning components (Nobel, 2023). In addition, use of digital technologies to increase reach, participant engagement, and impact of arts-based programming offers significant advantages in terms of reduced cost, increased access to traditionally underserved population subsets, and outcomes (Nobel, 2023). This article will offer a brief introduction to and exploration of both.Creative Arts as a Health-Enhancing Intervention for Older AdultsRecognizing the multifaceted nature of loneliness, innovative approaches are necessary to address the mental health needs of older adults. Creative arts, encompassing activities such as visual arts, music, dance, expressive writing and theater, have emerged as effective tools to engage and uplift older adults, reducing the risk of depression, anxiety, addiction, and suicide. Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive impact of creative arts on the mental well-being of older individuals (Galassi et al., 2022).Beyond the modulation of stress-related hormones, creative arts also can induce a cascade of neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and reward.Engaging in creative arts allows older adults to express themselves, often fostering a sense of purpose and accomplishment. Whether through painting, playing a musical instrument, or participating in dance classes, these activities provide avenues for socialization and emotional expression, combating the social isolation that often accompanies aging (Cohen et al., 2006; Noice et al., 2013). Creative arts interventions have been shown to enhance cognitive function, improve mood, and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety among older adults (Guzmn-Garca et al., 2016).In the pursuit of effective interventions, the transformative role of creative artsencompassing music, painting, photography, poetry, and danceemerges as a powerful tool in mitigating social challenges. There has been a surge of interest recently in scientific foundations behind the assertion that creative arts can significantly reduce loneliness and isolation in older adults, focusing on three key mechanisms: the neurobiological impact, the facilitation of meaningful connections through storytelling, and the ability to induce awe and wonder (Nobel, 2023).Neurobiological Impact of Creative ArtsThe neurobiological underpinnings of how creative arts influence our well-being are increasingly well-documented (Magsamen & Ross, 2023). One notable aspect is the modulation of neurotransmitters and hormones associated with stress and pleasure. Scientific studies have consistently shown that engagement with creative arts can lead to a reduction in cortisol, the stress hormone, and an increase in serotonin, dopamine, endorphins, and oxytocinthe feel-good neurotransmitters that contribute to mood regulation and social bonding.Studies have found that listening to music has a direct impact on cortisol levels, effectively reducing stress. One study measured salivary cortisol levels before and after exposure to relaxing music, highlighting the potential of music as a stress-reducing intervention (Khalfa et al., 2003). Additionally, the positive effects on neurotransmitters provide a neurochemical foundation for the subjective experiences of joy and connection that individuals often report during and after engaging in creative activities. Also, the study identified that the soothing effect of music on cortisol levels persisted even after the stressor had subsided, indicating a lasting impact on stress reduction.Beyond the modulation of stress-related hormones, creative arts also can induce a cascade of neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin, associated with pleasure and reward. Studies using neuroimaging techniques have demonstrated that listening to music leads to the release of dopamine in the brains reward centers (Salimpoor et al., 2011). This neurochemical response to music provides a biological basis for the positive emotions and enhanced mood reported by individuals engaged in musical activities, further highlighting the potential of creative arts in alleviating loneliness.The role of endorphins, the bodys natural painkillers, is another facet of the neurobiological impact of creative arts. Endorphins are released during activities that induce pleasure and positive emotions, acting as natural mood enhancers. A study by Tarr et al. (2015) explored the release of endorphins in response to physical activities, including dance. The findings suggest that engaging in dance as a form of creative expression, can trigger endorphin release, contributing to an overall sense of well-being and potentially reducing feelings of loneliness.Oxytocin, often referred to as the love or bonding hormone, is yet another neurotransmitter associated with social connection. The release of oxytocin is heightened during positive social interactions and emotional bonding. Of note, it has been shown that creative arts activities increase oxytocin levels (Tanaka et al., 2020). A study by Ditzen et al. (2009) demonstrated that intranasal administration of oxytocin led to increased positive communication and decreased cortisol levels during interpersonal conflicts. While this study focused on romantic relationships, it highlights the potential of oxytocin in enhancing social interactions, a mechanism that can be extrapolated to the social bonds facilitated by creative arts.The Arts as a Catalyst for Health-Enhancing StorytellingIn addition to the neurobiological impact, creative arts offer an avenue for individuals to share personal narratives, fostering a sense of connection and understanding. Artistic expression allows older adults to communicate their experiences, emotions, and memories in a non-threatening and enriching manner. A study by Cohen et al. (2006) found that engaging in creative activities, such as writing or visual arts, was associated with better health outcomes and decreased loneliness in older adults. The act of storytelling through various art forms serves as a bridge, enabling individuals to convey their unique life stories, thereby fostering empathy and mutual understanding among peers.Moreover, the sharing of personal stories is a reciprocal process. As one opens up through artistic expression, this invites others to reciprocate, creating a shared space for vulnerability and genuine connection. This reciprocal storytelling has been identified as a key factor in building social bonds and reducing feelings of isolation (Haslam et al., 2018). The narrative format of creative arts not only serves as a mode of self-expression but also as an instrument for weaving a tapestry of shared human experiences.Creative Arts, Awe, and Reduced LonelinessAwe is a positive feeling that arises when engaging with scenarios and circumstances that include a sense of vastness, linked to things not fully understood. Studies have shown that awe and wonder induced by programmed activities can contribute significantly to increased socially connecting behaviors among older adults (Sturm et al., 2022). Experiencing art, whether through visual masterpieces, melodic compositions, or rhythmic movements, has been linked to an expanded sense of self and connection to a larger universe of human experience. Awe-inspiring moments elicit a sense of interconnectedness and humility, diminishing feelings of loneliness by placing individuals within a broader context.Community outreach campaigns are crucial for overcoming stigma around mental health issues and encouraging elders to participate in creative arts programs.Research suggests that exposure to awe-inducing stimuli leads to increased prosocial behavior, emphasizing the potential of creative arts to enhance social connections (Rudd et al., 2012). Whether it be the grandeur of a symphony, the intricacies of a painting, or the poetry of movement, creative arts have the capacity to evoke emotions that transcend the self, fostering a sense of shared wonder that can be a powerful antidote to loneliness.Creative Arts: Accessible, Enjoyable, UniversalThe accessibility of creative arts across diverse cultural backgrounds further enhances their potential as tools for social connection in older adults. Music, painting, sculpture, photography, poetry, and dance have universal appeal, transcending linguistic and cultural barriers. Engaging in these activities allows individuals to connect through shared experiences and expressions that are inherently human, facilitating a sense of unity within diversity.Moreover, the playful and engaging nature of creative arts makes them enjoyable activities to share with others. Participatory art forms, such as group dancing or communal singing, create spaces for collective expression, reinforcing a sense of community among older adults. The enjoyment derived from these activities adds a layer of positivity to social interactions, contributing to sustained engagement and, consequently, reduced loneliness.In summary, the therapeutic potential of creative arts in mitigating loneliness and isolation among older adults is rooted in the convergence of neurobiology, storytelling, and the elicitation of awe and wonder. The impact of creative arts on neurotransmitters, coupled with the ability to share personal narratives and induce a sense of wonder, collectively offer an opportunity to achieve a profound reduction in feelings of loneliness. Furthermore, the accessibility and playful nature of these art forms make them versatile tools for fostering connections across diverse cultural backgrounds. As we delve into the rich tapestry of creative expression, we discover not only the profound impact it has on individuals but also its transformative potential to build vibrant and interconnected communities among older adults.Implementing Creative Arts Programs in Community SettingsWhile the benefits of creative arts for older adults are evident, delivering these programs in community settings poses challenges. Barriers to implementation include limited funding, a lack of trained personnel, and logistical issues such as transportation for participants. Overcoming these obstacles requires a coordinated effort from community organizations, healthcare providers, and policymakers.To enhance accessibility, community centers, senior living facilities, faith-based groups, and other community-based organizations (CBOs) can collaborate to establish and fund creative arts programs for older adults. Securing financial support from governmental agencies and private foundations can facilitate the expansion of these initiatives. Additionally, training healthcare professionals, teachers, social workers, and others with interpersonal engagement skills to lead creative arts sessions ensures the quality and effectiveness of the programs while expanding the workforce required to deliver them.Community outreach and awareness campaigns are crucial for overcoming stigma surrounding mental health issues and encouraging older adults to participate in creative arts programs. By fostering a supportive and inclusive environment, communities can break down social barriers that contribute to loneliness among older adults.Project UnLonely: Partnering with CBOsCBOs often are limited in their ability to deliver impactful programming due to a lack of resources, including the staff time and funding to develop, deliver, assess, and scale programs. Through its signature initiative, Project UnLonely, from the Foundation for Art & Healing (FAH), is attempting to address these challenges by making available to CBOs a suite of tested, effective programming for older adults. These programs are designed to be accessible, sustainable, and adaptable to diverse audiences while helping participants build resilience, adopt pro-health attitudes and behaviors, develop meaningful social connections, and feel less lonely.FAH provides delivery partners with a complete toolkit of delivery resources on a digital platform, including a complete curriculum with slides, facilitator guide, customizable promotional materials and handouts, and evaluation tools to assess impact and return on investment (ROI). The costs for partners are a modest investment of staff time, along with some simple, inexpensive art supplies. The programs can be delivered virtually or in-person.AI, through personalized recommendations and adaptive learning, can tailor creative arts programs to the preferences and needs of each older adult participant.Program facilitators do not need any clinical expertise or specific professional credentials. FAH provides extensive training and support to them to ensure ease of use and comfort with program delivery, which ensures ease of implementation for partners.Each program is built around a framework that includes three components: creative expression, mindfulness, and social-emotional learning. All components have a strong base of scientific evidence behind their effectiveness in supporting mental and physical health.Project UnLonely program participants engage in simple mindfulness exercises for warm-up and centering before doing creative work. Those efforts use art supplies to make drawings, collages, and other creative artifacts; allow participants to engage in journaling and expressive writing exercises; and create spaces to enjoy the experience of individual and group coordinated creative movement. After the art-making experience, participants share thoughts and feelings through a variety of social learning exercises.Here are three examples from the Aging UnLonely program portfolio:1. Aging Outside the LinesAging Outside the Lines is an 8-week program for older adults designed to reduce loneliness, build resilience, and encourage prosocial and pro-health behaviors.Program participants have reported increases in their confidence in managing aging, ability to manage emotions, quality of life, perceived meaning in life, and feelings of resilience.2. More Money in Your PocketMore Money in Your Pocket is a 4-week program designed to help low-income adults older than age 50 reframe their relationship with financial insecurity, leading to improvement in financial self-care attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors.Pilot tests showed increases in participants feeling less stress around money, more awareness of their emotions related to money, more awareness of benefits that can improve their financial health (such as SNAP), and more confidence in managing money.3. Family Caregiver ProgramsCaregivers Colors & Connection is a program developed to address the emotional and practical challenges of family caregivers of people with new onset Alzheimers.Participants report the program helped them feel more connected to other caregivers, better able to identify ways to engage in self-care, more in touch with their emotions, and more familiar with available resources and support.CBOs are essential components of a person-centered approach to the effective deployment of a variety of programs to address social determinants of health like social isolation and loneliness (Nguyen et al., 2021). Due to an often trusted relationship with their constituency, CBOs have a particularly important role to play in addressing loneliness because its a deeply personal experience, often accompanied by guilt and shame. In emerging payment models for healthcare entities that emphasize patient engagement as part of a population health model, there is growing funding for the delivery of community health programs, a trend that is likely to continue (Horwitz et al., 2020).Digital Technologies as Catalysts for Arts and Connection InnovationThe COVID-19 pandemic pushed people to recognize the importance of technology as a tool for connection in the modern worldespecially for socially isolated older adults. In an era of rapid technological advancement, digital technologies offer promising solutions to enhance the personalization, engagement, impact, and scalability of creative arts programs targeting loneliness in older adults. The integration of the Internet, virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI) can revolutionize how these programs are delivered and experienced.The Internet serves as a powerful tool for connecting older adults with creative arts resources, allowing them to participate in virtual classes, access instructional materials, and engage with a broader community of like-minded individuals. Online communication platforms have the capacity to free up community program administrators time, so they can shift their focus to program development.In the future, emerging technologies have the potential to enhance the lives of older people in new ways. We have already seen an uptick of companies promoting robotic animal companions for older adults (Koh et al., 2021). However, rather than replace the need for human connection, these technologies can enhance it through creative programming. Virtual reality, with its immersive capabilities, provides an innovative platform for experiencing art and music in a way that transcends physical limitations.AI, through personalized recommendations and adaptive learning, can tailor creative arts programs to the unique preferences and needs of each older adult participant. While there have been limited studies on the ability of VR to promote well-being in persons with dementia, there is a dearth of research on its broader application for older adults (Appel et al., 2021). More studies are urgently needed to further understand the exciting potential of both VR and AI in addressing the older adult loneliness epidemic.Lastly, digital technologies also enable remote participation, addressing issues of mobility and transportation that often hinder older adults from accessing community-based programs. Virtual creative arts programs can be designed to accommodate various levels of physical ability, ensuring inclusivity and participation from the comfort of ones home. Moreover, AI-driven analytics can track participant progress and assess the impact of creative arts interventions on mental health outcomes, allowing for continuous improvement and customization.Combating loneliness among older adults in the United States requires a multifaceted approach that incorporates creative arts interventions and harnesses the potential of digital technologies. By addressing the root causes of loneliness, fostering community engagement, and leveraging innovative solutions, society can enhance the well-being of older adults and pave the way for a more connected and fulfilling aging experience.Acknowledgements:With grateful acknowledgment and thanks to Ruthie Gottesman, first-year Master of Public Policy candidate at the Harvard Kennedy School for her contributions to the section on digital supportive technologies and to Jennifer Martin, director of programing at The Foundation For Art & Healing (FAH), for her contributions detailing currently available FAH arts-based programs.Jeremy Nobel, MD, MPH, is a primary-care physician, public health practitioner, and award-winning poet with faculty appointments in the departments of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard T.H.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpring 2024The Cultivation of Psychological Resilience as an Older Adults SuperpowerBy Tobi Abramson and Pamela Braverman SchmidtApril 24, 2024TagsHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureAbstract:Psychological resilience is vital to the well-being of older adults. A resilience framework acknowledges that challenges exist but emphasizes strengths. Resilience, a multidimensional construct, is influenced by the interaction of internal factors and external resources. Older adults are capable of sustained resilience. To regain ones sense of self when faced with adversity requires building on personal strengths and using psychotherapeutic strategies. This article focuses on the dimensions and underlying factors of psychological resilience in older adults, and tools that can be used when working therapeutically to cultivate resiliency as a catalyst for positive change.Key Words:psychological resilience, mental healthAt the heart of resilience is a belief in oneselfyet also a belief in something larger than oneself. Resilient people do not let adversity define them. They find resilience by moving towards a goal beyond themselves, transcending pain, and grief by perceiving bad times as a temporary state of affairs. Experts argue among themselves about how much of resilience is genetic. People seem to differ in their inborn ability to handle lifes stresses. But resilience can also be cultivated. Its possible to strengthen your inner self and your belief in yourself, to define yourself as capable and competent. It's possible to fortify your psyche. It's possible to develop a sense of mastery (Estroff Marano, 2003, para. 24).Resilience is a complex, constantly evolving, dynamic, and multidimensional construct, which has broad implications for ones capacity to adapt. The American Psychological Association (APA; 2022) defines resilience as The process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life experiences, especially through mental, emotional, and behavioral flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands (para 1).In Zautra et al.s (2010) definition of resilience, the focus is on resilience as an outcome and an adaptation when confronted with adversity. What these and other definitions of resilience have in common is that resilience helps restore balance while simultaneously serving as a protective factor and an inner strength when one experiences adversity.Resilience is not a single skill, but rather a variety of skills and coping mechanisms. Resilience comes in many formspsychological (the focus of this article), social, and physical. Psychological resilience is linked to psychological recovery from stressful, adverse, or traumatic life events (these terms will be used interchangeably throughout this article).Laird et al. (2019) highlights the importance of a framework for understanding the construct of resilience. Theoretical perspectives conceptualize resilience in one of three ways:Resilience is considered an attribute or trait, a stable resource upon which people can draw (Abramson & Braverman Schmidt, 2018). Each individual possesses this trait to varying degrees and these differences often predict how quickly one recovers from stressful situations.Resilience also is considered to be a state or a dynamic process, whereby the adverse event or stressor provides an opportunity for the older adult to re-evaluate and consequently have the chance to change their behavior.The third framework focuses on resilience as an adaptation to stress, trauma, or other adversities that one might encounter. Each perspective provides a context for clinical interventions based on reaction, capacity, and severity.Psychobiological Components Impacting ResilienceWhen adversity is characterized as a hardship it can induce stress, but also it can be a catalyst to creating resilience (Fletcher & Sarkar, 2013). Psychological resilience is influenced by the interaction of both internal factors (i.e., personality, genetics) and external resources (i.e., social circumstances, environment; Linkov & Galaitsi, 2021). It is the interrelationship between genetic, neurobiological, cognitive, and developmental factors that influence ones ability to cope and thrive in the face of adverse circumstances. Significant psychobiological factors that impact the potential for resilience include genetic factors attributed to resilience-related traits (such as emotional regulation, stress response, and the capacity to handle challenges). There is increasing evidence that genetics, dysregulated immune systems, insulin resistance, and changes in metabolism contribute to resiliency (Merchant et al., 2022).Experiencing a traumatic event affects the brain circuity associated with focusing, flexibility, and emotional regulation. When one experiences continual trauma, feelings of danger and helplessness cause the body to secrete stress hormones, which negatively impact the bodys immune system and organ functioning (van der Kolk, 2014).Genetics, dysregulated immune systems, insulin resistance and changes in metabolism can contribute to resiliency.Neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin influence mood and regulation of the stress response. Other brain regionsthe medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampusare involved with resilience (Miyagi et al., 2020). A major function of the prefrontal cortex (considered to be the administrator in charge of resilience) is response flexibility (Siegel, 2007). The process of coping with life stressors increases prefrontal myelination and expands a region of cortex that broadly controls arousal regulation and resilience. Psychological resilience may have neuroprotective properties (Laird et al., 2019), wherein the brain rewires itself to heal and to restorethus enhancing resilience.Early childhood experiences (nurturance, attachment, and relationships) combined with environmental conditions significantly impact an individuals psychobiological capacity for resilience. The impact of early experiences with hardships and the social environment arising from the intersectionality of systemic racism, poverty, or adverse childhood experiences may further impact a persons health and ability to bounce back as they age.Generational or intergenerational trauma also has the capacity to affect older adults physical health by activating the stress response and decreasing the capacity to cope under pressure. These traumas can result in increased inflammation, cardiovascular problems, and compromised immune function. Existing health conditions also may worsen or become more challenging to manage. All of these psychobiological factors play a significant role in resilience, influencing the capacity to effectively respond to lifes stressors.Psychosocial Components and Personality Characteristics Impacting ResilienceThe combination of having a strong psychosocial adaptive system combined with an individuals biological stress-regulation, immune system, problem-solving skills, and personality characteristics can be protective and can be activated when facing a traumatic event (Masten, 2021). Previous experience with trauma or adverse events causes significant psychosocial challenges and highlights the older adults coping skills or lack thereof. Severity of the trauma, accumulated life experiences, and age-related vulnerabilities are additional psychosocial components impacting resilience. Also, internalized attitudes about aging, negative stereotypes, and ageism negatively impact an older adults resilience.Conversely, specific psychosocial factors have an ameliorative effect and have significant potential in influencing an older adults ability to thrive in the face of adversity. Social support, including strong connections with family, friends, and community can enhance resilience. Being visible, having a sense of belonging and validation from others helps to navigate stressful situations when they arise. These increased social connections, and leaning on ones social networks, have been found to decrease depression and anxiety.Simultaneously, these perceived connections increase the belief that friends and/or family will provide support when needed. Self-efficacy, a social-psychological construct, contributes to resilience as it provides one with the confidence to handle difficult situations. Belief systems that support ones ability to handle stress, manage ones emotions effectively, overcome challenges, and achieve desired goals are integrated into ones narrative of being able to adapt to ones circumstances (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2004).By using a growth mindset, resilient individuals approach challenges, seek solutions, and take the time to assess circumstances when overcoming obstacles. Resilient individuals often look for strategies that help them improve and resolve the present situation (Vahidi, 2021). Cognitive factors such as cognitive flexibility and adaptive coping strategies impact individual thinking and belief systems, and influence the level of resilience in confronting challenges. Other social factors such as access to education, spiritual support, and financial stability increase resilience. Although exposure to trauma and adversity can be harmful, these challenges also can foster personal growth and wisdom because of the belief that good can result from experience. Highly resilient older adults exhibit both a faster physical and emotional recovery from stressors, supporting the importance of cultivating resilience when working with older adults.Personality style and temperament are two protective factors that shape and modify the experiences of psychological and environmental stressors and adversity. Resilient individuals seem to possess qualities such as grit (perseverance and determination) and adaptability (Laird et al., 2019). Having an internal locus of control (sense of mastery) is another personality characteristic linked to how well an older adult adapts to adversities, the ways in which the individual views and engages with the world, their social supports and resources, and their past and present coping strategies (APA, 2022).It appears that some people innately possess better responses to adversity and distress. The APA (2020) describes characteristics displayed by resilient individuals that include: 1) having strong relationships and social support networks, 2) being flexible with a willingness to adapt, 3) maintaining a positive outlook and optimism, 4) emotional self-regulation, 5) engaging in mindfulness and spirituality, 6) having strong problem-solving skills, 7) understanding and embracing ones strengths, 8) demonstrating emotional awareness, and 9) finding a sense of meaning. These characteristics are at the basis of a strengths-based approach.Cultivating Resilience in Clinical PracticeResilience is an important pillar for optimal aging. As one works with clients it is important to keep in mind that resilience is a dynamic, constantly evolving trait. Resilience is learnable, trainable, and teachable as capacities for resilience are innate in the human brain. Psychological research on resilience indicates that the skills and resources linked to greater positive adaptation can be practiced by older adults. Cultivating resilience is at the heart of the therapeutic process.Internalized attitudes about aging, negative stereotypes, and ageism negatively impact an older adults resilience.As a clinician it is important to hold faith in the clients potential to build resilience and share with the client that adversity provides an opportunity for learning more resilient behaviors. Mental health professionals can lead clients in learning new skills to help them cope more skillfully with the inevitable ups and downs of life in ways that are efficient and effective. Whatever the presenting issuesillness or injury, loss, or infidelitytrauma or whatever the presenting symptomsanxiety, depression, shame, despairclients come to psychotherapy for guidance and support in recovering and discovering their strengths, their competencies, and improving their well-being.The process of cultivating resilience in older adult clients is highly individualized and may vary for each person, so the clinician will need to work with each individual to determine what is most important in building and restoring their balance. The first step in building resiliency with older clients begins with helping clients to avoid seeing crises as insurmountable problems (APA, 2022) and building on their existing strengths. Mental health professionals can build on an individuals grit and promotive and protective factors.Tools and Techniques to Supercharge ResilienceSupercharging resilience begins with a resilience-oriented treatment approach. Linkov and Galaitsis (2021) matrix incorporates four domainsphysical, informational, cognitive, and socialthat guide the clinician in assessing how the individual functioned in each domain both before and during the adverse event. This serves as a guide to coach clients in the adaptation process by focusing on existing internal strengths (Linkov & Galaitsi, 2021).To ameliorate the impact of adversity, it is important to help the client identify appropriate support and resources, consider their life experiences, generational, and intergenerational influences, as well as current developmental changes. Culture and psychosocial factors such as loss of loved ones, retirement, or new living environments may have to be processed and integrated into the therapeutic process on the clients road to building resilience. The therapist must be sensitive to any physical and medical limitations so the clients can do the work in the therapeutic session.Empowering individuals with age-based, culturally and gender appropriate mental health services, trauma-informed interventions, and social support networks can help reduce the severity of trauma and increase the potential to recover. The more important recovery is to the person, the more likely they will remember the skills learned in the recovery process.There are numerous tools and techniques that can be used with clients to cultivate resilience.A strengths-based approachis predicated on the belief that each individual has the capacity to empower themselves with unique goals, inner strengths, and external resources. This approach uses techniques and strategies focused on channeling an individuals existing inner strengths and resources to overcome adversity, emphasizing personal assets, skills, and positive qualities. By highlighting what individuals can do well and leveraging their existing skills and abilities, older adults will be better equipped to bounce back from challenges and setbacks.Cognitive behavioral practicesthat support the cultivation of resilience such as Life Integration Therapy, based on the belief that there is an innate ability of the mind-body to heal itself, has various protocols including a life review timeline, integrating past traumas and unresolved issues that can be reframed, thereby creating choices of how to proceed in the present.Using the tenets of positive psychology, mental health professionals are encouraged to work with clients from the perspective that cognitive behavioral change is significant to enhance wellness. By deconstructing anxiety, thought patterns can improve the way one feels, thereby enhancing self-esteem and interrelationships with others. The cultivation of resilience can be viewed as a superpower in mental health. It helps develop grit through difficult times, increases self-confidence, helps rebound from adversity, and diffuses stress to enable personal flourishing. These are powerful benefits.Mind-Body Practices, such as Tai Chi and yoga, address the common disconnection from the body to help the older adult become more present. Mind-body interventions increasingly are used to promote stress reduction and are associated with a range of positive outcomes including improved cognitive function and resilience. Benefits include pain and tension reduction, relaxation, healing, and improved coping skills, often in the face of shame or blame. Tai Chi and yoga are defined by slow, intentional movements as moving meditations that increase emotional regulation. Van der Kolk (2014) posits that body connection activities, such as yoga, Tai Chi, and breathwork, improve interoceptive awareness to effect positive psychological changes.Mindfulnessis defined as a moment-to-moment awareness of ones experience. Mindfulness practice improves concentration and reduces negative rumination by retraining the individual to be aware of the present moment without judgment, causing the brains neurocircuitry to rewire. There are many practices that cultivate mindfulness such as Qigong, meditation, and yoga, and all of these practices involve training awareness on the present to increase capacities of clarity and calm.According to the National Institutes of Health (2021), mindfulness practices may help people manage stress, cope better with serious illness, and reduce anxiety and depression. Evidence suggests that mindfulness can lower blood pressure, improve sleep, and cope with pain. Many people who practice mindfulness report an increased ability to relax, a greater enthusiasm for life, and improved self-esteem, and the ability to decrease rumination. Practicing mindfulness builds resilience by helping the older adult more skillfully bring compassion to themselves.Within the practice of mindfulness is a specific meditative technique of Loving Kindness meditation. This practice of being aware of the present moment, expressing self-gratitude and kindness, and sending oneself intentional good wishes creates benevolence and wellness. It enhances positive emotions and empathy toward oneself, mitigating feelings of sadness. Ben-Shahar (2007) describes Loving-Kindness Meditation as effective for self-reproving individuals in reducing this behavior and depressive symptoms, as well as improving self-compassion and positive emotions. Cultivating resilience is at the heart of the therapeutic process.Visualization and Affirmationare tools used in mental rehearsal that increase positivity. Visualization is a technique using mental imagery that can reprogram the nervous system to improve well-being. Body scan visualization is defined by focusing attention to parts of the body and bodily sensations in a gradual sequence from feet to head to reconnect with the physical self without judgment, leading to improved wellness. Affirmations are a form of self-talk that changes thought patterns and influences positive behavioral changes.Resilience as amindset. Mental health professionals guide older adults to interpret and respond to situations in a more positive way. Clients are redirected to see challenges as opportunities for personal growth through assessing their responses to stress and visualizing positive ways of responding.Reframing the narrativeas a therapeutic practice helps the older adult view a situation from another perspective, changing the narrative and increasing awareness of unhelpful thinking patterns. Reframing externalizes the problem to let one look at the situation in a more objective manner, thus allowing for a reinterpretation of the negative situation by adopting a positive perspective: I am willing to change the way I look at a situation. This allows someone to view adversity as a temporary situation and see that crises are surmountable: I can get through this.Increasing self-awareness. Teaching clients to accurately perceive what is happening, helping them bring self-awareness to where stress is being held in the body, supporting self-acceptance, and self-compassion to their reactions helps them gain perspective and view adverse change as an opportunity.Becoming a moreflexible thinkerrequires an effort to stop generalizing by using words such as always, never, and nothing ever works out. The goal is to pinpoint what needs to be done and empower the client to approach the problem in a more dynamic manner. This helps the older adult deal with uncertainty, solve problems, and incorporate new approaches.Practicing gratitudeis another super-charged, power-boost tool. Gratitude is associated with increased happiness and induces more positive emotions, savoring good experiences, positively impacting health, decreasing the stress response, and aiding social connection.Self-compassion. Applying Buddhist philosophy, self-compassion has three main components: a) self-kindness versus self-judgment, b) a sense of common humanity versus isolation, and c) mindfulness versus overidentification (Neff, 2011). Self-compassion allows one to engage in self-care and self-love, which are necessary when facing difficult life events (Neff, 2011). These components combine and mutually interact to create a self-compassionate frame of mind, resulting in decreasing negative rumination, fear of failure, and increasing the potential for self-forgiveness. On a related note, savoring the good increases appreciation and positive emotions.Enhancingself-efficacyreflects confidence in ones motivation to leverage control over circumstances and can inspire solutions about stressful events.Optimism. By experiencing appreciation in life, optimism is increased because a more positive outlook brings comfort to the present time. The client learns how to optimize their strengths rather than negative self-perceptions. By highlighting what individuals can do well and leveraging their existing skills and abilities, older adults are better equipped to bounce back from challenges and setbacks.Purpose and Meaninginvolves serving a purpose greater than oneself to help in the discovery of ones own value and worth.ConclusionSweet are the uses of adversity which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in his head (William Shakespeare, 1623/2006).Resilience is a dynamic trait that can be developed. People who are resilient allow themselves to be changed and transformed by the experience of adversity, learning to focus on their strengths. With therapeutic support, older adults can develop and strengthen their coping skills, emotional regulation, and reactivity. The ability to prepare for and adapt to uncertainty and emotional emergencies is a key factor in resiliency. Cultivating resilience can significantly contribute to an older adults ability to navigate stressors and adversity that arise.Tobi A.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpring 2024A Note of IntroductionBy Tobi AbramsonApril 24, 2024TagsHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureDear Readers,It has been my privilege to guest edit this issue ofGenerations JournalonMental Health, Aging, and Resilience.When asked why this topic matters, one need only think about the growth of the aging population and the anticipated increase in the number of older adults who will need, utilize, and benefit from mental health services. Older adults are resilient and can continue to grow and thrive. They have so much to offer, so much to teach us, and there is so much we can learn from them. Weas professionals who have chosen to work in this fieldhave the responsibility to support older adults as they live their best and fullest lives.As a psychologist who has spent much of my career focusing on the mental health of older adults, I am always reminded that mental health lies at the core of living a full and rich life. Especially as one ages. Yet, the literature focuses largely on psychopathology and available interventions to treat these psychopathologies. While such articles are crucial for those working in the mental health field, we also need to shift our way of thinking and embrace a strengths-based perspective that reflects resiliency and growth. As mental health professionals, we have the opportunity to build our mental health toolkit to include strategies that foster and cultivate resiliency as our clients engage in mental health services.This issue ofGenerations Journaldoes just that. It shifts the narrative and encourages you, the reader, to consider the strengths and resilience of older adults and the innovative tools and approaches that can build our mental health practice.Each author was asked to frame their articles with resiliency in mind. What follows is a brief snapshot of these articles. The journal opens withmy articlewithPamela Braverman Schmidt, The Cultivation of Psychological Resilience as an Older Adults Superpower, which frames the dimensions and underlying factors of psychological resilience and the tools that can be used when working therapeutically to cultivate resiliency as a catalyst for positive change. Resiliency really is an older adults superpower.Jeremy Nobelsarticle, Alleviating Loneliness in Older Adults Through Creative Expression,reminds us about the meaningful reconnection, the healing process and transformative role of engaging in creative endeavors to enhance well-being, reduce loneliness, and foster a sense of purpose and accomplishmentall components of resiliency.Positive transformation can occur following a traumatic experience as described byJulie WeinmanandLisa M. Brownin their article, Post-Traumatic Growth and Aging.These authors shift how we generally think about trauma even further as they focus on positive change and growth as an outcome of adversity.Resiliency really is an older adults superpower.'Mental health help is often underutilized by older adults due to myriad barriers, including mental health literacy.Kim Williams and Lisa Fursts article, Mental Health Literacy among Older Adults: What Do We Know, and What Can We Do?highlights the importance of addressing literacy and developing literacy plans.Tracey Gendronspiece, The Impact of Ageism on Elders Mental Health,addresses the pervasive impact ageism can have on an older adults mental health and the importance of addressing this prejudice in creating a more inclusive and mentally healthy society built upon strengths and not stereotypes.A growing body of evidence supports the feasibility and effectiveness of task sharing in the mental health field.Patrick RaueandKianna Seresinhesarticle, Mental Health Task Sharing: Training Volunteers, Peers, and Interns,addresses this via their innovative model, Do More, Feel Better.Older adults who have been a victim of abuse or crime often struggle with acting on safety strategies.Jo Anne Sirey, Isabel Rollandi, andClare Culversarticle, Connecting Crime and Abuse Victims to Mental Health Services,is practice-based, and covers the importance and value of connecting crime and abuse victims to mental health services.The mental health needs of three groups of older adults with layered marginalitiesundocumented immigrants, those with serious mental illness, and those with intellectual disabilities, are complex and the focus ofMarcia G. Hunt, Teresa Moro,andPadraic Stanleysarticle, Unmet Mental Health Care Needs: Layered Marginalities in Older Adult Populations.The COVID pandemic opened the door and expedited the need for mental health services to be provided virtually and telephonically, spurring a new era of digital mental health, including the use of AI. This has created complexities around access, privacy, and regulation. The question still to be answeredDigital Mental Health for Older Adults: Foe or Friend?is well-covered inSaeed HashemandIpsit V. Vahiasarticle.Building the Geriatric Mental Health and Substance Use Workforce,bySusan BuehlerandErin E. Emery-Tiburcioreminds us about the need to strengthen the geriatric healthcare workforce to meet the mental health and substance use needs of a growing older adult population, and how it is imperative that the field focuses on innovative and multi-level solutions.A previousGenerations Journalarticle from 1997 byBonnie Genevay, See Me! Hear Me!Know Who I Am! remains relevant today. From a professional and personal perspective, Bonnie, a gerontologist and beloved member of ASA and of the former Mental Health and Aging Network (MHAN), reminds us of how important it is to value the whole person and not just the process of \"assessment and diagnosis.\"Program SpotsThis issue ofGenerations Journalalso highlights two programs doing cutting edge work in the mental health arena. One modelThe E4 Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health Disparities in Aging,byErin E. Emery-Toburcio, Susan Buehler, andLaura Donnanfocuses on the 4 Es:Engage, Empower,Educate forEquityto educate providers and community-based organizations on how to provide more equitable behavioral health care for older adults.The second program spot highlights the Ibasho modelled by eight core principles, it empowers older adults to co-create community that builds social capital. This program can be found in the program spot, The Ibasho Model of Elder Empowerment and Community Ownership,byEmi Kiyota, Christy Nishita, Yasuhiro Tanaka, Erin Ah Sue,andHelen Turner.It is up to each of us to continue innovating and focusing on older adults resilience and strengths, in order to best meet the mental health needs of our aging population. I hope you take some time to enjoy this issue in its entirety and continue to cultivate resiliency.Sincerely,Tobi Abramson, PhDPsychologistPhoto credit: Shutterstock/chalermphon_tiamYou may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpring 2024Our Guest Editor: Passionate About Elders ResilienceBy Alison BiggarApril 24, 2024TagsHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureTobi Abramson may serve in two rather large day jobsdirecting both geriatric mental health initiatives for New York City and the Mental Health Counseling Program at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)but we at ASA know Tobi as a deeply involved leader who is passionate about older adults mental health.She also served as a member of the ASA Board of Directors for several terms, chaired ASAs Awards Committee, MHANs Leadership Council and Editorial Board, co-chaired ASAs NYC regional group and served on its Governance and Strategic Planning Committees.Outside of ASA she is a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine and the Gerontological Society of America and has served as board chair of numerous state and national aging-focused organizations. She worked at NYIT as a full-time member of the faculty and continues to work as an adjunct professor.Perhaps her most fervent belief, though, is the worth of looking at mental health from the vantage point of growth instead of decline. For years she pushed hard for thisGenerations Journalissue on older adult mental health and resilience to become a reality, and we thank her for that persistence.Since 1991, Abramson has in some capacity worked to foster elders mental health, considering such work to be a gift. I never stop learning from them or about myself, she said.As a psychologist, I often feel that if I can help an older adult build or find their resilience by integrating all of the aspects of their lives into a meaningful whole, I have given them the best gift. Each older adult has so many strengths that can become buriedsometimes due to lifes stressors or environmental or health events. It is so important for mental health professionals to focus on an older adults strengths and the growth that is still possible, she added.When asked about career milestones, Abramson remained in character, talking about the people with whom she works instead of the work itself. Accomplishments range from seeing an older adult in their ah-ha moment in a therapy session, to seeing students who had no interest in working with older adults, surrounded by their own ageist views, become excited about working with this population, she said.Describing how one NYIT health science student was at first completely disinterested in working with older adults, but as part of an interprofessional, experiential course on environmental home modification that paired health science and interior design students, he was required to use a storytelling approach to find out what was meaningful to the older adults involved. As this student worked with the couple on a potential home modification plan, he came away from the exercise in awe of how busy and engaged with life the couple was.About a year later, the student came back to tell me he entered a graduate program with a specialty in aging, as this is where he wanted to spend his career, Abramson said. She had developed and co-taught the course with the NYITs Chair of Interior Design, knowing the storytelling approach would necessitate close interactions over time. And it worked.Abramson is well aware of the power of narrative and has used that awareness often in her volunteer work for ASA, especially in her years spent on the Generations Editorial Advisory Board.Her motivations for editing this particular issue are deeply tied to her day-to-day work. I have always believed that we all have strengths, whether or not we can see them through the cloudy skies that sometimes plague us, she said.Older adults are much more resilient than we may presume and have the potential to grow throughout life. There are so many wonderful examples of this if we just would take the time to really look for them. You never stop learning, growing, and thriving, and it is important for mental health professionals to focus greater attention on resiliency and how to cultivate it when someone loses their ability to see whats possible, Abramson added.She hopes readers will be inspired to look for these strengths in the elders with whom they work and to build resiliency in themselves, too. Abramson also would like us all to focus on the many innovations in the ever-changing world of mental health (this is where her work at NYIT comes in), to add new tools to existing toolkits.Abramson envisioned and edited this issue, which is packed with 15 articles, covering fascinating topics from post-traumatic growth to alleviating loneliness through creative expression to building a stronger geriatric mental health workforce.

Emery-TiburcioApril 24, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:The United States must act now to strengthen the geriatric healthcare workforce to meet the mental health and substance use (MH/SU) needs of a growing older adult population. Older adults have complex MH/SU needs. The geriatric specialist shortage means we need innovative and multileveled solutions. This article describes national efforts that have been implemented to address this shortage and offers recommendations key to preparing the geriatric MH/SU workforce. These strategies include increasing geriatric specialists through unique pathways, building knowledge of older adult MH/SU in generalists, promoting diversity in providers, engaging non-licensed providers, and reforming Medicare/Medicaid billing structures.Key Words:mental health, substance use, geriatric, older adult, workforceDemographic shifts in the United States toward a growing older adult population create challenges in our healthcare system and workforce. We are underprepared to meet the healthcare needs of older adults and the imbalance in this supply and demand for older adult services is projected to swell. This is especially true for mental health and substance use (MH/SU) services. This shortage creates important opportunities for us to prepare and strengthen the MH/SU workforce in an effort to adequately address the complex needs of older adults.Older adults and mental health/substance use (MH/SU)Although rates of mental health disorders and substance use decrease with age, older adults who experience these issues generally endure a greater functional impact. For example, depression is linked to increased morbidity; reduced physical, cognitive, and social functioning; and increased mortality in older adults (Maier et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2019). In older adults, even subclinical levels of depression can impact functional impairment (Wei et al., 2019). Older adults also experience complex interactions between mental health, medical conditions, and functional impairment. Older adults with mental illness are more likely to develop medical comorbidities and die 5 to 20 years sooner than those without mental illness (Olfson et al., 2015).Substance use is increasing with the Baby Boomer generation (Mason et al., 2022; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2021), particularly alcohol use in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Eastman et al., 2021; Leventhal et al., 2022). In 2019, approximately 10,292 opioid overdose deaths were in people ages 55 and older (Mason et al., 2022). Older adults with chronic medical conditions, pain, and disability also are at risk for prescription drug misuse and even prescribed drugs like opioids and benzodiazepines can cause cognitive side effects and increase fall risk. Given age-related changes in metabolism, any amount of alcohol or drugs may affect older adults adversely.Among older adults with substance use disorder, only 28% receive treatment.Older adults also have a higher risk for suicide (SAMHSA, 2021). Older adults who attempt suicide are much more likely to die from attempts at self-harm compared to younger adults (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2023); in fact, older White men have the highest risk of completed suicide compared to all other age groups (Luoma et al., 2002). Data show that most older adults who completed suicide had seen a primary care provider in the previous month, but many primary care providers miss opportunities to screen older patients for mental health needs (Luoma et al., 2002).Behavioral health disparities in older adultsOlder adults are 40% less likely than younger adults to pursue or engage in mental health treatment. When they do seek treatment, older adults are less likely to receive adequate services and often are treated by providers with little training in geriatrics (Wang et al., 2000). This disparity also is true for substance use disorders (SUDs; Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2012; Sorrell, 2016; Wang et al., 2000).Among older adults with SUDs, only 28% receive treatment (Huang et al., 2013). While older adults are twice as likely to engage in integrated primary care models for at-risk drinking than referral services (Bartels, 2003), these programs are rarely available. Several factors contribute to this disparity in older adult MH/SU treatment, including mental health stigma, ageism, lack of trained professionals, and limited financial incentives, transportation, and Medicare payment structure for mental health services.National Efforts to Build and Strengthen a Geriatric MH/SU Workforce2012 IOMCommission: Committee on the Mental Health Workforce for Geriatric PopulationsThe need to enhance the geriatric healthcare workforce is not a new issue. In 2008, the IOM issued a report highlighting U.S. requirements for expanding and preparing the geriatric healthcare workforce to meet the needs of an older population. Shortly after, Congress mandated that the IOM conduct a study specifically addressing the MH/SU workforce needs for older adults. The report focused on engaging a broad range of professional disciplines and training and education levels, but also engaging peer supporters and informal caregivers.Important recommendations outlined in thisIOM commission report(IOM, 2012) include:Modifications to the Medicare and Medicaid payment structure and rules to include coverage for key mental health services including counseling, care management, and other mental health services;Emphasis on updating accreditation requirements for the broader healthcare workforce that serves older adults to recognize signs and symptoms of mental health and substance misuse and provide basic care and referrals; andPromote national attention toward building and strengthening a workforce that can meet the needs of an aging population by engaging the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to designate a responsible entity to address this issue and ensure that its agenciesincluding the Administration on Aging, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), SAMHSA, etc.assume responsibility in their capacities to address this issue.The IOM report also outlined the barriers to building and strengthening the geriatric MH/SU workforce. Some of these barriers include a lack of interest in geriatrics due to cultural stigma, lack of financial incentives and pay structures for service provision, lack of specialty training opportunities in geriatrics, lack of support and mentorship in this area, and limited diversity in the current geriatric care workforce.What has been done since?Congress passed the OMNIBUS federal budget and the Consolidated Appropriations Act (2023) that was signed into law by President Biden on Dec. 29, 2022. This legislation included new programs and policies addressing mental health needs of older Americans.Important 2023 Omnibus Legislation policy investments include:Provider Expansion: Beginning in January 2024, services provided by mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists will be covered by Medicare Part B, significantly expanding the geriatric workforce. There also are provisions for Medicare-funded residency positions and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery loan repayment program.Increased Service Coverage: The omnibus also expands Medicare access to telehealth, intensive outpatient, crisis psychotherapy, and behavioral health integration services.PEERS Act: The law authorizes funding in grants to provide peer-supported mental health services, including virtual support. It includes provisions from the PEERS Act to ensure that peer support specialist services will be covered by Medicare.There also have been some recent changes in the CMS Fee Schedule that benefit MH/SU service provision for older adults. Relevant updates in theCMS 2023 Physician Fee Scheduleinclude:Behavioral Health Integration (BHI): The incident to regulation now allows behavioral health services to be provided under the general, rather than direct, supervision of a physician or non-physician practitioner, when these services or supplies are furnished by auxiliary personnel, such as licensed professional counselors and licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFTs).A new General BHI code describes a service personally performed by clinical psychologists or clinical social workers to account for monthly care integration where the mental health services furnished by a psychologist or social worker serve as the focal point of care integration. CMS is finalizing the proposal to allow a psychiatric diagnostic evaluation to serve as the initiating visit for the new general BHI service.Chronic Care Management and Interprofessional Consultation: Healthcare for older adults often requires a team-based approach. New Chronic Care Management codes facilitate this critical aspect of care.In addition, CMS now includes options for payment of interprofessional consultation, a necessary component of team-based care for older adults.Opioid Treatment Programs: The Calendar Year (CY) 2023 Physician Fee Schedule final rule includes revised pricing for the drug component of the methadone weekly bundle and the add-on code for take-home supplies of methadone. Additionally, CMS is changing the payment for the bundle to reflect 45 minutes of psychotherapy, an increase over the current standard of 30 minutes. There also are modifications allowing for certain audio-visual, audio-only, and mobile unit services.Chronic Pain Management Services: Chronic pain is prevalent, especially in adults older than age 65. New CMS codes expand billing for pain management services, including behavioral interventions. Note that mental health providers are to use Health & Behavior codes.How We Can Rise to the OccasionBroadly defining the geriatric MH/SU workforceThe complex interface between older adult mental and physical health issues means that team-based, interdisciplinary approaches are critical. Older adults are diagnosed and treated for mental health and substance use issues by a broad variety of providers in many settings. For example, older adults receive MH/SU services from their primary care providers, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and specialty MH/SU settings. Therefore, enhancing the geriatric MH/SU workforce must include engaging professionals who interface with older adults across settings and disciplines.All healthcare professionals and community-based organizations that provide support services to older adults must have basic competency in older adult mental health.The IOM lists several types of professionals included in this workforce, including physicians, psychiatrists, nurses, direct care workers, counselors, pharmacists, psychologists, social workers, and counselors, to name a few. Further, to increase the impact and availability of meeting MH/SU needs, we also must engage unlicensed parties to act on this issue, including community agencies and organizations, peer supporters, community health workers, and family caregivers.Need for more geriatric specialistsWhile the behavioral health workforce is vastly understaffed for all ages, by 2030, it is estimated that we will only have 27% of needed psychiatrists, 9% of needed social workers, and 5% of needed psychologists with specialized training in working with older adults (IOM, 2012; Jeste et al., 1999). The need may be even greater as trends are showing a more than 10% decline in psychiatrists from 2003 to 2013 (Bishop et al., 2016). As of 2018, the national average was 2.6 geriatric psychiatrists for every 100,000 adults older than age 65 (Beck et al., 2018), and there are currently only 112 board-certified geropsychologists in the United States (American Board of Geropsychology, 2022).An additional barrier to effective training of healthcare providers to meet the needs of older adults is a pipeline problem. Students are rarely exposed to older adults early in their educational careers, which could be addressed with intergenerational learning. Once in graduate programs, there are few training opportunities due to Medicare restrictions on billing for trainees, which contributes to the lack of mental health providers entering geriatrics as a specialty. While consideration must be given to allowing incident to billing for mental health trainees under the direct supervision of qualified licensed mental health clinicians, increased funding for training and incentives for entering geriatrics also is critical. Examples include expanding the HRSA-funded Graduate Psychology Education and Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education programs directed toward training in geriatrics, along with increasing focus on loan repayment programs for working with underserved older adults.Need for training generalistsIn addition to the task of increasing the number of trained geriatric specialists, we must simultaneously engage all healthcare professionals and community-based organizations that provide support services to older adults to have basic competency in older adult mental health. This is especially urgent for counselors and LMFTs, per the new CMS allowance to bill. As these providers historically havent been able to bill, their training programs rarely include older adult training. This trend also exists across mental health disciplines. Few doctoral psychology programs include geropsychology training opportunities or specialties. The Council of Professional Geropsychology Training Programs lists13 programswith geropsychology training. APA has accredited a total of417 programs, leaving only 3% with a dedicated geropsychology training program.One part of the solution is increasing funding for and availability of a variety of training options, e.g., asynchronous, synchronous, varied levels of time/investment. One such example is CATCH-ON, the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) based at Rush University Medical Center. CATCH-ON offers an online certificate program for generalist mental health clinicians to attain foundational competency in older adult mental health. This program also offers an annual in-person fellowship training to smaller cohorts of mental health clinicians to build both knowledge and skill in this area.If all GWEPs were to increase focus on the MH/SU needs of older adults, every region of the United States would have access to high quality training. Further, GWEPs are required to build partnerships with community-based organizations, including Area Agencies on Aging, which are ideal for expanding such training to the aging network and direct care workforce, as well as potentially other community organizations, first responders, and others who meet the needs of older adults. Proposed support for additional GWEPs with larger budgets would allow for these critical needs of older adults to be more effectively met. While most states have GWEPs, this additional funding may allow for every state to benefit from this essential workforce development program.Peer supporters also are an important part of the geriatric MH/SU workforce.Rush University Medical Centers SAMHSA-funded Engage, Educate, and Empower for Equity: E4 Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health Disparities in Aging has engaged more than 20,000 professionals between live and recorded educational events. The Center has focused efforts on creating educational materials for older adults and the geriatric workforce. It also has engaged eight states thus far in policy academies that bring together state entities that rarely communicate with each other, including mental health, substance use, aging, transportation, housing, Medicaid, and local chapters of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, to identify gaps in meeting the needs of older adults and generating a plan to begin to fill the gaps. For more details on this Centers mission, goals, and progress, please see the accompanying article in this issue ofGenerations Journal.Need for training culturally and linguistically diverse cliniciansCensus data show that older Americans are becoming more racially and ethnically diverse over time (Caplan & Rabe, 2023). We need a workforce that reflects the diversity of the population being served. Efforts in building cultural competence and humility also need to focus on supervisor training to ensure that adequate supervision can be in place.Need for engaging non-licensed providers and peer supportersInnovative models of care are needed as we aim to meet the demands in older adult MH/SU in the future. In addition to cultivating geriatric specialists and training generalists to meet the MH/SU needs of older adults, training and engaging non-licensed providers to deliver services can help expand the reach of services. One model that has been proposed involves deploying bachelors-level therapists (supervised by doctorate-level providers) to deliver treatments for certain mental health conditions.This model of care is cost-saving and optimizes professional practice at the top of ones skills and training. Research supports the effectiveness of such a model in the mental health context, as well as in other healthcare sectors, however, it comes with barriers. Infrastructure at the organizational and national levels must be in place to support implementation of such a model. This includes the standardization of treatment protocols, defining scope of practice and roles, and training for licensed providers on supervising non-licensed providers. Federal and state policies and appropriate payment structures also must be in place (Kunik et al., 2017).Peer supporters also are an important part of the geriatric MH/SU workforce. Peer supporters can help expand reach of services and support to address the shorting of trained providers. Peer support models of care involve training older adults with lived experience in MH/SU to provide basic support and assistance for older adults with MH/SU needs, throughout their treatment. Peer support models can be implemented in a variety of ways including in-person, virtual/telephone support, and in groups. Evidence is growing on the impact and scalability of such models of care (Thombs & Carboni-Jimnez, 2021). Community health workers with or without lived experience of MH/SU also can play a critical role in service support.Need for improved Medicare and Medicaid reimbursementVery little progress can be made until the proper billing structures are in place. Historically, MH/SU services have been poorly reimbursed, creating a major bottleneck in service provision for older adults. Medicare and Medicaid have lower rates of reimbursement than many commercial insurance companies, disproportionately disincentivizing providers from service provision to older adults, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged. In fact, psychiatrists are less likely than other types of physicians to accept all types of insurance (including Medicare and Medicaid), contributing to this gap in care (Bishop et al., 2014).Without providers opting in, older adults dont get services (CMS, 2015). This is especially true for individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles), many of whom have serious mental illness, often with comorbid substance misuse, because they are required to navigate two separate and confusing systems, and rarely have the resources to consider out-of-network options.CMS billing structures also must accommodate and promote integrated, team-based care. Optimal care for all adults coordinates mental and physical health care (Druss et al., 2017). This is particularly the case for older adults with disorders ranging from depression (Unutzer et al., 2002) to serious mental illness (Druss et al., 2017; Vanderlip et al., 2014, 2017), to substance misuse (Englander et al., 2019).Unfortunately, Medicare Advantage plans have been allowed to split contracts for physical and behavioral health services so that older adults often cannot receive services in one coordinated setting. Moreover, older adults seeking treatment for MH/SU concerns at their primary care providers may leave empty-handed, as many primary care providers dont know where to send older adults for care and cant make proper referrals.ConclusionsThe MH/SU needs of older adults are complex and with a growing population of older Americans, we must take immediate action to build and strengthen the broad MH/SU workforce through various strategies at practice and policy levels. Key areas for impact include broadly engaging a variety of professionals and supporters to provide MH/SU care for older adults, increasing training opportunities to support growth in geriatric specialists, equipping generalists with basic competencies in older adult MH/SU issues, increasing diversity and cultural competency in the geriatric MH/SU workforce, engaging non-licensed providers and peer supporters, and calling for improved Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for pertinent services and policy reform to address cracks in the current payment structures. Although some progress has been made since the 2012 IOM report, there is much more progress to be made.Susan Buehler, PhD, is an assistant professor at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Ill.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpring 2024See Me! Hear Me! Know Who I Am!By Bonnie GenevayApril 24, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingThis piece originally ran in the Spring 1997 edition ofGenerations.The Editorial Advisory Board found it remains relevant to this day (if not more so) and pertinent to this issue on Mental Health, Aging, and Resilience. Bonnie was a beloved member of the American Society on Aging and the former ASA Mental Health and Aging Network (MHAN). She fell in love with the field of aging in middle-age and spent the rest of her life working as a gerontologist, publishing a variety of books related to countertransference and bereavement, teaching, and counseling older adults. Bonnies words remind us of how important it is to take a wholistic, person-centered approach when working with older adults.Who is the person inside? She was 92 years old in 1985, and this was her last homea nursing home. Her new physician came into her room and introduced himself. Although her confusion often hindered communication, this happened to be a good day. When he said, Im Dr. Brown, her 80-some years of experience in social intercourse came into play. She smiled, held out her hand, and looked up at him out of the corner of her eyesher vamp look from the 1920s.He began immediately with the mental status exam, and she did all right until he asked, And who is the president of the United States? As soon as she paused and that lost look came into her eyes, I knew she couldnt remember. I wanted to plead with Dr. Brown: Be slow, be gentle; enter her worldplease dont make her feel dumb. Shes had so many presidents from the 1890s until now!But she rallied quickly. Her old charm came through as she replied, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, of course! then she laughed as if it were a joke, and looked in his eyes to see if hed join in the humor. I could tell she was buying timehoping the right presidents name would fall into her mind while the doctor observed the social niceties. Shed always been interested in politicsit was a point of pride with her. But Dr. Brown kept his perfectly impassive face, silently jotted a note on her chart (she flunked Current Events), and went on to the next question.This woman was my mother. I still wish Dr. Brown could have spent even three or four more minutes in getting to know my mother, allowing her to feel a little more comfortable with him. And I wish hed understood that this was not a neutral process but a social event for her! Shed always liked handsome young men, and this young gentleman had come to call on her. She expected him to laugh with her, for, as shes always said, A little humor never hurt anyone! Most of the people shed known were dead, and Mom needed to be seen and heard in all the splendor of her lifelong identitynot as a label in a chart.Assessment and the AssesseeAlthough I was a family counselor with elderly people for many years, one of my primary roles the past few years has been that of consumer of aging services. I have become the assessee instead of the assessor, and I have learned a great deal I wish Id known 25 years ago. Ive found that some professionals dont seem to care about any other parts of me (my experience, my smarts, my perception of my own functioning) except the slice of me they are currently assessing. What ever happened to the notion that the whole is the sum of its parts?I have become the assessee instead of the assessor, and Ive learned a great deal I wish Id known 25 years ago.I think of assessment as a measure of well-being of physical, mental, social, emotional, and spiritual functioning that goes far beyondformalassessment (as in the following instruments were utilized in gerontological assessment of the subject ). In fact, if you ever refer to me as a subject, Ill refuse to be assessed! I learned this perspective over 20 years ago from a feisty 80-year-old who overheard me referring to her as the client during a phone call. When I got off the phone she said, My names JoAnne. Dont you ever call me the client again or you can take your services and ! To me, assessment should include everything that happens in human interaction between me and my care providers that allows them to diagnose, treat, and care for me.The Context: The Whole PersonThe first orthopedic surgeon showed me two X-rays: my right hip and the right hip of an 85-year-old man. Now you can see howlittlearthritis you have, compared to this mans, he said, pointing to the fuzzy white joint areas. We only replaced his hip last year. I recommend that you go home, increase your dosage of anti-inflammatories, and come back next year. Youre not ready for surgery yet.I wondered how he could have failed to understand how much pain I experienced and how poorly I functioned. Id certainly tried to tell him. I didnt care how great my X-ray looked! He was assessing me by my X-rays, and they were only a picture of one body part. I was taking too many pain killers in order to be able to work, and I spent the majority of my time at home shuffling from bed to toilet to couch with my walker.Unable to cope, I sought a second orthopedic surgeon, who assessed me from an entirely different perspective. Your X-ray doesnt look too bad, but from the pain youre describing Im assuming you have a very inflammatory kind of arthritis in this joint. If youre ready for a new hip, I am. Relief flooded my pores! Here was someone who believed me when I said I couldnt move without pain, I couldnt sleep, and I could drive my car only with great difficulty. I was certainly seen and heard by this assessor of my functioning. He looked at the whole person.Good Assessments I Have KnownOne of the best assessments I have ever had came from a wonderful occupational therapist who prepared me to live at home after my hip replacement. She observed me so carefully that I implicitly trusted her assessment of my new capabilities, and as a result I risked behavior and activities I wouldnt have tried without her. She demonstrated again and again with her own body how I should walk, how I should bend, and I felt we were a team in my learning to walk right again. She tested my potential daily but didnt push me beyond my limits. Her assessment of my level of functioningand my potential levelwas almost mystical in its accuracy.Assessment Determines Treatment and ServicesI feel great ambivalence about assessment interviews like the ones I received before I left the hospital after surgery. They had much more to do with diagnosis-related groups, money, arbitrary categories, and staffing problems than they did with my capacity to live alone at home after surgery. I felt panic at not being told until the last minute whether I would receive rehabilitation in a rehab unit (daily) or at home (much less frequently). I didnt yet have the confidence to survive on my own, yet I wanted to be as independent and undemanding as possible. In order to be deemed eligible for the rehab I felt I needed, I would have to demonstrate considerable deficits in functioning. This situation proved to be demeaning to meI had to be an actress to get what I believed I needed and deserved. I was reminded that Mrs. Jones, who is older than you, went straight home with her new hip last week.My fears strongly affected by assessment interview with the hospital discharge planner. I felt manipulative and two-faced as I tried to present myself as just dysfunctional enough to need nursing home rehabilitation, but not so dysfunctional that I appeared to be a baby or a hypochondriac. I didnt believe that my perception of my own functioning would count for anything in this assessment. The issue was whether I could cook and go to the bathroom at home alone the fourth day after surgery, not how terrified I was. It was never clear from the discharge planning assessment what the parameters were. Each person (doctor, planner, occupational therapist, physical therapist, social worker) disclaimed power in the evaluation and decision making. I felt utterly powerless.Power and EmpowermentTheres no question about it. The assessor has the power. Our diagnosis, treatment, and services as patients and clients depend on assessment. In 1994 I experienced extreme gastrointestinal distress while working in Florida. I thought it was from some gulf shrimp Id eaten. After I flew home and the pain continued, I was hospitalized for a week. The medical team couldnt diagnose the problem. The attending physician, a gastroenterologist, and the nursing staff were wonderful, however, in terms of letting me in on the assessment process! I was subjected to scans, ultrasounds, endoscopies, and many other tests and interviews that can leave one feeling like a guinea pig. But the medical team kept me informed of what they knew and what they didnt know, and I felt included in the process. When the pain gradually dissipated at the end of the week, I went home.'The process of being assessed by people who saw me as a whole human being with intelligence was affirming and empowering.'What sticks with me is not the pain or the fact that they couldnt diagnose my problem, but the way each professional acknowledged uncertainty responded to my questions thoughtfullywith and without answers, and told me the truth. I felt honored as a person. They asked for my input frequently, as if I might actually know something! (I did. It was my body and my pain.)The process of being assessed by people who saw me as a whole human being with intelligence was affirming and empowering. I know what being valued as an old person feels like and I will continue to ask for that kind of treatment the rest of my life. If Im too frail or demented to demand such respect, I pray some enlightened helper will provide it.Assessment and AssertivenessBecause I am vocal and assertive enough to make my voice heard, I do not allow people assessing me to ignore my contribution. I take more of their time because my answers arent always one-word responses. But it empowers me immensely! Being this assertive is not always possible for frail elders who do not speak English or who are depressed, submissive, or confused, and they need advocates in the assessment process. But many quite old people do very well at being heard!When my mother was 90, and weighed about 90 pounds, she greatly frustrated a professional caregiver in her small town because she wanted him to speak toherabout her conditionnot to her middle-aged daughter. He ignored Mom, looked at me, and spoke about her in her presence as if she werent in the room: Your mother appears to and What she needs is This fierce little client (my mom) shouted at him, Look at me! Talk tome! Dont tellherwhat I should do. (Ive never been more proud of my mother. She may possibly have taught that professional the critical lesson of seeing, hearing, and learning to know old people and paying attention to their own understanding of their problems.)Theres No Magic Formula for AssessmentWhat is assessment from the older persons perspective? Many different things. Ive only given you one old persons perspectivemine. Theres no magic formula for assessmentwere all so different. We are more individual and different from others when we grow old than at any other time of our lives. My desire to be involved in the assessment process may be very different from the wishes of the older person who has willingly given away body, mind, and emotions to others to diagnose and treat. A friend my age described it this way: I want the professionals to tell me whats wrong and what theyre going to do about it; I want no part of it. Then if they make mistakes, its their fault and I can blame them!My values and my experience tell me that the primary job of the one who assesses old people is to see us, hear us, and know who we arein all our complexity, competence, and need for autonomy. Our many enmeshed mental, emotional, social, physical, and spiritual symptoms make it very difficult to assess us at times. I, for one, do not expect you to cure me of all the problems I have accumulated in my lifetime. But I do hope you will be able to be with me as I struggle with the end results of my heredity, my environment, and my life choices. And maybejust maybeIll be able to contribute to the very challenging and difficult task of assessment. If you want my contribution, all you have to do is ask!Bonnie Genevay, MSW, was a writer and trainer and consultant in gerontology and bereavement, based in Seattle, WA.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202324Consulting Program by and for Older DetroitersBy Tam E. Perry, Vanessa Rorai, JoAnn Smith, James R. Bridgforth, Brenda F. Evans, Adelia Cooley, Jamie Mitchell, and Kent KeyFebruary 14, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureJustice & EquityAbstract:This article profiles a program in Detroit, MI, funded by the National Institute on Aging, called the Michigan Center for African American Aging Research and its key offshoot the Healthier Black Elders Center (HBEC). Board members of its Community Advisory Board weigh in on key programming and offer perspectives and recommendations on health and social issues. The HBEC Consulting Program is a blend of formal volunteering and paid work through consulting fees. The article also outlines next steps for HBEC.Key Words:Healthier Black Elders Center, Community Advisory Board, health equity, older African AmericansWe are involved in so many areas, so many creative and relevant topics, that will inspire others to want to learn from us in the future.JoAnn Smith, Community Advisory Board member for more than 20 years, Healthier Black Elders Center, Detroit, MichiganSince 1997, the National Institute on Aging has funded the Michigan Center for African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR) to promote health equity among older African Americans and mentor emerging scientists interested in African-American aging research trajectories (Chadiha et al., 2011, Lichtenberg et al., 2011). Through the Community Liaison and Recruitment Core of MCUAAAR, the Healthier Black Elders Center (HBEC) emerged as a key part of this program and continues to engage more than 1,100 members (see MCUAAAR.org).Partnering with local organizations, churches, and community groups has established a trusted relationship and deep commitment between older African Americans and the HBEC. HBEC Community Advisory Board (CAB) member JoAnn Smith explained, This program has been a viable service for health awareness in the African American community for over 20 years. The Healthier Black Elders Center works because of the people, the coordinators, staff, the board members, researchers, and of course the Lunch & Learn professional presenters, and our seniors. There has always been a harmonious team effort to work together for the benefit of the community which we serve.A 16-member CAB oversees all HBEC programming by offering perspectives and recommendations on health and social issues relevant to older adults in Detroit (Mitchell et al., 2020). CAB members are older adults who relate to the concerns of HBEC members, such as caregiving, disease prevention, chronic illness, and the citys infrastructure and financial challenges. The CAB meets regularly and gets involved in many aspects of programming, including member outreach, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic (see Rorai & Perry, 2020; Rorai et al., 2021), and programming specific to social determinants of health called Critical Crossroads (e.g., applying for FEMA funds, the possible impact of a federal shutdown).While 2020 brought a global catastrophe that challenged the older adult community in Detroit (Archambault et al., 2020; Perry et al., 2021; Harris et al., 2023), HBEC launched a consulting program involving CAB members and Center faculty and staff. Each consultation is unique, designed to meet the needs of the client. Some consultations are a one-time meeting with a specified number of CAB members to get feedback on study materials, while other consultations are multiple meetings over a period of time.Coordinated by the HBEC Coordinator Vanessa Rorai, and HBEC Faculty Leader Dr. Tam Perry, the consulting program works with researchers and organizations to provide consultation on individual research projects (such as design, materials, disseminating results, protocols, and more) and public presentations on best practices to engage older adults in research (such as workshops, conferences, symposiums, and podcasts). The consulting program builds upon the strengths already present in the HBEC, which has been serving the community for more than 2 decades and understands the communitys needs and wants. CAB members note that HBEC can get the pulse of the community easily, as needed.The program works with researchers and organizations to provide consultation on individual research projects and presentations on best practices to engage elders in research.While the HBEC CAB are active members of their community, we believe the consulting program is unique in its approach. Many CAB members are involved in other volunteer capacities with their churches, block clubs, and local corporations. They are accustomed to sharing social and health information within the Metro Detroit community, participating in research opportunities through HBECs research registry, and they have been part of research dissemination via presenting in numerous venues. The consulting program brings a professional approach to providing input. Long-serving CAB member James Bridgforth notes, We have a chance to put perspectives from the older adult African-American community point of view and have an opportunity to have influence over the outcome of projects.HBEC Consulting OutcomesSince 2020, the HBEC CAB, related faculty, and staff have completed 17 consultancies with a wide range of outcomes. Almost half of them have directly affected research design. Projects focused on enhancing caregiving support, adapting technology for older minority adults, promoting adherence to glaucoma medication, and designing a protocol to appropriately reveal results in Alzheimers research.Another important consultancy offered guidance to a national foundation on funding priorities that would benefit older adults. This consultancy took place in advance of the foundation issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) to nonprofits in several major U.S. cities.In addition to consulting on specific projects, the program provided perspectives to multiple audiences. Often, in these projects, staff, faculty, and CAB members co-present to demonstrate HBECs commitment to best practices in community-based research (Israel et al., 1998) and equitable ways to work with community advisory boards to promote engagement (Mitchell et al., 2020). Audiences have included students, junior and senior faculty, older adult community members, grant funders, practitioners serving older adults, and companies considering ways older adults interface with technology.The remaining consultancies were public presentations at webinars, symposiums, workshops, and a podcast interview. These presentations focused on best practices to engage older minoritized adults in research, recruitment strategies, promoting the value of community-based work, and developing and using advisory boards. Proceeds from the program are allocated to support the HBEC program, CAB members, and HBEC leaders who participate in each consultancy.Contributing to Health Promotion for Older AdultsThis programs innovative approach coincides with the long-standing mission of the Healthier Black Elders Center, which is, To work to improve the health and well-being of elderly minorities by encouraging research that will produce knowledge focused on understanding the aging process, disease and disability prevention, health promotion, healthier lifestyles, and successful aging in Detroit and beyond.As CAB member Brenda Evans, explained:This consulting program is unique in the way it actively recruits CAB members of varied experience and expertise. Thus, bringing a centralized pool of older adult partners to the table for dialogue and input on varied research projects and programs early in the process and throughout their implementation where indicated. In our roles as consultants, CAB members focus on the multifaceted ways that researchers can safely incorporate African Americans from metro Detroit into research. This is important to add applicability of findings to a more diverse population as well as increase diversity from the paltry 5% or less typically seen.Deepening TrustIn addition to serving clients interests, the HBEC Consulting program has allowed others to become more aware of the work being done at the HBEC and the Wayne State University Institute of Gerontology. At HBEC events, there is often opportunity for attendees to meet African American researchers and professional African American presenters, as well as scholars of many backgrounds who are examining racial differences including access to healthcare and chronic diseases and Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). As another key goal of the MCUAAAR is to mentor scientists, it is important to have opportunities for community members to meet some of these scientists who often have involved members in their studies.At HBEC events, attendees can meet African American researchers and professional African American presenters, as well as scholars.While HBEC hosts many events in the metro Detroit area for older adults (e.g., Lunch & Learns, booths to recruit new members), this program has invited other sectors (funders, technology) in addition to research teams to learn about the work of the HBEC and the experiences of older African Americans. Two consultancies resulted in two community education events for HBEC members with clients presenting the outcome of their projects. The presentations highlighted the benefits of CAB members involvement consulting on their projects, while also sharing pertinent health information on memory changes and the use of technology. These are noted examples of how a consultancy has led to benefiting HBEC programing and deepening the trust with HBEC members when they hear about CABs input on designing projects.Promoting Productive AgingIn line with this special issue focused on Promoting Long, Healthy, and Productive Lives for Everyone, the HBEC Consulting Program is a blend of formal volunteering and paid work through consulting fees. As CAB member Adelia Cooley said, I am not only offering my recommendation and expertise, I am also gaining knowledge and awareness that I may not have otherwise acquired. I consider my HBEC Consultancy role as a two-way streetI gain understanding and I give understanding. Both of which I trust to be valuable.This blend is part of the next phase of activities of the HBEC contributing to health promotion for older adults, deepening trust, and promoting engagement. We hope that this example shows the level of intensity of the contributions made by HBEC Consulting productive. For more consulting examples, go toHBEC-Consultancies_forwebpage.pdf (mcuaaar.org).A CAB member for more than 20 years, James Bridgforth aptly describes the blend of how his formal volunteering directly draws upon his previous professional experiences. He brings work experience in management, working with people/clients, being accountable for budgets, outcomes, and projects to the consulting program.He also brings more than 20 years of working in the community as a leader and CAB member of various organizations including the HBEC CAB. He has contributed to HBEC in many roles including on the Critical Crossroads Social Determinants of Health committee and the COVID-19 Telephone Outreach Project committee. He sees this program as, an opportunity for CAB members to share their past professional expertise/skills in new settings, and notes his response to being part of the program. When asked how his voice and perspectives have been perceived, he said, positively, as evidenced by being encouraged to continue and the group reacting positively to my input.HBEC CAB members feel strongly that not all CAB members need to bring professional expertise to the consulting program, as their experiences aging as an African American are valued regardless of previous work history and education levels. The ability to contribute both professional and personal experiences lies at the heart of this program.Call to ActionWe propose the following calls to action:Recognize and value the contributions of older adults to the planning and implementation of projects from many sectors.Involve older adults in research projects as mentors.Document more older minoritized examples of productive engagement in the academic literature, and in resources produced for older adults and practitioners serving older adults.Acknowledgments:We would like to acknowledge all the faculty and staff involved in the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research, as well as the RCMAR National Coordinating Center (Principal Investigators: Robert J. Taylor, Peter Lichtenberg, Joan Ilardo). We also would like to thank all the members of the HBEC who shared their experiences and voices by participating in so many HBEC programs and pertinent research studies.And we would like to thank former CAB members, some no longer with us, who worked so diligently to make this program what it is today.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202324Multigenerational Advocacy Among Sexual and Gender MinoritiesBy Angela K. PeroneFebruary 14, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureJustice & EquityHealth & Well-beingAbstract:In our increasingly polarizing society, we have been inundated with news stories that perpetuate stereotypes of different generations and lament a great generational divide. But researchers and practitioners paint a very differentmore optimisticpicture of multigenerational advocacy. For sexual and gender minorities (SGMs), multigenerational advocacy helps address lingering disparities and structural inequities. To be most effective, however, we must broaden our understanding of engagement across generations, expand our definition of advocacy, and call in SGM community members and allies for change.Key Words:LGBTQ+, race, aging, intergenerational, advocacy, engagementWe are witnessing increasing political polarization across the world. In the United States, partisan divides are particularly robust and have only grown since the pandemic. Amidst acrimonious debates about COVID-19, media outlets increasingly emphasized a growing generational divide. However, this media coverage masked the growth and evolution of multigenerational advocacy.On Twitter, #BoomerRemover emerged in March 2020 to refer to COVID-19 deaths of older adults, and media reports stressed a generational divide between the Millennial and Baby Boomer generations (Sparks, 2020). But research examining these tweets found that a majority of them emphasized the impact of COVID-19 on younger adults or that the hashtag was disrespectful or problematic, or invoked the hashtag to advocate for political issues during the 2020 election (Sipocz et al., 2021; Skipper & Rose, 2021). These tweets sparked multigenerational conversations and debates. Nearly a quarter of the tweets used the hashtag to call for intergenerational connectivity (Sipocz et al., 2021).COVID-19 sparked similar calls for multigenerational advocacy among sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities. During the pandemic, I served as the executive director of a small community-based organization that focused on services and advocacy for SGM older adults in the Detroit Metro region. We were the only organization in Michigan focused specifically on SGM older adults. In the beginning of the pandemic, we were inundated with calls about food insecurity, social isolation, and concerns about accessing medical care. We served communities at critical intersections of risk for COVID-19 given their race, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and health conditions. We saw firsthand what has now been repeatedly confirmed in research, which is that the communities we served died at higher rates and encountered more health complications from COVID-19 than did their white, cisgender, heterosexual younger peers.But, when Michigan policymakers organized the first town hall in Michigan to address COVID-19 among SGM communities, they failed to include anything about SGM older adults on the agenda. Initially, no one from our organization received an invitation to attend. We finally received a formal invitation to the conversation after partner organizations (many who served SGM youth or young adults) advocated for our inclusion. The multigenerational advocacy that occurred behind the scenes was invisible to most participants at this event. However, it sparked important policy, funding, and service changes throughout the pandemic that elevated the diverse voices, needs, and assets of SGM older adults. This example is one of many that underscores the benefits of multigenerational advocacy among SGM communities.Emerging and Enduring Issues for Sexual and Gender MinoritiesResearch on SGMs has documented numerous issues that pose challenges to social, health, political, and economic well-being. SGM youth and older adults face significant health disparities compared to heterosexual, cisgender peers (Fredriksen Goldsen & de Vries, 2019; Hudaisa et al., 2017). SGMs also report financial challenges (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2023; Lee Badgett et al., 2019) related to years of employment and housing discrimination, inequities in insurance access, and education disparities, among other structural barriers to economic mobility. These challenges are heightened among SGMs of color (Garcia-Perez, 2020; Kum, 2017).Many SGMs report that discrimination experiences are common, including slurs, microaggressions, harassment, unequal treatment, and violence (Casey et al., 2019; Grant et al., 2011; Romanelli & Lindsey, 2020). Discrimination also can surface at structural or macro levels. For example, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU; 2023) reported in mid-2023 that nearly all 50 states had introduced a total of almost 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills in the United States.A multigenerational focus also provides opportunities to reconceptualize aging and services for older adults via an equity lens.These bills limit access to information in books about SGMs; preclude updating gender information on identification cards and records; ban affirming care for trans youth or create criminal penalties for providing care; prohibit trans people from using public accommodations like public bathrooms or locker rooms; prevent trans students from participating in school activities like sports or censor in-school discussions about SGMs; and undermine discrimination laws by allowing employers, businesses, or healthcare providers to refuse services or care. When nondiscrimination laws are passed, they often include exemptions for employers, businesses, or healthcare providers for religious, moral, or even professional reasons to deny services (Akers, 2021; Perone, 2020). SGMs also often are rendered invisible in large surveys or other forms of data collection, which can limit access to services and funding.Still, sexual and gender minorities comprise communities with creative social supports and collective resilience, which may help mitigate these challenges. Many of these support networks have been built out of necessity, but have created communities that have moved beyond surviving and are thriving. Emerging research on multigenerational programming among SGMs also suggests that multigenerational activities could provide important community benefits as well as individual support and knowledge transfer among SGM communities (Kazaleh Sirdenis et al., 2019; Perone et al., 2020; Robson et al., 2018). A multigenerational approach in advocacy also could provide an important tool to combat some of these growing challenges.What Does Multigenerational Mean for Sexual and Gender Minorities?Using the wordmultigenerationalshifts the paradigm of thinking about who to engage and how to engage different generations in advocacy. Research examining interactions among SGM generations tends to focus on intergenerational communication, relationships, or programs among youth or young adults and older adults (e.g., Hajek & Giles, 2002; Robson et al., 2018). Given rising concerns about social isolation (and with good reason), intergenerational interventions have foregrounded developing relationships across two generations to build intimacy, trust, and social support (e.g., Openhouse, 2022; Perone et al., 2020).Multigenerational approaches include programs that foster relationship-building among more than two generations. Multigenerational approaches also allow for more generational nuance by creating subgroups among youth (or younger adults) and older adults that correspond with different historical experiences. For example, programs that lump older adults into one generational group may miss the fact that the older adults category could include four generations.Researchers have identified three historical generations among SGM older adults: Invisible, Silenced, and Pride Generations (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2017). The Invisible Generation came of age during worldwide wars, a global economic depression, and at a time when ones sexual orientation and gender identity were not discussed or disclosed. The Silenced Generation came of age during the Lavender Scare when coming out as SGM could result in employment termination, educational or military expulsion, termination of parental rights, incarceration, or invasive and involuntary medical procedures. The Pride Generation came of age during the civil rights movement, gay liberation, and collective calls for change.A newer and younger group of older adultscomposed of Baby Boomers who came of age during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990scould arguably be called the Caregiver Generation, given the creative caregiving networks and supports that emerged among this generational cohort in response to the AIDS crisis. Multigenerational advocacy recognizes the benefits of advocacy among these generational subgroups of older adults as well as advocacy among Generation X, Millennial, and Generation Z SGMs.A multigenerational focus also provides opportunities to reconceptualize aging and services for older adults via an equity lens. While many government programs define older adults at ages 60 or older, a racial justice lens would include younger ages. Decades of discrimination or stress among SGMs can wear the body down, which is exacerbated for SGMs navigating concurrent forms of oppression (e.g., racism, xenophobia). Thus, programs, services, and funding for older adults that incorporate a racial justice lens might begin at age 50 (or even 45).The intersections of race and poverty exacerbate these realities. For example, the average life span of someone who is unhoused is shorter by about 17.5 years than the general population (Romaszko et al., 2017), and the average life expectancy of unhoused persons is 42 to 52 years old (Stedman, 2022). Given that nearly 30% of SGM youth, and up to 45% of Native/Indigenous SGM youth, have experienced homelessness (Trevor Project, 2022), SGM communities are particularly impacted by this life stressor.Multigenerational approaches provide space for multiple generations to engage, support, and grow together. Multigenerational advocacy among SGMs, thus, includes advocacy by multiple people across the age spectrum and across various generations to collectively seek change that improves the lives of SGMs.Expanding AdvocacyAdvocacy tends to evoke images of lobby days or other forms of political advocacy on pending bills. And while there is a bevy of deeply problematic bills at state and federal levels in the United States, multigenerational advocacy among SGM communities can encompass so much more. For example, multigenerational advocacy could include efforts to increase visibility in data collection or government surveys, or to encourage local, state, or even federal policymakers to lower the age to receive certain services or benefits, particularly for communities whose life expectancy is much shorter, given cumulative structural barriers. While most state and federal laws prohibit differential services based on race, sexual orientation (and sometimes gender identity), lowering the age based on life conditions (e.g., being unhoused) also could positively impact BIPOC and SGM communities who are disproportionately unhoused.The brief did not address the legal merits of the case but instead focused on research about discrimination toward SGM residents in nursing homes and urged the court to uphold the law.Policymaking has changed significantly in the past few years, and multigenerational advocacy could leverage these changes to create new pathways for change. As political polarization has grown, Congress has become much less effective at passing bipartisan legislation. Administrative agencies and courts have become much larger policymaking bodies. This reality, however, leaves open wide pathways of possibility for multigenerational advocacy among SGM communities in administrative agencies and courts.Executive administrative agencies are charged with developing, enforcing, and overseeing the many rules and regulations in the United States. They increasingly have exercised their discretion to implement federal regulations, technical guidance, FAQs, and other documents that clarify or explain myriad issues and sometimes controversial topics that have otherwise been punted by Congress. SGM communities have rapidly turned to multigenerational advocacy to create change through administrative agencies, and greater use of this tool could strengthen overall advocacy efforts. For example, when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, it included the first federal civil rights law that banned sex discrimination in healthcare. SGM organizations representing a multigenerational advocacy network worked closely with the Obama administration to ensure that this nondiscrimination protection included SGMs, and in May 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued final regulations clarifying that this protection included sexual orientation and gender identity (Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 2016).A multigenerational network again advocated for the Biden administration to reaffirm these protections after the Trump Administration removed them from the definition of sex discrimination. Healthcare discrimination impacts access to care for SGMs, regardless of age. Under Obama- and Biden-era regulations, Section 1557 prohibits discrimination against trans youth seeking affirming care. It prohibits nursing homes from denying care to gay residents. It prohibits doctors from providing pediatric care to the child of a same-sex couple. It prohibits health insurance companies from using blanket exclusions to deny coverage for transgender people. SGMs of color are disproportionately impacted by healthcare discrimination, regardless of age. A multigenerational (and multiracial) advocacy effort was critical to ensuring that these protections were affirmed (and reaffirmed) through the executive branch.Researchers and practitioners can provide expertise in court cases as expert witnesses or by writing amicus briefs. Expert witnesses primarily share their knowledge in depositions, through written declarations, and during trials. Expert witnesses become expert witnesses through a combination of professional accomplishments and word of mouth. SGM communities could develop multigenerational networks of experts that could be easily identified by attorneys at various points in a case. This network could be advertised widely among state and national SGM organizations, which could be especially useful for attorneys who are less plugged into these spaces.Amicus briefs provide another way for experts to engage in advocacy and often are used in cases that have wider impact than on the individual parties to the case. Amicus briefs are friend of the court documents that elaborate on a particular issue that the court should consider in this case but often falls outside the specific issue that the court has been asked to decide. For example, I organized a group of multigenerational researchers to write an amicus brief in a case pending before the California Supreme Court about whether the court should uphold a law prohibiting discrimination against SGM nursing home residents. The brief did not address the legal merits of the case but instead focused on research about discrimination toward SGM residents in nursing homes and urged the court to uphold the law.Multigenerational advocacy also can occur within organizations and agencies, and SGM communities can drive internal changes that can produce real impact in these spaces (e.g., employer health coverage, nondiscrimination policies). Moreover, multigenerational advocacy within organizations can include internal education across generations.I saw this unfold in my own organization as two program participants of different races, gender identities, and ages clashed and then grew into a stronger, more effective advocacy team. In June 2020, our nonprofit hosted a series of multigenerational hot topic conversations about social justice within SGM communities. George Floyd had just been murdered. The Trump Administration had recently reversed transgender health protections under Section 1557. And COVID-19 had taken a heavy toll on our community.Stories can help build empathy and context to understand how people see the world.During one of these conversations, a young, white, nonbinary participant (Danny) expressed frustration with an older Black same-gender-loving man (Calvin) for repeatedly referring to them as miss and her. Danny subsequently told staff that they felt threatened when Calvin aggressively clipped his nails while talking to them. After several heated conversations, they realized that they had a lot to learn from one another.Danny had no idea that Calvin had grown up in an era where he could face extreme violence (or death) from white men for disrespecting a white woman. Failing to use expected gendered salutations could spark such violence. Danny also did not know that Black men are often characterized as overly threatening or aggressive by white people.Calvin was unaware of the toll that repeated misgendering took on Dannys mental health and how it invalidated a sense of self that Danny had fought so hard to secure. Calvin had limited experience with transgender and nonbinary people, and Danny had limited experience with older Black men. Through these conversations, each of them advocated that their experiences be seenthat their voices be heardand they were. Subsequently they collaborated on several multigenerational projects that required staff, volunteers, and community members to have tough but very meaningful conversations. Through these conversations, they developed a stronger multigenerational advocacy team that was much more effective at seeking collective change.Calling in for ActionAmid increasing political polarization and campaigns calling out wrongs to be righted, a growing movement has advocated for a new approach: calling in those who could be allies, while advocating for change (e.g., Holmes et al., 2022). Calls for action, thus, become calling in for action. My experience with Danny and Calvin underscores how calling in can produce positive outcomes. Instead of writing Danny off as racist or Calvin off as transphobic, Danny and Calvin ultimately invited each other to understand their experiencesto learn from one anotherand to collectively use this understanding to become better advocates for SGM community members who were different from them. Efforts to engage in calling in are not always appropriate. It can be emotionally exhausting and sometimes overly taxing on communities who disproportionately experience injustice. But when the opportunity arises, such as it did with Danny and Calvin, approaches to call in for action can be powerful tools for multigenerational advocacy.Multigenerational advocacy incorporates a calling in approach that reaches across very different generational groups to learn from one another, identify common areas of concern, and collectively act to create change. To be clear, calling in does not eliminate the critical need to address oppression within SGM communities, including racism, ageism, xenophobia, transphobia, and ableism. Successful multigenerational advocacy acknowledges the many differences among SGM communities and finds ways to leverage or understand these differences to create stronger advocacy efforts.Calling in also can invite people to hear stories about ones lived experiences. Storytelling is a powerful tool for change. Coming out stories dramatically shifted the trajectory of SGM civil rights. SGMs were no longer someone elses child but were the very people we knew and loved. Stories can help build empathy and context to understand how people see the world.Calvin better understood why Danny was so frustrated with being misgendered after hearing how frequently it happened and how it impacted them. Danny better understood why Calvin struggled to break the habit of using gendered language after hearing stories of violence toward Black men Calvin knew who broke certain cultural and racialized norms for gendered salutations. Stories not only tell our histories. They tell our present lived experiences. And they tell our vision for the future.While working for a United States Senator, I met with numerous constituents advocating for bills or funding requests. One group stood out. This group included three people of various ages and life experiences who were advocating for more funding for a rare genetic disease. A young man began by sharing current facts and statistics about life with the disease. An older woman shared how she had provided care for her husband and then her son, who both died from the disease. Then a teenager shared how he lived with the disease. He concluded by sharing his vision for the future. Part of their success emanated from their multigenerational approach of storytelling to advocate for more funding for this disease.They called me in to learn more about this disease. To feel their stories. To hear their hope for change. Multigenerational advocacy can be a similar tool for change for SGM communities. As we navigate a seemingly polarizing world, let us invoke this tool to call one another in to create the change we know we need now and for future generations of SGM communities to come.Angela K.

ButtsFebruary 14, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:Intergenerational programs and shared sites, when done well, help debunk ageism and combat the epidemic of loneliness and social isolation felt acutely by younger and older people. The benefits for every age have been documented and deserve further research. The rich diversity among these programs has only recently been intentionally elevated as a community strength. Encouraging policy makers and funders to use an intergenerational-solutions lens can accelerate the development of programs that build bridges between generations. Professionals in aging play a key role in championing intergenerational solutions in their communities.Key Words:Intergenerational, diversity, advocacy, service, belonging, older adult, youth, community-planningAge segregation results in a frayed social compact and reinforces ageism by unfairly categorizing the young and the old. Our bookend generations are marginalized and overlooked for the critical role they play in holding our civil society together todaynot just yesterday or tomorrow. Policies, programs, and services that keep generations apart ignore what research and practice demonstrate again and againyounger and older people survive and thrive together (Generations United, 2021).Changing age-segregated institutions and policies will nurture each generation and our interdependence. Age integration would chip away not just at ageism, but at a host of other isms, too, and intergenerational programs shared use of spaces bridge artificial divides. Often classified as soft, these approaches are not just nice but necessary as our demographics change and challenge us.Evolution of Intergenerational ProgramsIntergenerational programs are defined as programs, policies, and practices that increase cooperation, interaction, and exchange between people of different generations, allowing them to share their talents and resources, and support each other in relationships that benefit individuals and their community (Generations United, 2010).These programs often are categorized by the direction of service, which includes young serving old, old serving young, and young and old serving together. Using these categories, however, can lead to overlooking a key element in the programsreciprocity. Quality intergenerational programs are intentional, reciprocal, respectful, purposeful, and value people at all ages and stages of life. They are built with the understanding that all generations benefit when relationships are forged between people of different age groups (Generations United, 2021).The concept of intentionally bringing generations together to serve as resources to each other and to their communities has become increasingly popular as a vehicle for addressing critical societal needs and strengthening cross-age relationships. Beginning in the 1960s with the Foster Grandparent and RSVP programs, early intergenerational programs focused primarily on dispelling age-related stereotypes, fostering cross-age understanding, reducing social isolation, and providing financial support for low-income elders (Henkin & Butts, 2012).Now a part of AmeriCorps Senior, these early programs evolved with the changing interests of older adults and expanding opportunities. While the original Foster Grandparents may have been content to rock babies, todays older adults are as likely to be interested in rocking the boat.Intergenerational Connections Are Urgently Needed and WantedIntentionally creating opportunities for cross-generational engagement is vital today as our country confronts an epidemic of social isolation and loneliness that is felt most acutely by older and younger people.In May 2023, the United States Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy released a new Surgeon General Advisory calling attention to the public health crises of loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection in our country. The physical health consequences of poor or insufficient connection include a 29% increased risk of heart disease, a 32% increased risk of stroke, and a 50% increased risk of developing dementia for older adults. Additionally, lacking social connection increases risk of premature death by more than 60%. Loneliness and isolation increase the risk for individuals to develop mental health challenges in their lives, and lacking connection can increase the risk for premature death to levels comparable to smoking daily (Office of the Surgeon General, 2023).Not only is connecting across generations good for all agesit is what people want.In the report,Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation, the Surgeon General (2023) proposed A National Strategy to Advance Social Connection. Two of the six pillars are especially germane to intergenerational solutions.The first pillar,Strengthen Social Infrastructure, points out that connections are influenced by physical elements in a community such as parks, libraries, and other community spaces. It calls upon communities to design environments that establish and scale community connection programs and invest in bringing people together. A new guide published by the American Planning Association provides a roadmap to do just this (Katz & Kaplan, 2023).The second pillar, which cuts across all the others, is toCultivate a Culture of Connection. Connections to people and to place are key to promoting a sense of belonging. This sense of belonging is diminishing, as pointed out in a recent national survey that found 68% of Americans feel a sense of non-belonging in the country overall, a number that rises to 74% who feel a sense of non-belonging in their local community (Argo & Sheikh, 2023). Cultivating a sense of belonging can be accomplished through frequent positive interactions grounded in care and concern (Johnson, 2023). A sense of belonging is ripe for cultivation via intergenerational programs that often result in cross-age friendships.Not only is connecting across generations good for all agesit is what people want.A 2017 Harris Survey conducted for Generations United and The Eisner Foundation found two in three adults would like to spend more time with people outside their age group. Nine out of 10 believe community programs that serve kids and older adults end up benefiting everyone. An overwhelming majority of adults77%wish there were more opportunities in their community for people from different age groups to meet and get to know one another. The survey also found 61% wanted parks, playgrounds, and recreation centers that cater to all ages, which points to a need to develop local infrastructure that support social infrastructure (Generations United & The Eisner Foundation, 2017).Diversifying Intergenerational ProgramsFlagship intergenerational programs and the pioneers who developed the field were a homogeneous group. Yet passing on culture, traditions, and skills from one generation to the next cuts across all racial and ethnic groups. With support from the RRF Foundation for Aging, Generations United launched the Diverse Intergenerational Programs Initiative to explore more deeply why documented intergenerational programs did not reflect the richness found in America and around the world.The initiative aimed to identify, advance, and build intergenerational solutions through a lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). As part of this initiative, Generations United established an advisory group to provide guidance and feedback, while developing tools and resources to honor the accomplishments of diverse intergenerational programs, encourage their development, support and elevate diverse practitioners and leaders in the field, and provide recommendations for programs seeking to elevate diversity internally and in their communities.In 2022 the initiative began with a national Survey of Programs Engaging Older and Younger People, to assess the diversity of intergenerational programs in the United States. This mixed-methods survey revealed that despite the hardships imposed by COVID-19 and other structural issues, intergenerational programs had maintained efforts to enhance community between generations, while still measuring their impact. The survey also examined the perspectives of staff by race and ethnicity, which revealed unique needs and challenges (Gonzales et al., 2022).Among the surveys findings:The top goals of the programs were to instill a strong sense of community; combat social isolation; and increase self-esteem, trust among ages, and academic achievement.Racial and ethnic minority staff identified top program goals as increased presence of positive role models, enhanced physical or mental health, and a greater understanding of issues facing young and old.Programs noted the importance of including diverse groups in intentional intergenerational programming.Overall, the main programmatic challenges reported by the programs were COVID-19, engagement of older adults from traditionally marginalized communities, and fundraising.Survey results indicated that a clear opportunity exists for greater engagement with existing and new intergenerational programs regarding how they practice DEI principles in programming, policies, evaluation, and funding (Gonzales et al., 2022). There is a need to increase efforts to highlight the work of diverse intergenerational programs and programs that are aspiring to be more diverse in their staffing practices and/or their desire to center traditionally marginalized communities via allyship.Intergenerational shared sites are designed to strengthen the web of support that is so integral to families and communities.The survey was the foundation for our reportStrengthening Cultural Responsiveness in Intergenerational Programs: Passion, Purpose, and Planning to Drive Equitable Change, released in 2023 (Generations United, 2023b). This report identifies culturally responsive intergenerational practices and provides recommendations for programs seeking to elevate diversity internally and externally. It also honors the accomplishments of diverse intergenerational programs, encourages their development, and supports diverse practitioners and leaders.More than 150 intergenerational programs were identified during the process. A few examples of those programs include:Center for Healthy Aging in Reno, NV: Teach Me To Grow Healthy (TMTGH) is an intergenerational community gardening project focused on creating a usable community-oriented, culturally sensitive program that improves fitness, nutritional support, mental health and holistic care of Indigenous and Non-Native older adult and youth communities. At TMTGHs garden, staff train the gardeners to engage in cross-cultural dialogue and encourage intergenerational work and story-sharing, while older adults and young people together learn how to grow, harvest, and distribute ancestral Indigenous foods and plants.Sharing Time with Elders Project (STEP) in Tumwater, WA: STEP is a volunteer program inspiring people to bridge intergenerational gaps through powerful conversations. It has partnered with the Squaxin Island and Nisqually tribes for The Elder Project, which includes an Indigenous oral history sharing project, intergenerational conversations via Zoom, and a Native elders-in-classrooms project. The goal is to capture stories and document them for future generations.Koreatown Youth & Community Centers (KYCC) Storytelling Program in Los Angeles, CA: KYCC is an intergenerational, multilingual, and multiethnic oral history and digital media program that teaches ethnographic and storytelling techniques to high school students and elders to investigate cultural practices and racial, economic, and health inequities in their community.Portland Youth and Elders Council in Portland, OR: This is a grassroots advocacy group open to everyone interested in building a strong civic connection with the local Native American community. Through intergenerational gatherings and the practice of traditional values, the Youth and Elders Council addresses local poverty and other issues by focusing on community solutions to housing, employment, education, health, and racism, while building on community strengths.Reach Out in Upland, CA: This nonprofits mission is to strengthen communities by bringing people together to solve the regions toughest issues: breaking barriers to educational achievement; expanding economic opportunities; and creating safe, healthy, and innovative communities. The program hosts networking events for young Latinx professionals and retirees with similar career interests and experience.Mi Casa, Inc., Genesis Intergenerational Program in Washington, DC: At this intergenerational housing development, young Black mothers who grew up in foster care live alongside Black elders in an affordable housing development that includes a community kitchen, meeting room, library, and garden.Elevating Shared Spaces and PlacesWhen cultural anthropologist and author Mary Pipher was named one of Next Avenues 2019 Top Influencers in Aging, she was asked what she would like to see in the future. She responded, I would like to see integrated public spaces, and integrated schools for ages two to eighty. I would like to see everything be multi-generational, so there would be many opportunities to connect within communities. Id like to do away with our age-segregated society (Next Avenue, 2019).Pipher advocated for rethinking how spaces and places are designed so they become hubs for connection, not single-age isolation. Not surprisingly, she isnt the only one interested in the concept of intergenerational shared sites. A 2018 survey conducted by the Harris Poll found that 4 in 5 Americans say that if they or a loved one needed care, they would prefer a setting where they can interact with people of different age groups verses a single age group. The vast majority (89%) thought that serving both children/youth and older adults at the same location is a good use of resources. (Generation United & The Eisner Foundation, 2018).Intergenerational shared sites are settings where children, youth, and older adults participate in services and/or programs concurrently at the same site or on the same campus. Participants interact during regular planned intergenerational activities, as well as through informal encounters. In addition to shared sites, these settings can be referred to as intergenerational spaces, centers, parks, and more. Research has shown that using facilities and outdoor spaces to connect generations benefits the participants, families, and communities (Generations United & the Eisner Foundation, 2021).One foundation offered a limited amount of funding for programs serving young or old and double that amount for proposals to engage more than one generation.Using an age-integrated rather than age-segregated approach, intergenerational shared sites are designed to strengthen the web of support that is so integral to families and communities. In these facilities, people of different ages come together to learn, play, and grow. Shared sites are more than physical places; they are shared spaces that have collective meaning for participants of different ages. Their relational focus differentiates them from multigenerational sites, which are designed primarily to accommodate the needs and abilities of different age groups but not necessarily promote cross-age interaction (Generations United & the Eisner Foundation, 2021).Inspiring examples include:Grace Living Center in Jenks, OK, where two Jenks Public Schools West Elementary pre-kindergarten and kindergarten classrooms are co-located with a skilled nursing facility. The littles (children) and the Grands (older adult residents) engage regularly in reading, shared study, dramatic play, gardening, friendly visiting in residents rooms, music, and ice cream socials.Little Tokyo Service Center in Los Angeles, CA, created an intergenerational garden program at an affordable housing community that engages its senior services and after-school youth program. Their Suehiro Cafe (oldest business) and CRFT by Maki (newest business) have formed an intergenerational collaboration to encourage the transfer of business skills between young and old.Ebenezer Ridges in Burnsville, MN, is home to a skilled nursing facility, adult day care, and senior housing. They opened a childcare center to attract and retain staff. In 2019 they reported that 60% of the children in that center were employees children. They offer intergenerational activities, including sharing meals, friendly visits, music, science, technology, physical activity, and learning programs (Generations United & the Eisner Foundation, 2019).Looking ForwardAround the country, young and old come together in exceptional intergenerational programs and sites that benefit everyone. Still, few of the programs are built to last or to scale and the sites often take years to develop. How do we make such programs the norm, encourage their expansion, and make them available to the large numbers of people who say this is what they want? Below are a few suggestions.Encourage local government to make age integration a core value.Local zoning, ordinances, and covenants can limit intergenerational opportunities. Challenge community leaders, policy makers, and other influencers to use an intergenerational solutions lens that asks simple questions such as those based on principles identified to advance intergenerational policies. These include:Make lifetime well-being for all generations the highest priority.Consider the impact of every action on each generation.Unite rather than divide the generations for the greatest social and financial impact.Recognize and support every generations ability to contribute to the well-being of their families and communities.Actively promote the interdependence of the generations (Generations United, 2023a).Encourage federal policymakers.One of the most valuable assets you have is your vote. As a constituent, your elected officials know they need your support and will listen to you. Use your voice to help them understand smart investments in people of one generation reap benefits for those in other generations in the form of a stronger workforce and by ensuring quality of life and well-being. They will make America more competitive and help achieve fiscal sustainability. If we neglect thoughtful investments across the lifespan and abandon support for the growing interdependence of generations, we risk failure in the form of wasteful spending, increased public divisiveness, and policies injurious to American families and communities.A good example of where to begin is by encouraging your representatives to support appropriating funds for intergenerational shared sites and multigenerational services projects authorized in the 2020 Older Americans Act through the Grant Program for Multigenerational Collaboration and support the 2024 reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, with increased supports for intergenerational shared sites and programs (Generations United, 2023a).Encourage the proliferation of intergenerational shared sites and spaces.Licensing, codes, regulations, and funding streams often stymie the development of shared sites. Tenacious visionaries find ways around the roadblocks but many others are disheartened and give up on their dreams to engage young and old under one roof or in a single outdoor space. We need to elevate and emulate the proven models and identify champions who can help.Encourage funders to weave their priorities.Community and family foundations can promote intergenerational integration by incorporating language that gives preference to potential grantees who propose to leverage the strengths of each generation. For example, years ago a local foundation in Florida offered a limited amount of funding for programs that served young or old and double that amount if the prospective grantee proposed to serve or engage more than one generation. Their request for proposals became a pathway to encourage intergenerational solutions (Generations United, 2008).The St. Davids Foundation in Austin, TX, took a deeper dive and developed a funding stream for intergenerational programs (St. Davids Foundation, 2023). Wanting to expand beyond serving older adults in need, under the leadership of Andrew Levack, St. Davids Foundation started with training for its grantees and potential grantees that included teaching the elements of quality programing and providing access to program development tools. Once funded, the foundation began to build a learning community among its grantees and provided individual technical assistance as they implemented or expanded their programs.Expand your social circle.Change begins with individuals. The belonging survey and Generations United/The Eisner Foundation surveys found a deep desire to connect with others but a helplessness when it came to how. Dont wait for an invitation, make your way. It doesnt need to be a formal intergenerational program. Examples include book clubs, service projects, community fairs, attending school sporting events or theatre, hosting baby showers for military families, providing transportation for students or seniors, tutoring new immigrants as they prepare for citizenship tests, and so much more. Connecting across a shared interest helps bridge the divide more quickly. Start with a baby step. Youll soon learn its worth the effort.Donna M.

Examples are provided from the existing literature on productive activities while highlighting challenges (ageism, racism, and culture) and recommendations for cultivating equity and justice opportunities in productive activity engagement.Key Words:Asian and Asian American, productive aging, ageism, racism, culture, Asian Critical TheoryDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian and Asian American (A/AA) communities experienced heightened racism. Between March 2020 and March 2022 in the United States, among the ethnic groups reporting hate incidents (n= 11,467), Chinese had the highest percentage, followed by Koreans (16%), Filipinos (9%), Japanese (8%), and Vietnamese (8%; Stop AAPI Hate, 2022). A/AAs reported that they were more stressed by experiences of racism than by the COVID-19 pandemic, and experiences of racism were associated with negative mental health conditions (Hahm et al., 2021, as cited in Stop AAPI Hate, 2021; Saw et al., 2021).A/AA older adults were targets of hate crimes, too. A 2021 survey found that 98% of A/AA adults ages 60 and older who reported hate incidents perceived that the United States had become physically dangerous for A/AAs (Stop AAPI Hate, 2022). On top of that, older A/AA women represented an even higher percentage of reported hate incidents than older A/AA men (Takamura et al., 2022). However, A/AA communities are less likely to seek support due to cultural barriers and fear of racism (Stop AAPI Hate, 2021).Productive activities are defined as paid or unpaid activities performed by older people that can contribute to the greater society (Bass et al., 1993, as cited in Gonzales et al., 2015). Such heightened discrimination against this population has made it much more challenging for A/AA older adults to remain productively engaged in work, volunteering, and caregiving. Yet, there is very little literature comprehensively examining these experiences. This article focuses on these experiences and how they relate to the challenges and strategies of productive aging for A/AA older adults.Although the present article will focus on examples of some A/AA subgroups, the author acknowledges that there are other communities experiencing injustice, such as the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) communities. The author also recognizes that NHPI communities have diverse and unique historical experiences that shape their lived experiences and activity engagement, as discussed in my other studies (Lee et al., 2023). The author recognizes that it will not be possible to discuss all A/AA cultures and diverse experiences in this article.Asian Critical (AsianCrit) TheoryAlthough most productive aging literature has used various theoretical perspectives, no study has fully integrated AsianCrit Theory with the productive aging perspective when focusing on A/AA older adults.AsianCrit Theory offers the following seven tenets to help understand the lived experiences of A/AAs:AsianizationTransnational contexts(Re)constructive historyStrategic (anti)essentialismIntersectionalityStory, theory, and praxisSocial justiceAsianization, transnational contexts, and (re)constructive history are tenets reflected in Critical Race Theory (Iftikar & Museus, 2018). Intersectionality, story, theory and praxis, and social justice help in understanding the impact of White supremacy on A/AA experiences. AsianCrit is useful in analyzing issues of oppression toward achieving an equitable and free society.Utilizing AsianCrit can help create culturally appropriate productive activity opportunities for the A/AA older adult population.WorkThe following section on work is particularly relevant to these tenets from AsianCrit Theory: Asianization (i.e., the impact of White Supremacy and racism resulting in stereotypes), transnational contexts (i.e., focus on how previous and current global economic, political, and social experiences), (re)constructive history (i.e., the invisibility and silence), and social justice (i.e., efforts to eradicate oppression) (Iftikar & Museus, 2018).Recent studies exemplify how A/AAs experienced increased challenges in their engagement with work during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, A/AAs with lower education levels were more likely to lose employment compared to their White counterparts (Kim et al., 2021). A/AAs also found it difficult to regain employment (Kim et al., 2021).Ageism as a Barrier to Engaging in WorkA large proportion of older A/AA immigrant healthcare workers experienced ageism and other forms of discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic (Ma et al., 2021; Takamura et al., 2022). Following the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, some Asian subpopulations came to the United States to work in frontline service occupations (Ma et al., 2021). This trend had significant implications during the COVID-19 pandemic: at that time, about 21% of AAPI workers ages 55 and older worked in service occupations, which is about 6% higher than for the overall U.S. population (Ma et al., 2021).At a policy level, employment rights and anti-discrimination laws should be widely disseminated to employers and employees.Despite providing important care and essential services to the public (Lee & Blacher, 2013; Ma et al., 2021), older A/AA workers faced heightened discrimination and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, it was an extremely difficult time for older adults as they faced greater ageist narratives from society and in the workplace, and even more onerous for A/AA older workers as they faced anti-Asian rhetoric on top of increased ageism.Racism as a Barrier to Engaging in WorkHistorically, Asian immigrants came to the United States for various work opportunities and played a significant role in economic and social development. Hmong refugees have engaged in agricultural activities (Tsu et al., 2017), and immigrants from India have worked in the agriculture, lumber, and railroad industries (Hanna & Batalova, 2020).One notable example of discrimination against Asian immigrant workers in the United States was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which prohibited Chinese laborers from immigrating and barred Chinese immigrants from obtaining U.S. citizenship (United States National Archives, 2023). With the perception that Chinese immigrants took away employment opportunities from White people, they became the targets of hate crimes. In 1885, Chinese miners in Wyoming were murdered by their White coworkers in what became known as the Rock Springs Massacre. The brutality of this event showed how Chinese workers became scapegoats for societal challenges.More recently, negative employment and workplace experiences have been reported among A/AAs (Shang et al., 2021). Increased experiences of racial microaggressions during the COVID-19 pandemic were documented by healthcare workers of Asian descent (Shang et al., 2021). They have experienced microaggressions from various groups (e.g., the public and patients), including being asked about ethnic origin, experiencing direct avoidance, and receiving explicit racial profanities (Shang et al., 2021). A/AAs were attacked at work via negative verbal messages (e.g., being called COVID-19) and received death threats because of their race (Toh et al., 2021).RecommendationsAgeism and racism have prevented older A/AA workers from equal and just work opportunities and environments. Support groups and mental health services for older A/AA workers that are culturally appropriate could help them navigate the process of properly responding to workplace discrimination or unfair employment opportunities. At a policy level, employment rights and anti-discrimination laws should be widely disseminated to employers and employees. Reflecting on their history of invisibility and silence, various stakeholders (e.g., community organizations, policymakers, and researchers) should collaborate to develop ways to help A/AA older adults be perceived as valued contributors to society through equal work opportunities.VolunteeringThe following section on volunteering is particularly relevant to the intersectionality tenet of AsianCrit Theory. Formal volunteering is defined as an unpaid or minimally compensated activity to provide support through a formal organization. Informal volunteering is defined as providing help outside of a formal organization (Morrow-Howell, 2010).There is a lack of research focusing on culturally and linguistically diverse older adults, such as A/AA older adults, and volunteerism in the United States. There are even fewer studies focusing on A/AA subgroup differences and volunteerism (Sundeen et al., 2007). Although this article presents limited examples from some A/AA subgroups, more studies are needed to understand how diverse A/AA older adults are engaged in volunteering and to identify the unique needs of each group.For instance, several studies examining volunteerism among East Asian older adults in the United States have found that Chinese immigrant older adults gain health benefits through their volunteering experiences. However, it is important to note that people with better English language proficiency, higher education, and better self-perceived health had higher odds of volunteering (Lee et al., 2018; Mui et al., 2013). Similarly, among older Korean immigrants, limited English proficiency and a lack of information about formal organizations were found to be barriers to participating in formal volunteering (Chang, 2022).There are limited studies on other groups of A/AA older adults, especially South Asians and Southeast Asians in the United States. Despite the benefits of volunteering, the lack of empirical evidence on diverse A/AA volunteering experiences makes it difficult to identify the mechanisms to promote their volunteering engagement.Barriers to VolunteerismAccording to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (2016), Asians had a lower volunteering rate (17.9%) compared to White (26.4%) and Black (19.3%) Americans. Yet, there are limited studies on volunteerism among A/AA older adults. Issues of diversity, such as cultural and ethnic characteristics, can be associated with civic activity engagement. Engagement mechanisms for meaningful participation in volunteering opportunities include promoting a co-producing volunteering environment and developing a sense of belonging (Lu et al., 2023). The absence of such mechanisms can be a barrier to cultivating a culture of volunteering among Asian immigrant older adults in the United States, whose cultural backgrounds may lead to a different understanding of volunteering and who may have limited English proficiency.The COVID-19 pandemic and the heightened anti-Asian racism it brought cast older A/AA older adults aside by making it even more challenging for them to participate in meaningful, productive activities.Moreover, older immigrants, racial-ethnic minorities, and low-income older adults encounter greater barriers to participation in volunteering programs as they often are not aware of these programs (Foster-Bey, 2008; Gonzales et al., 2015; Lai et al., 2021). Furthermore, there were more older A/AA women spending time volunteering than older A/AA men. Volunteering barriers for A/AA older adults were related to their intersectionality, yet society has no supportive infrastructure through which to engage them.RecommendationsAt a practice level, it is important to collaborate with various ethnic enclaves to mobilize volunteers and promote various engagement opportunities within the community. As English proficiency was identified as a barrier to volunteering, working with ethnic enclaves and ethnic-specific volunteering organizations can encourage A/AA older adults to volunteer. At a policy level, it is critical to strengthen access to volunteering infrastructure by providing volunteering information in multiple languages, providing transportation support, and incentivizing community organizations to hire employees who can speak multiple languages. Diverse immigrant older adults want to serve the community, yet studies on such volunteerism among older immigrants are limited. More research is needed to understand the needs, challenges, and patterns of volunteerism among A/AA older adults.CaregivingThe following section on caregiving is particularly relevant to the intersectionality and the strategic (anti)essentialism (i.e., White supremacy racializes AAs as a monolithic group) tenets of AsianCrit Theory (Iftikar & Museus, 2018).Formal caregiving, defined as helping a person in need through paid professional care services, and informal caregiving, defined as unpaid care often through personal and social networks, have been important ways of supporting older adults and their family members in some cultures (Li & Song, 2019). Immigrants from places where cultural values emphasize respect toward older adults may perceive greater ageism and discrimination when they move to the United States, resulting in conflicts in caregiving roles and expectations.Barriers to CaregivingAlthough A/AA caregiver subgroups were not disaggregated, it was found that A/AA caregivers generally are engaged in work while taking care of others for about 36.7 hours per week. They also are engaged in stressful caregiving activities compared to Black or Hispanic caregivers. Their well-being is at risk as they feel a great responsibility to care for others but use less formal support than non-Hispanic White caregivers (National Alliance for Caregiving & AARP, 2020).In addition to the caregiving burden, some A/AA caregivers have difficulties acculturating. For instance, Japanese American caregivers face challenges as caregiving values change, more women work outside the home, and family structure evolves (Mokuau & Tomioka, 2010). Less acculturated Filipino-American grandparents encounter parenting and health challenges (Kataoka-Yahiro et al., 2004).Furthermore, studies have reported that caregivers and older adults experience ageism and discrimination. For instance, caregivers may experience informational prejudice (i.e., an inability to receive critical information) and encounter a lack of age-related admission policies (e.g., a lack of specific guidelines for hospitalization; Gholamzadeh et al., 2022). The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2022) states that caregiver discrimination violates federal employment discrimination law. However, these laws do not protect people solely based on their caregiver status. Employees who are caregivers may be protected by laws such as the Family and Medical Leave Act.A/AA family caregivers reported facing more challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a study focusing on Korean American older adults and their caregivers, almost a quarter of the participants were fearful for their safety as anti-Asian sentiment increased (Han et al., 2023).RecommendationsTo alleviate the stress and other mental health consequences of the discrimination mentioned above, offering caregiver training opportunities in multiple languages would be important for diverse A/AA subgroups. Addressing cultural barriers, language limitations, limited culturally appropriate services, and a lack of education/information are important in serving A/AA families. Policy-level support to promote community outreach and education collaboration with specific ethnic enclaves for caregiver support is important. Researchers can inform caregiving services by examining how different A/AA subgroup cultures influence their caregiving practices. Although A/AAs have often been viewed as a monolithic group, it is critical to identify the unique needs and areas of caregiving support for each subgroup. Scholars and advocacy groups can engage A/AA representatives in coalition-building and scientific advancement in this area by studying A/AA caregivers who have intersecting identities.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic and the heightened anti-Asian racism it brought cast A/AA older adults aside by making it even more challenging for them to participate in meaningful, productive activities. Systemic and societal efforts would be important in: recognizing the diversity and heterogeneity among A/AA older adults in their productive activity engagement experiences; developing educational opportunities to understand the history and challenges/strengths of A/AA older adults; promoting positive rhetoric on the identities of A/AA older adults; and committing to providing culturally relevant productive activity engagement opportunities.Informed by AsianCrit Theory, policymakers, practitioners, educators, researchers, and other stakeholders can collaborate in acknowledging the collective challenges of the A/AA communities while developing long-term goals to support the diverse A/AA subgroups and to respect their cultures. Promoting panethnic advocacy work while providing culturally relevant productive activities can help to eliminate the barriers that A/AA older adults have been facing. The increased visibility of injustice during the pandemic motivates us to cultivate opportunities to create equitable, productive engagement for all in later life.Yeonjung Jane Lee, PhD, is an MSW gerontological specialization chair and assistant professor at the Thompson School of Social Work & Public Health University of Hawaii at Mnoa.Photo credit: Shutterstock/PitukTVReferencesChang, M.

Advances in technology and medicine have allowed older workers to remain in the workforce longer, even as older workers continue to be challenged with chronic illness, mental distress (e.g., anxiety and depression), and fallout from COVID-19. In this article we discuss how understanding the various and interconnected ways in which our social identities enable or constrain our livesalso called using an intersectional lenswill help promote long, healthy, and productive lives for everyone.Key Words:intersectionality, employment, volunteerism, caregiving, care work, racial and ethnic disparities, inequity, health, retirementA Day in the Life of Ms. SarahToday is Ms. Sarahs 69th birthday. Her coworkers at the grocery store where she has worked as a cashier since she was 22 gave her a small party in the breakroom with a white cake that had Happy Birthday Ms. Sarah! written in big red letters. After her morning shift, she raced to her grandsons high school to pick him up. Ms. Sarah has cared for her grandson since he was 6, and his mother was incarcerated for drug possession. Ms. Sarah has to pick him up because he has been banned from the afternoon school bus for fighting. She knows her grandson is being bullied because of his ADHD and psychological therapy sessions at school, so she doesnt mind spending a bit of extra time with him on their ride home through the city.On the way home, Ms. Sarah stops at the local pharmacy to pick up blood thinners for Margaret, her common-law spouse of 15 years, who 6 months ago had a stroke. The medicine costs $35.33; $4 more than it did last month. Ms. Sarah panics at first as she only could scrounge up exact change when she left the house this morning. Then she remembers her coworkers gave her a $25 gift card as a birthday gift. She uses it to pay for the medicine and grabs her grandsons favorite candy bar as a treat for having passed his math exam today. As she heads to the exit, passing the COVID-19 home tests, she says a little prayer of thankfulness that she has recovered from COVID-19 twice and had enough money to pay for Margarets medicine. Ms. Sarah then rushes out the door. She wants to be on time to relieve the home health aide of her shift and start dinner and Margarets evening care routine.Ms. Sarah identities as a grandmother, spouse, cashier, caretaker, Black woman, lesbian, and COVID-19 survivor. These seven characteristics could be those of seven different people or just one. Though a fictional character developed for the purposes of this article, she is not unlike many of the older workers we have heard from in our research on older workers and caregivers across the years.Ms. Sarahs life demonstrates the diversity and complexities of everyday people in America who are seeking a healthy and productive life full of family, financial security, and affordable healthcare. When it comes to addressing health disparities for working older adults, how do we as policymakers, practitioners, researchers, and society ensure that we consider all aspects that make older workers who they are, so we can design policies, programs, and institutions that support human flourishing?In the United States, older Black women are more likely to work in low-wage essential jobs that increase their chances of exposure to COVID-19, because they work in close daily contact with the public (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020). According to the CDC (2022), Black Americans were hospitalized from COVID-19 at 2.1 times the rate of White Americans.Sarahs life is shaped by cultural norms intersecting with her sex, relationship status, health status, job, income, and geographic location.People in low-wage jobs who are racialized minorities also typically lack access to quality healthcare (Ray et al., 2021), and even those with good jobs often cannot claim same-sex dependents on their company insurance policies (Gonzales, 2014). Finally, even as Black Americans have more chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis, Black grandmothers are more likely to have primary custody of their grandchildren (Smith-Ruiz & Jason, 2021) than their White counterparts, as they manage their declining health.Ms. Sarahs life, like everyones, is shaped by cultural norms intersecting with her sex, relationship status, health status, job, income, and geographic location, among other factors. To understand her life, the choices she makes, and the opportunities and barriers she navigates, we must use an intersectional perspective or what is more commonly known as intersectionality.Why Intersectionality, Now?Intersectionality was introduced in the late 1980s by legal scholar Kimberl Crenshaw (1989). It describes the overlapping and intersecting social identities (e.g., race, gender, education, ability, sexuality, gender identity, socioeconomic status) that often affect and inform how we navigate society. Some identities garner privilege and power, while others assign us to lives of oppression and marginalization. Crenshaw argues that individuals identities are not mutually exclusive and that we must look at their intersections to understand where inequities lie and to better inform solutions. The question is: how does intersectionality help us make sense in 2024 of health and work options as people age into later lives?Social inequalities over the life course have always shaped later-life opportunities and outcomes in important ways. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, we have seen major changes in whether and how older adults engage with and experience paid employment, as well as other forms of unpaid labor, such as care work (which can include caregiving for dependent children or adults, as well as other domestic tasks like housework, food preparation, and emotional labor provided to families or kin; Perry-Jenkins & Gerstel, 2020; Xue & McMunn, 2021) and formal and informal helping within communities.Simultaneously, we have seen shifts in our collective understanding of how structural factors and multiple sources of oppression (e.g., ageism, ableism, racism, and other isms based on marginalized social identities) intersect to constrain choice and opportunity over the life course to produce health and economic inequities. Research and discourse on paid and unpaid work in later life have not always captured (and have sometimes mischaracterized) the variety and complexity of lived experiences in later lifeespecially for low-income workers, workers of color, women, and others marginalized due to their social position (Matz & Brown, 2021).Statistics often obscure how the most marginalized older workers are faring. Dominant narratives emphasize individual agency and choice, depicting successful or productive agers as those who make good choices to secure their health and well-being, employment security, and pension and welfare provision in later life. However, such approaches ignore the variety of socioeconomic, structural, historical, and cultural factors contributing to unfair workplace practices, lack of care structures, poor health, heightened stress, early retirement, and employment/retirement insecurity.More research is necessary to gain a better understanding of the social contexts and environments that support choice and opportunity in later life when it comes to work, retirement, care work, and community engagement, especially in a post-COVID world. Here we challenge readers to apply an intersectional lens to better understand how multiple marginalized identities come together to cumulatively shape later life choices and opportunities and, ultimately shorten health- and life-spans.The Evolution and Application of IntersectionalityWhen Crenshaw (1989) coined the term intersectionality, she did so to highlight the dual marginality of Black women and their lived experiences; thus, intersectionality is a Black feminist framework that centers Black women and explores racialized inequalities and their consequences of oppression as a result of race and gender. Although it was introduced in response to the exclusion of Black thought in social science and to center the experiences of Black women, it has since evolved into a generalized framework to understand the multiplicative, complex, compounding, and intersecting identities (e.g., race, class, gender) and discriminatory social structures (e.g., racism, classism, sexism) that shape the lives of all individuals, and has been used to explain the experiences and life outcomes of all populations (Crenshaw, 1991).The productive aging paradigm considers paid and unpaid forms of work.Intersectionality provides background and a framework for comprehending power and privilege and the linkages of numerous systems of exploitation and domination operating at the structural level, and acknowledges how oppressive systems are mutually dependent in their reinforcement of inequality (Collins & Bilge, 2020). Since its introduction nearly 40 years ago, intersectionality has gone from the obscurebeing used exclusively by academicsto being a common term in pop culture. For instance, Ashton Applewhite, an anti-ageism activist and influencer and TED Talk speaker, uses her platform to include age and ageism in the conversation about intersectionality.Unpacking Intersectionality in Health and Work in Later LifeThe rapid growth of the older adult population has increasingly highlighted the importance of social and productive engagement in promoting the health and well-being of older adults. The productive aging paradigm considers both paid and unpaid forms of work, as it is important to acknowledge and understand other forms of labor in which older adults are often engaged, but that tend to come without a paycheck and to be undervalued. For instance, caregivingwhether for grandchildren or for an ill or disabled spouse or parentas well as volunteerism and other forms of helping within communities. Learning and education in later life is also part of this picture, as education in many countries has tended to be designed and structured for younger adults, restricting pathways for midlife and older adults in important ways.The global pandemic has only highlighted how vital or how harmful such engagement can be for health and well-being, depending upon the quality of the environments in these roles and how they complement or compete with one another. Further, socioeconomic, structural, historical, and cultural factors can affect access to and participation in such activities as well as the extent to which positive (or negative) outcomes are derived.According to Wrigley-Fields estimates in 2020, if we look at life expectancy by race, we see that the highest-ever Black life expectancy (in 2014) equaled White life expectancy levels from 1989. While this authors figures show that Black life expectancy was also increasing during that time, there are some significant race-based gaps here. If we consider the intersection of race, gender, and social class, we see even more evidence that social inequalities over the life course shape later-life opportunities and outcomes in important ways. Olshansky and colleagues (2012) estimated that Black men with less than a high school education have a life expectancy that is about 20 years lower than the life expectancy of highly educated White women.Crenshaw offers a simple analogy of an intersection as a frame. Lets take Ms. Sarah. The roads to the intersection in this case would be the way that the workforce is structured by age and by race. Then the traffic on those roads would be the hiring policies and the other practices that travel on those roads. So, Ms. Sarah is positioned precisely where the age and race roads overlap, experiencing the simultaneous impact of the companys age and race traffic.Many of our institutions, polices, and practices are set up to address harms Ms. Sarah might experience on the age road or the race road, but what happens when you are experiencing both? What if there were a third road at play? A fourth? Often in these situations, what you find is that folks are being impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for themselves. Using an intersectional lens allows us to see and address such issues and sheds light on the structural factors that are responsible. Structural and institutional racism, ageism, poverty, and other forms of oppression deeply ingrained in institutions trickle down to affect individual outcomes.Part of what applying an intersectional lens looks like in practice is not only identifying where inequities lie, but also giving voice to/centering those, much like Ms. Sarah, who are the most proximal to the inequity when proposing and implementing solutions. We want to elevate the experiences and lives of those who exist outside of socially constructed dominate spaces. For instance, women and people who identify as trans often are marginalized in male-dominated spaces. People of color often are marginalized in White-dominated spaces. People who have disabilities and sexual minorities often are marginalized in able-bodied and heterosexual spaces. In many mixed group settings, such as workplaces, people with dominate identity statuses often overlook the needs and perspectives of others. This is what makes intersectionality useful.Call to Action for New Solutions and ApproachesAll people should have the right to choice and opportunity when it comes to work/retirement, care work, community engagement, and learning across the life course, particularly later in life. It is through such roles and aspects of our identity that we derive a sense of meaning and purpose, which is critical to quality of life. We also know, however, that race, birthplace, social and economic class, and additional layers of being othered impact the choices and opportunities available. When multiple marginalized identities (e.g., being gay and Black, being working-class, etc.) intersect with ageism, untold numbers of constrained choices accumulate over a lifetime, driving increasing distance between the privileged and the marginalized on a variety of life outcomesincluding health and life expectancy.We want to elevate the experiences and lives of those who exist outside of socially constructed dominate spaces.Now is the time to act on this front. Portraying the experiences of older adults holistically is important to advancing this area of scholarship and changing institutions, infrastructure, policies, and programs to support our aging population. What is most critical, though, is ensuring we approach this work with intentionality and purpose. We need to have representation on research teams, in workplaces (e.g., boards of directors, human resources, etc.), community settings (e.g., advisory boards), and in policy discussions of older workers across various identities. We need to ask, before we do a study, develop a program, or write a policy: which workers would benefit, who is represented, and who is left out? (SeeMorrow-Howell,Halvorsen, andLeein this issue for more on work and older adults.)We cannot address age inequities without looking deeply at other ismssuch as racism, classism, and ableism. This has to be central to our work. One way to do this is to give voice to those who are nearest to inequityand to listen to these voices when proposing and implementing solutions. This is our call to action.In offering this call to action, we propose that readers consider new solutions and approaches in each of four action domains: work environments and employment policies, caregiving and other forms of care work, diverse opportunities to give back to others and to engage socially, and age-friendly educational institutions (Gonzales, et al., 2022; Morrow-Howell et al., 2018). These four domains represent several pathways to action that may serve to advance long, healthy, and productive lives for everyone. This, of course, is not a comprehensive road map of action domains that we might move toward, but instead serves to provide broad guideposts for action. It can compel us to first ask, what is the vision/goal here? Perhaps it is a world where:Work environments and employment policies enable all people (regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, immigration status, etc.) to obtain and maintain good, quality work across the lifespan, to work longer if needed or desired, and to enjoy a comfortable retirement.Caregiving and other forms of care work are properly supported across the lifespan and in later life particularly, so that individuals and families have increased control and choice and reduced stress.Diverse opportunities exist across the lifespan for individuals to give back to others, to their communities, and to engage socially.Educational institutions are restructured to be accessible and inclusive so that individuals can develop new knowledge and skills across the life course (Gonzales et al., 2022; Morrow-Howell et al., 2018).None of this is possible without first dismantling structural racism and other ingrained systems of inequity and interrogating the assumptions that shape access to choice and opportunity across the life course and in later life.This call to action compels us to ask questions about inequities that exist, where they exist, and what is their root cause. It asks us to seek understanding from those who are closest to inequity, those who are at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities to inform solutions. It is only through such an intersectional lens that we will be able to identify where our institutions, infrastructures, policies and programs are inequitable and to elevate the experiences and lives of those who exist outside of socially constructed dominate spaces to advance long, healthy, and productive lives for everyone. Because if we can unearth the inequities and redesign institutions and systems to work for the most marginalized among usthose like Sarah, who live at the intersection of many marginalized identitiesall of us will be better served.Kendra Jason, PhD, is an associate professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

Resolving structural inequities endured by Indigenous peoples across the lifespan using existing policy mechanisms will only be possible if we better develop our theoretical frameworks to include Indigenous perspectives and develop research agendas that center minoritized aging populations. We illustrate this approach by proposing modifications to Title VI of the Older Americans Act and the Indian Healthcare Improvement Act.Key Words:Indigenous, health equity, structural determinants of health, health policyGerontology has recently shifted attention to the development of research that not only includes, but centers, older adults who are minoritized on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender sexuality, as well as other marginalized identities. As an Indigenous scholar, I frequently find myself asking: how often are gerontologists thinking about the I in BIPOC? Historically, Indigenous Older Adults (IOAs) have been conspicuously absent from research, interventions, and policies, and they remain marginalized from these spheres today.Despite this lack of attention, Indigenous communities in the United States have a larger number of older adults than at any other time in the last century. Estimates suggest that by 2060 the population of Native Americans and Alaska Natives will more than double (Administration on Aging, 2020). One likely outcome of this trend will be a disproportionate increase in the number of IOAs living with multiple chronic conditions, functional limitations, and dementias. Unfortunately, critical deficiencies in our knowledge about the health and historical context of the older Indigenous population, theories that guide our research, and policies designed to support Indigenous elders may create new challenges for aging Indigenous communities.Indigenous communities also have important strengths that could be leveraged to amplify the impact of future interventions. In this article, I explore the relationship between historical trauma, intergenerational stress, and protective factors like informal support and community activity among Indigenous Americans. I then discuss integrating health equity, productive aging, and Gero-Indigenous theories and propose an example of how modifications to existing U.S. policy informed by this context can support the development of community-centered research and interventions in Indigenous communities.Historical Origins of Contemporary Health InequitiesIndigenous peoples in the United States are broadly defined under three categories: Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Here I focus on the Native American and Alaska Native populations in recognition of the distinct cultural, geographic, and political context of Native Hawaiians. Beginning in the 18th century, government policies facilitated the extermination or relocation of the majority of Indigenous peoples in the United States. Many tribes were confined to low-resource, rural reservations that limited access to equitable employment, education, and healthcare infrastructures. These acts of structural violence were reinforced by cultural assimilation programs, such as state-sponsored religious/residential schools, that worked to dismantle Indigenous religions, languages, and cultural practices and replace them with European equivalents (Treuer, 2019).In the most recent U.S. Census, about 5.2 million people identified as Native Americans or Alaska Natives, and 2.9 million claimed only a single Indigenous racial/ethnic identity. This represents just less than 2% of the total U.S. population (Administration on Aging, 2020).Indigenous elders report higher levels of perceived racial discrimination in healthcare settings than do White residents.There are 573 federally recognized tribal nations in the continental United States and Alaska. Tribal status, and access to the rights and benefits associated with membership in a tribal nation, are granted under criteria established by each tribal nation. About half of all Native Americans and Alaska Natives live off of reservations (National Congress of American Indians, 2019).After four centuries of trauma, cultural extermination, and physical marginalization, inequities in wealth and health between Indigenous and White populations remain apparent today. Indigenous people in the United States have lower levels of educational attainment and experience lower quality education than do White U.S. residents (Woods, 2020). They also are likely to live in or near poverty. As of 2021, 26% of Indigenous households in the United States lived below the federal poverty line, more than double the proportion of White people living in poverty (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2022). IOAs also report higher levels of perceived racial discrimination in healthcare settings than do White residents (Stepanikova & Oates, 2017).My work with data from the Health and Retirement Study paints a similar picture of inequities in multiple domains (see Figure 1, below). Using data collected between 2006 and 2020, I found that 39% of IOAs have less than a high school education, 33% have annual incomes in the lowest quartile of the sample, 35% experienced interpersonal discrimination events a few times per month or more, and 21% reported having a psychiatric diagnosis. This context suggests that IOAs, like Black older adults, may be at increased risk of developing health issues earlier in life (Ferraro & Shippee, 2009).However, these data also paint a picture of IOAs as strongly engaged with their communities. More than half of Indigenous elders in this sample reported engaging in any informal volunteering in the previous year and a quarter were engaged in formal volunteering activities. These rates of informal volunteerism may even be underestimates of social contributions from IOAs given that community involvement is seen as a core component of life in many Native communities (Estes et al., 2023).Given this context of structural disadvantage, IOAs predictably report high rates of chronic health conditions in later life. Relative to the general population, they have higher rates of diabetes (Acton et al., 2003), obesity, cardiovascular diseases (Hutchinson & Shin, 2014), depression (Browne et al., 2017), and alcohol abuse (Cobb et al., 2014). The prevalence of these diseases suggests that IOAs experience high levels of chronic stress across the lifespan that may put them at special risk for developing age-related chronic conditions, like dementias (Cooper et al., 2015). Given the troubling context of lifespan stressors among IOAs, it is no surprise that they are at risk for accelerated aging processes and mental health issues.Pervasive inequities in the domains of wealth and health combine to multiplicatively impact the lives of Indigenous Americans and often shape the ways that they die. The National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) recent estimates on life expectancies illuminated a trend that those of us involved in Indigenous health research both anticipated and feared. The life expectancy of Native Americans and Alaska Natives decreased by 6.6 years between 2019 and 2021 during the COVID pandemic (Arias et al., 2022).This COVID-19driven drop in life expectancy wiped out more than 30 years of progress toward closing the gap between Indigenous life expectancies and those of the general population. While COVID-19 accounted for 21.4% of the 6.6-year decline in life expectancy among Indigenous Americans, other modifiable risk factors such as unintentional injuries (21.3%), liver diseases (18.6%), suicide (5.4%), and heart diseases (3.4%) accounted for a large proportion of their declining life expectancies.Whether Indigenous Americans died due to COVID-19, were sex-trafficked or murdered (Bureau of Indian Affairs, n.d.), overdosed on opiates (Joshi et al., 2018), or took their own lives (Murphy et al., 2020), it is clear that the United States as a society has failed to respond to the critical health and safety needs of Indigenous Americans.Engaging in activities that contribute economically to society can act protectively to preserve multiple domains of health in later life.However, despite the overwhelming force of structural disadvantages leaning on Indigenous communities, we also have important evidence of strength and resilience. For example, in an analysis of post-stroke subjective decline Burns et al. (2019) found that IOAs reported extremely high levels of perceived access to social support relative to all other groups. Fully 99.1% of all IOA respondents reported being able to always, usually, or sometimes get help when confusion or memory loss interfered with their ability to perform day-to-day activities.Strong perceptions of community membership may be related to informal volunteering among IOAs, but no U.S. studies to date have applied productive aging frameworks to the lives of Indigenous older adults. A recent Canadian scoping review (Viscogliosi et al., 2020) of formal and grey literature on intergenerational solidarity in Indigenous communities found that the social participation of Indigenous elders was primarily organized around interpersonal relationships and engagement in intergenerational civic activities, such as shared teaching activities (e.g., elders teaching Indigenous knowledge practices to young people, young people teaching elders about technology).It also found that these informal forms of civic engagement contributed to multiple domains of well-being across generations. Despite inattention from gerontologists in the United States, many tribes and urban Indigenous organizations already are investing in the development of intergenerational programs to support at-risk youth and elders (Kahn et al., 2016), and it is imperative that researchers advocate for increased federal and state financial support for these programs.Integrating Health Equity, Productive Aging, and Critical Gero-Indigenous FrameworksA positivistic research philosophy undergirds many scientific methods today and emphasizes the importance of objective, distant measurement by an unbiased researcher. As a product of this perspective, the notion of a single truth established by the dominant cultural group is privileged above alternative forms of knowledge, including Indigenous land practices and storytelling. Health equity frameworks are not immune to this bias. Historically, policymakers and researchers discussed differences in health using the language of health disparities. The term disparity was intended to indicate a particular type of variation in health between groupsbetween the socially advantaged and the socially disadvantaged (Braveman, 2006). A health equity lens integrates a social-justice perspective into the framework of public health. One consequence of state-sponsored oppression (and extermination) of Indigenous communities was the exclusion of Indigenous perspectives from much of scientific history.Investigations into Indigenous volunteerism also suggest that we will have to adapt productive aging frameworks to our work with these communities. Productive aging frameworks contend that engaging in activities that contribute economically to society can act protectively to preserve multiple domains of health in later life (Gonzales et al., 2015), but existing operationalizations of volunteerism are likely not effectively capturing forms of community engagement like hunting and gathering, spiritual and traditional activities, and Elderhood (Estes et al., 2023). To avoid the reproduction of post-colonial inequities, we as gerontologists must critique the ways that our methods for creating new knowledge might unintentionally alienate those who can benefit most from that knowledge.Increasing Indigenous engagement with, and willingness to participate in, population-level research will be critical for researchers, practitioners, and IOAs in the decades to come. Shifting away from positivistic and toward decolonizing perspectives on knowledge may help researchers build buy-in from Indigenous communities and foster increased trust in large-scale research. Braun and colleagues (2014) suggest that the following strategies be integrated into all levels of research conducted with Indigenous persons whenever possible: 1) Collect Indigenous data in partnership with Indigenous organizations; 2) Adapt standardized measurement tools to Indigenous contexts; 3) Integrate qualitative methods; 4) Employ participatory practices; and 5) Use decolonizing, critical, or life-course theoretical perspectives to guide research design. Including these research strategies may help to frame the quality of knowledge produced as valuable to Indigenous communities and better acquaint researchers with the needs of IOA research participants. These methods can also be integrated into policy reform efforts.Using Policy to Drive Innovation in Indigenous Health InterventionsAs a cognitive health researcher, I focus on how structural factors, like socioeconomic inequity and systemic racism, impact the cognitive health of Indigenous older adults in later life. Below I apply integrated health equity, productive aging, and Gero-Indigenous frameworks to illustrate how federal policies can be modified to resolve a critical gap in our knowledge about Alzheimers Disease and Dementias in Indigenous communities: How common are these diseases and do communities have the resources to manage them? An existing federal policy, Title VI of the Older Americans Act, could be used to answer these questions.Amending Title VI of the Older Americans ActThe Older Americans Act (OAA) was signed into law on July 14, 1965, by President Lyndon B. Johnson and was designed to increase funding for community and social services for Older Adults. The OAA provides states with funding proportional to the number of adults ages 60 and older and promotes the ability of older adults to age in place by funding the use of evidence-based preventive services, like Meals on Wheels.The OAA was amended in 1978 with Title VI, a provision designed to fund community services for Indigenous Americans. In fiscal year 2020, about $44 million was budgeted to provide services for Alaskan Natives, American Indians, and Native Hawaiians. Title VI allocates $34 million of this budget toward community, meal, and health-based preventive services for eligible tribal organizations. The remaining $10 million is allocated for Indigenous caregiver support services.While IOAs have been granted a seat at the table for service funding under Title VI, they have been denied equitable funding for research activities.Activists contend that Title VI chronically underfunds services for IOAs (Ujvari et al., 2019). The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI; 2019) consistently requests about 25% more funds than Congress authorizes to provide adequate meal services, legal services, respite care, home health aides, and referral services. A critical oversight in Title VI is the lack of funding for research related to the health and well-being of IOAs.The OAA allocates roughly 3% of its total budget to research and training grants (Ujvari et al., 2019). However, there are no specific earmarks for Indigenous-focused research and supporting a pipeline of Indigenous scholars from high school to post-PhD. While IOAs have been granted a seat at the table for service funding under Title VI, they have been denied equitable funding for research activities. Critical gaps in knowledge about Indigenous health and community engagement are likely to remain entrenched so long as these inequities persist.To address these issues, I suggest that Title VI should be allocated an additional 0.9% of OAAs total budget (~$22M in 2023 dollars). This increase would, for the first time, allow Title VIs program funding goals to be fully met and will improve Indigenous access to stable, consistent, and high-quality community supports. This increase in funding also could fund existing intergenerational programming and greater intergenerational solidarity in Indigenous communities. Without access to stable, tribe-managed social services, it is unlikely that IOAs will be able to achieve any health equity.I also recommend that Title VI be amended to allocate an additional 1% of the annual OAA budget to research focused on IOA health and well-being (~$23M in 2023 dollars). Such funding could be focused on the development of longitudinal health data and research methods that decolonize the collection of such data and leverage Braun et al.s (2014) Gero-Indigenous research design principles. Additionally, by applying methods like mixed-method participatory research, developing community advisory boards, and training Indigenous community members to lead data collection and management efforts, we can develop a better understanding of how Indigenous communities are supporting the civic engagement of elders, and how we can leverage federal dollars to support intergenerational relationships in Indigenous communities.ConclusionIn coming years, Indigenous communities in the United States likely will face new challenges as they age. The United States may be able to moderate the impact of this demographic shift by providing adequate funds for researchers and tribes to develop culturally centered, preventive services and research agendas that reflect the needs and desires of Indigenous communities. The impact of these programs could be augmented by small increases to research funding via Title VI grants that deploy resources to communities to support intergenerational programs, and encourage participatory research to develop community-centered health and community engagement tools validated with IOAs.These proposed changes also have a relatively low sticker price. The total annual budget increase for all the policy recommendations above would fall in the range of $30$40 million annually and could dramatically improve the lives of all IOAs in the country.Some state-level programs, such as the Memory Keepers Medical Discovery Team at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine, already are testing similar methods. Funded by a $60 million grant from the state, this program seeks to close the rural-urban health divide faced by many Indigenous communities by increasing access to care and developing measurement tools that are culturally attuned and validated, and focused on leveraging intergenerational volunteering to support elders aging with dementias.Scaling this type work up to federal policies will enable research and clinical intervention to better understand the health and community engagement of IOAs. As gerontologists invested in responding to the needs of a diverse and growing aging population, we must think creatively about policy mechanisms we can leverage to advance health equity and volunteering initiatives in communities we have failed to support historically.Cliff Whetung is an Ojibwe scholar and PhD Candidate at the Silver School of Social Work at New York University.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Ruslana IurchenkoReferencesActon, K.

Yet this progress matches neither the growth nor potential of the older population. We must focus on ways to optimize older adult engagement in paid and unpaid work roles that are valuable to individuals and society. Ongoing issues remain regarding the lack of inclusion of low-resourced and minoritized populations; as well as ageism. To address ageism, we must center intersectionality, advance anti-ageism interventions at the micro and macro levels, and infuse our conceptual frameworks with concepts that capture age bias to advance knowledge development.Key Words:age stereotype, age bias, age discrimination, intersectionalityFor more than 4 decades, the concept of productive aging has been developing in the gerontology literature. Progress has been made in developing knowledge and greater acknowledgement that engagement is an important part of later life. It has been shown that supporting older adults as workers, volunteers, and caregivers produces positive outcomes for society and individuals. Also, program and policies initiatives have facilitated the productive involvement of older people. Yet such progress is neither commensurate with the growth nor the potential of the older population; and health and socioeconomic disparities in engagement persist into later life. People are beginning to realize that ageism is an underlying problem. This article highlights ongoing challenges related to equity and inclusion and proposes directions to address the problem of ageism more directly.Ongoing Issues: Exclusion of Minoritized Older People and AgeismFrom the earliest discussions about productive aging, scholars and advocates expressed concern over the potential to exploit and marginalize older adults. Moody (1993) discussed the threat of productivity as a goal in later life. He pointed out the danger of extending the societal values of growth, energy, activity, accumulation, and efficacy into the longer life course, advocating instead for a wider vision of later life goals that include altruism, citizenship, stewardship, creativity, and faith. There has been constant concern about the productive-aging framework disadvantaging populations that have been marginalized across the life course. The worry being that efforts to advance productive engagement could extend this exclusion and discrimination further into the life course.Productive-aging advocates recognized these threats and countered with a set of values: inclusion versus elitism; opportunity versus obligation; intergenerational reciprocity versus conflict; and choice versus constraint (Morrow-Howell et al., 2001). With a focus on programs, policies, and social and built environments, the intention of productive aging work was to create and broaden opportunities and facilitate engagement to minimize negative outcomes, not to obligate or burden more. A goal was to enable engagement that increased inclusion and improved the fit of the environment and the demands of the role with individual capacity and preferences (Gonzales et al., 2015). These aims were particularly important to older people in caregiving roles who are unrecognized and under-supported and older workers who need to work longer for financial reasons.Progress toward goals of increasing inclusion and preventing further marginalization has not been obvious. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this lack of progress. We witnessed firsthand how older people, especially older people of color, experienced higher levels of morbidity and mortality; less access to healthcare; and more discrimination in the workplace (Garcia et al., 2021). Across all productive activities, older people experienced heightened levels of challenge. Older workers became unemployed at higher levels than mid-career workers during the pandemic. Reemployment is harder for these older workers, especially for non-White, women, and people without college degrees (Davis et al., 2020). Volunteering and caregiving by older adults were viewed more skeptically, and a paternalistic view led to calls to exclude older people for their own protection (see Acemoglu et al., 2020, for example). The pandemic serves as a stark warning about the vulnerability of marginalized older people in the productive-aging perspective.Gerontologists have long talked about cumulative disadvantage and double/triple jeopardy as people move through the life course. A lifetime of experiencing discrimination based on race, gender, and class produces the disparities we see in health and socioeconomic status. Yet any person who survives into later life, no matter their social positions earlier in the life course, encounters ageism; and age becomes another social identity that adds to the cumulating disadvantages (or perhaps becomes the first disadvantage that those in privileged positions face).Future Directions to Increase Inclusion and Confront AgeismCentering Disparities and Taking an Intersectionality ApproachTo increase inclusion of minoritized and low-resourced people in ongoing productive engagement, scholars should increase knowledge about how disparities relate to engagement and how engagement exacerbates disparities in health and well-being. We may be well-served by infusing concepts from critical race theory (CRT) into productive aging frameworks. CRT promotes several ideas that parallel ageism: the importance of historical analysis and the foundational beliefs that racism is pervasive, systematic; and ingrained within ordinary practices (Blesset & Gaynor, 2021; Delgado & Stefanic, 2017).Further, the concept of interest convergence from CRT is highly applicable to ageism. Interest convergence suggests that powerholders work to advance justice for minoritized people only when it benefits them. Thus, organizations that engage older people in paid and unpaid work will strive to include older people when it is beneficialwhen employers need employees or agencies need volunteers or our society needs caregivers. The interest convergence concept captures a long-standing concern in the productive-aging literaturethat instead of adequately funding/supporting the unpaid work of volunteers and caregivers, we will exploit older adults filling these roles.Clearly, our work in productive aging will be thwarted if we center age to the exclusion of other identities.Intersectionality, a central concept in CRT (Crenshaw, 1991), is critical to advance inclusion and equity in productive aging work. Systems of inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability overlap across a lifetime to create disparities we see in later life. Age by itself may create some vulnerabilities to negative well-being outcomes, but more often, it is the accumulation of minoritized identities that put older people at risk of disadvantage. The COVID-19 pandemic spotlighted intersectionality and illustrated how ageism and racism combined to devalue certain lives (Chan, 2021). Clearly, our work in productive aging will be thwarted if we center age to the exclusion of other identities.Advancing InterventionsThere are national and international efforts to reduce ageism, and productive aging scholars and advocates must support and advance these initiatives. The World Health Organization (2021) and AARP (Jenkins, 2016) provide social media and educational materials to raise awareness about ageism and age discrimination. To the extent that these large-scale efforts reduce age stereotype and age bias more generally, the negative effects of ageism on the productive engagement of older people could be alleviated.The Reframing Aging Initiative, organized by the Gerontological Society of America, seeks to improve the publics understanding of what aging means and the many contributions older people bring to society (https://www.reframingaging.org/). The Reframing Aging initiative highlights the contributions of older adults, societys loss when excluding older adults, and the development of supportive policies and programs. The Reframing Aging initiative embraces the productive aging perspective.Communication strategies advanced by the Reframing Aging initiative call for 1) promoting collective responsibility versus individualism to achieve well-being in later life; 2) increasing awareness about the heterogeneity of the older population; and 3) using positive language about changing demographics and avoiding language that otherizes older people. Productive aging scholars and advocates would be well-served to support implementation, dissemination, and evaluation efforts to change the narrative about later life to include the possibility of vital engagement for the longer life course (Sweetland et al., 2017).In addition to these campaigns to confront ageism, an important piece of legislation has been introduced that could address ageism in the workplace. Although the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 was created in reaction to rampant ageism in the workplace, subsequent rulings weakened its effect and its impact is often minimal. For example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (Lipnik, 2018) found that while the majority of older worker experienced age discrimination in the workplace, only 3% make any type of report. The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (2023), introduced in the Senate, seeks to strengthen the protections so that age can be a contributing and not the primary factor in an age discrimination case. Further, some states are taking action to eliminate dates from employment applications (like birth date or year of college graduation) to reduce age discrimination in the hiring process (An Act Deterring Age Discrimination In Employment Applications, 2021). In sum, efforts must continue on federal and state legislative levels (Gonzales et al., 2021).In addition to legislation, we must seek to intervene at the organizational level. Legislative mandates might not change the behaviors of organizations with age-biased practices, ageist employers, and ageist colleagues. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have grown in organizations, but age does not garner much attention as a diversity factoronly 8% of organizations include age as a part of their diversity and inclusion strategies (Trawinski, n.d.). And although most universities include age as an identity factor in organizational mission statements, there is little programming on campuses to increase age-inclusivity (Morrow-Howell et al., 2022). We must strive to increase awareness and education on age discrimination and the age diversity in employment and educational institutions.In sum, initiatives exist to confront ageism in society and legislative actions to address ageism in employment organizations. There are DEI efforts in organizations, with some activities toward reducing ageism. But we need more action and commitment in all of these arenas. And, there remains a daunting reality that challenges interventions against ageism: ageist attitudes (external and internal) develop over a lifetime; and from early on in our lives, we absorb our societys narrative about age as decline and how later life should be avoided.The challenge is to design, evaluate, and disseminate interventions early in the life course to prevent the development of age biases and ageist attitudes (Gendron, 2022). Although the task is daunting, we must determine how to intervene at early phases of life to ensure that when we all enter later life, we do not experience the barrier of ageism as we pursue productive engagement.Centering Ageism in ResearchProductive aging scholars must elevate ageism in our research agendas and in conceptual and empirical endeavors. First, we must include ageism more squarely in our conceptual frameworks. Different types of age biases are relevant at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, and societal levels. At the society level, we need to capture the existence and effectiveness of federal age-discrimination laws and state policies to elucidate their effects on working. We need to capture the organizational environments where older people work and volunteer to understand the experience and outcomes associated with these productive roles.Similarly, families have expectations based on age stereotypes and age-graded social norms, and internalized ageism affects an older persons assessment of their capacities and preferences. Ageism affects types and levels of engagement in productive roles, the experience in performing those roles, and the outcomes related to this engagement. Yet our theoretical propositions and analytic frames do not capture these contexts and restrict the impact of our research to build understanding and guide interventions.How can employers and work colleagues be legally compliant with age discrimination laws yet continue to be ageist in all phases of the employment cycle?We need to ask research questions directly related to ageism and productive engagement. There are undoubtedly many important questions to advance this scholarship, and I highlight several high priority areas of inquiry. First, we need a deeper understanding about the intersection of age with other marginalizing identities to reduce disparities in productive engagement. We have asked, How do race and age intersect to determine productive aging patterns and outcomes? We have assessed moderating and mediating relationships with age and race variables; and we use secondary data to conduct these analyses. However, the focus is on the individual and this may lead to overly simplistic analyses. It may be more fruitful to think on a more macro, more structural level and ask, How does structural racism contribute to structural ageism, and vice versa?The implementation of legislation at the state and national levels is limited in its effect on age discrimination, as discussed above. We need to understand more about how employers and work colleagues can be legally compliant with age discrimination laws but continue to be ageist in all phases of the employment cycle. We need to develop and test interventions to reduce hiring and promotion biases. How is age being incorporated into organizational DEI practices and how can we introduce age as an identity factor that merits more attention?The powerful effects of internalized ageism on the health of older adults are well-documented (Levy, 2022); but we dont know how internalized ageism affects engagement in productive activities. How do individuals beliefs about aging and their expectations about what they should be doing relate to decisions to engage in activities, the experience of participation, and the outcomes? The same question can be asked about the attitudes of family members whose beliefs and expectations might affect an older persons decision to work, volunteer, or engage in ongoing education. When it comes to caregiving and volunteering, the effects of interpersonal and internalized ageism remain largely unexplored.One of the biggest challenges will be identifying critical points and situations in the life course where interventions toward externalized and internalized ageism have the most effect on later life behavior and outcomes. The methodological challenges are great, but we must know which programs targeted toward youth and younger adults contribute to advancing long and productive lives.Finally, we have long advocated for programs and policies to facilitate older people in working, volunteering, and caregiving roles; and we have long known that implementation and dissemination of effective programs and policies are very constrained. We may be well-served by centering dissemination and implementation research questions.ConclusionThe productive aging perspective has advanced and offers a more complete view of the reality of the older population. Alongside the narrative that age is a problem, a decline and a loss, there exists the potential for contribution and growth. The focus has not been on individuals but on programs, policies, and social and environmental contexts to facilitate engagement in the vital roles of working, volunteering, and caregiving. There has been knowledge and intervention development; but the long-standing challenge continues to be including older people in all levels of human, social, and financial capital and including those in marginalized social positions.One of the underlying barriers to gains in facilitating productive engagement in later life is ageism. Growing evidence that ageism negatively impacts individuals and organizations brings an important impetus to the productive-aging agenda. Policies and programs will not be enough if ageist attitudes and behaviors constrain the participation of older adults in important societal roles. In this next phase of productive aging scholarship and advocacy, we must elevate our focus on ageism to improve the possibilities of a productive aging society.Nancy Morrow-Howell, PhD, is the Betty Bofinger Brown Distinguished Professor of Social Policy at Washington University in St. Louis.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Marcos CastilloReferencesAcemoglu, D., Chernozhukov, V., Werning, I., & Whinston, M.

Were missing out on the complementary skills and talents people of all ages can bring to the table, the power and energy they can create, the divides they can bridge, the communities and country they can build together. Grounded in research and on-the-ground examples, this article envisions a world where older and younger people harness the power of cogeneration, joining forces to solve problems, bridge divides, and co-create the future.Key Words:intergenerational, cogeneration, age diversity, age segregation, ageism, connection, collaboration, problem solving, mental health, environment, climate, education, service, AmeriCorpsAmerica today is the most age-diverse society in human history. Research from Stanfords Center on Longevity shows a dramatic shift in the age distribution of the U.S. population from the 1900s, when half of our population was younger than age 20, and each subsequent older age group had fewer people than the one before (Johfre, 2021). Today, we have approximately the same number of people at every age from 0 to 74, with 25% of the population younger than age 20; 23% older than age 60, and 52% in between.At the same time, were arguably the most age-segregated nation in history. Young people are clustered in schools and other settings exclusively with other young people; middle-age people predominate in workplaces; and older adults are routinely shunted to elder-only settings such as senior centers, retirement communities, and nursing homes. The generations often cease to meet at all, especially outside of families. Professor Andrew Scott of London Business School has a name for it: age apartheid (Aviva Investors, 2018).Were a society out of sync. Our demographic trajectory, cultural norms, and social organization stand at odds. Its no surprise that there are signs of generational tension, with OK Boomer and OK Millennial barbs flying; that ageism continues toward both old and young adults; and that our Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has raised the red flag on the epidemic of social isolation and loneliness, with older and younger people the two most isolated groups in society.We face the prospect of worsening division and dysfunctioneven generational warat a time when isolation, polarization, and human-resource constraints are all urgent problems. Just as important, widespread separation and segregation prevent us from realizing an immense opportunity presented by growing age diversity. We have the chance to forge meaningful bonds across generations, bridge divides of all kinds, and create stronger communities, bringing a wider array of skills and perspectives to bear on todays most pressing problems, even recapturing a sense of the wholeness of life. The question remains: Will we become a nation where generations are not only apart but at each others throats, or one that makes the most of our multigenerational future? The choice is ours.The Cogenerational SolutionEmbracing the multigenerational opportunity begins with reversing the scourge of age apartheid. But realizing the full promise of our new demographics will mean going beyond that, beyond greater interaction or even one-way efforts enabling one generation to serve the other, for all their virtues. It will mean both greater generational proximity, shared purposeand just as importantshared problem-solving. We call that level of connection and collaborationcogenerationand believe its an essential, effective strategy and a powerful solution in and of itself.Embracing the multigenerational opportunity begins with reversing the scourge of age apartheid.It wont be easy to catalyze a dramatic shift in the societal norm for the greater good from generational segregation to generational solidarity. Well need to surmount a trio of barriers stopping whats naturalsupported by an accumulation of research about human thriving, not to mention thousands of years of human behaviorfrom once again becoming the norm. The barriers are:A Failure of Imagination:After more than a century of segregation and separation, it is often hard to envision what a thriving multigenerational society looks like without slipping into sentimentality or cynicism. Meeting the multigenerational moment will require us to show how this idea is beginning to take shape and why that matters today more than ever.A Failure of Innovation:After thoroughly sorting society by age, we are going to need to be as creative in bringing the generations together as weve been in splitting them apart. It will require growing the existing constellation of opportunities for older and younger generations to work in solidarity for social impact. And it will require sparking bold new ideas that bring young and old together, on equal footing, to solve problems, forge bonds, and bridge divides.A Failure of Impetus and Investment:Moving beyond promising but boutique cogenerational models to a scale commensurate with the need and opportunity will require a thriving movement of changemakers unleashing the unique strengths of young and old alikeand increased investment. The vast majority of funders now support programs helping either younger or older people; only a few support programs that involve both older and younger people, leveraging what the Eisner Foundation, a philanthropic organization focused exclusively on funding intergenerational programs, describes as every dollar spent twice (Donloe, 2021).Cogeneration Is in the AirMaking cogeneration a viable alternative might sound utopian against the backdrop of an age-segregated nation, but in truth, our era of separation and segregation amounts to an unhappy aberration in the arc of human history. Cross-generational connection and collaboration runs with the grain of much that we know about human evolution, development, and thriving.Evolutionary anthropologists Raziel Davison and Michael Gurven (2022) have conducted extensive research on the importance of elders and their role, over millions of years, ensuring the success of the human species through food sharing, foraging, increasing the survival rate of parents, and teaching the young relevant skills, world views, and how to socialize. Grandparents are the key to us becoming human beings in the first place.But it turns out meaningful interactions with younger generations are critical for the health and well-being of older generations as well. In his book,Aging Well, Harvard psychiatrist George Vaillant (2002) highlights a study he led that spanned more than 3 decades, showing that older adults who invested in, cared for, and developed the next generation were 3 times as likely to be happy as those who did not. Indeed, the needs and assets of older and younger people fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. After a century of generational separation and segregation, change is finally in the airin popular culture, behavioral shifts, and attitudinal research.In fact, its not just in the airit is, literally, on the air. Groundbreaking, award-winning television shows likeHacks,Only Murders in the Building,Ted Lasso,Abbott Elementary, andThe Last of Ushave featured older and younger characters working together. Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, 60 years apart in age, won Grammys for their duets (Gracie, 2022). Recent films ranging fromA Man Called Otto, toTop Gun Maverick, toEverything Everywhere All at Oncehave featured Hollywood icons crossing generational divides to find new, shared purpose. A recent issue of theNew York TimesSunday Style Magazinededicated an entire issue to pairs of older and younger artists talking about how they draw inspiration from one another (Yanagihara, 2023).New research shows that a sizable segment of the younger and older populations is hungry for opportunities not only for intergenerational connection, but cogenerational actionthe chance to join forces in co-creating a better future (Encore.org, 2022).Commissioned by CoGenerate in 2022, researchers at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago surveyed a nationally representative group of 1,500 adults, ages 18 to 94, to gauge interest in working across generations to improve the world in any capacityvolunteering, getting involved in an issue you care about, or working in a paid job (Halvorsen et al., 2022). The results are cause for optimism. Nearly everyone surveyed said they believe cogeneration will make life better in America and that working together across generations will help us more easily solve societys problems and reduce divisions in our society. Moreover, people of all ages want opportunities to cogenerate.Source:https://cogenerate.org/research/cogeneration/Additionally, the survey shows that the fit is a powerful one: Young people want to learn from older ones, older people want to share what they know, and vice versa. Across the board, respondents top reasons for cogenerating relate to learning, sharing their knowledge, and increasing their appreciation for other generations.While theres strong demand for cogeneration across all ages, the strongest interest actually resides in young people, ages 18 to 25 (Encore.org, 2022). Theyre also the most likely to act on this enthusiasm. You can almost hear Gen Z calling their elders to action, delivering the message that we cant do this without you; no generation can do this alone.Cogenerationon the GroundDespite a desire to cogenerate, most people say they cant find opportunities to work with people from other generations. Others say they dont know how to productively engage or communicate across generational lines (Encore.org, 2022). Were a society that has let those muscles atrophy.Decades of policies and practices have harnessed innovation to physically segregate younger and older people for the sake of efficiency, reshuffling the structures and habits of society in ways that make it difficult to come across someone of another age group in daily life, let alone to get to know them or join forces for the greater good.Only a few funders support programs involving older and younger people.This segregation has resulted in a disastrous cascade of problems that we know all too wellfrom ageism to loneliness to splintered movements for social change. Innovation is partly to blame for getting us into this messbut it also can help to get us out of it. We need to influence our society at the systems level, stimulating new models and new ways of doing things that bring older and younger people together to tackle some of the most intractable problems of our times.So, what do older and younger generations want to do together?It turns out, researchers at the University of Chicago found, different generations articulate different priorities (Encore.org, 2022). The three youngest generations want to work together to find solutions to the mental health crisis. The two older ones are more focused on the environment. All generations want to work on education. That makes these three issue areas ripe for cogenerational innovation.Mental health.We have become a deeply lonely country, with 41% of adults older than age 65 andtwice that number of young adultsreporting feeling lonely (Holt-Lunstad, 2023). The Surgeon Generals recent advisory on our countrys epidemic of loneliness and isolation raised the alarm on a corresponding rise in our countrys mental health crisis. According to the Surgeon General, the risk of developing depression among people who report feeling lonely is more than double that of people who rarely or never feel lonelyand the compounding impacts of loneliness and social isolation in childhood increase the risk of depression and anxiety for young people both immediately and well into the future (Holt-Lunstad, 2023).Cogenerational approaches anchored in social connection and collaboration offer the perfect antidote to social isolation and loneliness. The Fresno Economic Opportunities Commission, for example, launched a new, three-generation wellness pilot program last fall based on the 87 emotions featured in Bren Browns book,Atlas of the Heart(Gibson, 2023). AmeriCorps Seniors Foster Grandparents (all ages 55 and older) joined forces with a mix of college students and other young adults in the community to co-create and teach lesson plans on emotional literacy to youth at two local Boys and Girls Clubs and the local YouthBuild charter school. Together, they created meaningful connections within and across generations, and, just as important, modeled the importance of prioritizing mental wellness at every life stage.Other organizations are developing intergenerational and culturally specific approaches to mental health.Hey Auntie!a digital wellness platform and community rooted in the ethos and cultural legacy of the Black Auntieis one example. It addresses racial disparities in mental health for Black women across ages and life stages by curating groups of six women (half older than age 50 and half younger) who are matched for a series of virtual conversations on a set of topics designed to help them get to know one another and develop a robust, intergenerational network of support.Environment. Contrary to popular narratives that older generations dont care about climate change, recent opinion polls show awareness and concern have actually increased across all generations at a similar rate (Milfont et al., 2021). The generation gap occurs because older people started from a lower initial belief level to begin with. This, combined with older generations deep interest in working on environmental issues with young people (Halvorsen et al., 2022), offers hope for collective action to protect the well-being of our planet.Third Act, founded and cogenerationally led by Bill McKibben and Vanessa Arcara, is harnessing the vast skills and resources of the fast-growing ages 60 and older population in the United States to protect the climate and strengthen democracy for future generations. Whether educating older generations on climate issues, co-authoring Op-Eds with youth to expand their platform and voice, or rallying older people to show up as allies to young people in local campaigns, Third Act is creating a powerful generational bridge in support of a shared future.Young Entertainment Activist (YEA) founder Samuel Rubin is taking a different cogenerational approach to tackling the climate problem by launching the annualHollywood Climate Summit, a gathering of thousands of environmental changemakers and entertainment-industry professionals of all ages. The most recent Summit included an intergenerational panel featuring Oscar-nominated actor Stephanie Hsu, Youth Climate Collaborative founder Pooja Tivawala, and actor/author/activist Mimi Kennedy, all discussing popular medias surface-level depictions of climate activists and generational differences on the crisis, ageism and discrimination in Hollywood, and actionable advice for how to shift those portrayals and experiences in future content.Education. An issue area that is consistently a top priority for older and younger generations is education, creating ample opportunity to leverage the unique skills and assets of older and younger generations to support student learning and academic outcomes.Ampacts Reading and Math Corpsis one such organization. Their program in Georgia and Minneapolis mobilizes more than 500 age-diverse AmeriCorps members as tutors in schools, working together to help K8 students build their reading and math skills and become better learners. Along the way, the tutors form lasting intergenerational friendships. In a recent survey, 70% of the tutors said serving alongside a member of a different generation increased opportunities to interact meaningfully with people of a different generation, 48% said serving on an intergenerational team made them better at establishing strong relationships with the students they tutored, and 60% said it made them a better tutor.The three youngest generations want to work together to find solutions to the mental health crisis. The two older ones are more focused on the environment.Another area of cogenerational innovation in education is directed at affordable housing for college students. Today, one fifth of U.S. students struggle to find affordable rent near campus, impacting college completion rates and future financial stability (Cushnahan, 2022). Meanwhile, millions of spare bedrooms sit empty every night, often in the homes of older adults living alone, struggling to maintain their houses as they age.Second Story Collective, a community partnership with Drexel University in West Philadelphia, andHomeShare OC, a program of Homeless Intervention Services of Orange County, match housing insecure college students with older empty nesters. Students pay below-market rent and provide extra help around the house. Older adults get to age in place. These intergenerational co-living models build caring, intentional communities that are a clear win-win.A Vision for the FutureIn his bookHow Change Happens, Harvard Law School professor Cass Sunstein (2023) argues that prevailing societal norms often are far more fragile than assumed, poised to be disrupted by new norms better-suited to present and future circumstances. Were convinced that the longstanding societal default of generations apart is increasingly being challenged by a new norm characterized by generations together, joining forces for mutual benefit and wider impact. Were at a ripe moment for changea tipping point.As the previous examples illustrate, when older and younger generations work together to solve problems, its a clear win-win for society. Intergenerational connection and collaboration have the potential to:Mitigate the public health crisis that loneliness poses for young and old alike.Reduce ageism and improve the health and well-being of people of all ages.Expand young peoples network of relationships with people who have life experience and career connections.Build a more sustainable and robust multigenerational workforce.Improve service to communities by bringing a greater diversity of perspectives, skills, and life experiences to the table.Reduce polarization and create more empathy and understanding across the divides of race, culture, background, economic status, and identity.Still, it would be a mistake to assume that the old norm will be displaced easily or automatically, by narrative shifts or innovation alone. We need to put cogeneration on the path toward scalability and sustainability by supporting a thriving, connected and well-funded field with a life of its own. To achieve that, we need to work at a systems level, proactively breaking down age silos in institutional structures, policies, and funding.Some early signals of change on the horizon are starting to take shape at the city, state and national levels.For example, the Los Angeles Mayors Office of Economic Opportunity recently announced a partnership with the citys Department of Aging to facilitate more cogenerational approaches to their work (Hernandez, 2023). This collaborative structure is inspired by a three-generation model developed by the city to address the early childhood workforce shortage in Los Angeles County by giving community college students a paid internship at a child development centerand pairing them with an older, experienced educator to support their success.Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has launched an ambitious new Department of Service and Civic Innovation anchored in an intergenerational approach that offers every graduating high schooler in the state the chance to become an AmeriCorps member. Each member will be assigned to an older mentor for training and development (Maryland Department of Service and Civic Innovation, 2023). United in shared purpose and service, young people and older adults alike will have the opportunity to not only serve their communities, but also to serve with their communities.At the federal level, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Harvard psychologist Rick Weissbourd (2023) recently penned an Op-Ed in TIME calling on policymakers to support the expansion of programs like CoGeneratesGenerations Serving Together, which unites older and younger generations in solving problems that no generation can solve alone and that curbs loneliness, which especially afflicts not only the young but senior citizens. Dramatic expansion of programs that encourage intergenerational connection and collaboration will require more flexible federal and philanthropic dollars that move beyond the traditional silos of youth or aging funding and instead incentivize intersectional approaches to problem-solving that can help us unleash a multigenerational force for good.The time is ripe to create a society that capitalizes on the opportunity of age diversity in ways that enrich individual lives, create greater social cohesion, and establish a new pattern of cross-generational collaboration suited to our multigenerational future. One that reflects all that we know about how critical generational connection and collaboration are to individual and social well-being.We envision a world where generations come together collaboratively in neighborhoods, educational settings, workplaces, in all aspects of daily life. One where the perspectives and skills of youngers and olders are seen as essential ingredients in effective problem-solving. One where an ethos of cogenerativity, of working together across difference to create a better future, becomes the norm.Instead of a multigenerational future defined by conflict, misunderstanding, and isolation, lets help create the village it will take for all ages to come together in joy, understanding, and action. Each of us has a role to play in building that better future.Eunice Lin Nichols is co-CEO of CoGenerate, and received the James Irvine Foundation Leadership Award for advancing innovative and effective solutions for Californias most significant issues.

JarrottFebruary 14, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingEquity & JusticeAbstract:Intergenerational programs engage youth (ages 24 and younger) and adults (ages 50 and older) in intentional, shared programming. Research consistently reveals positive outcomes reflecting varied program goals and participants. Not everyone has equal access to intergenerational programs. Also, participants may not experience comparable outcomes. This article presents two theories; one depicts factors influencing access to intergenerational program participation. The second describes conditions of intergenerational contact that promote positive outcomes for all. Intergenerational examples illustrate positive results from the ways community stakeholders apply these theories to open opportunities for productivity via participating in intergenerational programs.Key Words:contact theory, ecological systems theory, intergenerational program, strengths-based, productive agingIntergenerational programs intentionally engage youth and older adults in shared programming to achieve a range of goals. They can unite heterogeneous communities to support productive activities for everyoneifthey are done well. Some programs launch with the best intentions and pay great attention to intended participants, only to find the program does not achieve its goals and fades away after a few months. Grounding the program in theory increases chances of success.This article presents two theories. The first, ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006), illustrates the layers of influence on intergenerational programs and their participants. The second, contact theory (Pettigrew, 1998), provides an easy-to-follow map for promoting positive connections between younger and older persons. Both are helpful for considering how individuals with diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and interests might have varied access to intergenerational programs, face unique barriers to participation, and seek different qualities in an intergenerational program. The call to action reflects how practitioners and policymakers shape the intergenerational environment experienced by young and older participants.Ecological Systems Theory as a Tool to Diversify Practice and PolicyEcological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) depicts the bi-directional influence of an individual within multiple nested environments. Features of the micro-, meso-, macro-, exo-, and chrono-systems reflect the history, politics, culture, and societal mores that envelop a person. Thus, variations in individual development may be explored by studying how environments and individuals interact with and influence one another. This model allows us to consider intergenerational program participation. Features of each system can be studied to identify who most needs and can benefit from intergenerational programming, barriers to participation, and actions that can be taken to promote positive outcomes across varied participants and content. What follows is a tour of Bronfenbrenners ecological systems, illustrated with examples from mixed intergenerational programs.Microsystems are settings in which an individual spends most of their time. For a child, this typically includes home and school; it may also include church or the home of grandparents or another caregiver. An individuals need for opportunities to engage in intergenerational programs reflects their microsystems. An older adult whose microsystem is limited to home, where they have no interaction with young people, could benefit from joining in-person and virtual opportunities for productive activities with young people. Home-delivered meal programs offer opportunities to support social contact in the older adults microsystem (Thomas et al., 2020).An individual also may be isolated by language or geography. For example,AGE to Age, a multisite program coordinated by the Northland Foundation to support intergenerational ties in rural Minnesota, develops shared programs to reflect the needs and interests in communities where they operate. Project SHINE has been replicated in several states (Skilton-Sylvester & Garcia, 1998), engaging university students as tutors to older immigrants preparing for citizenship tests. Extending intergenerational programs to the many types of microsystems younger and older people occupy will increase their opportunities to enjoy the benefits of intentional shared programming.Mesosystems represent the interactions between an individuals microsystems, such as the interactions between caregivers at a childs home and their school. The strength of the school mesosystem is influenced by language and socioeconomics. If school representatives cannot speak the same language as a childs caregiver or if a parent lacks the time and means to communicate with the school due to work or transportation obstacles, the mesosystem may be weak, and the student may be denied valuable opportunities. For example, teens might bring home a form asking parental permission for the student to volunteer at a residence for older adults. Parents might refuse this permission if they do not have the time or means to communicate with a teacher about supervision and safety concerns; intergenerational program leaders should ensure that communication about programming is delivered via multiple outlets and in languages the intended audience can comprehend (Henkin, 2021). In this way, potential participants (and their guardians) can make an informed decision about joining an intergenerational program.Younger and older people both experience ageism, which frequently intersects with racism, sexism, and ableism.Exosystems represent settings that affect an individual indirectly. For example, a low-income older adult will not participate in a summer feeding program for school children, but policies that silo nutrition program funding by age group will impact opportunities that older adult has for intergenerational contact at their congregate meal site. Here, local or state government is the exosystem; the older adult does not have direct contact with it but is nonetheless impacted by its actions.On a related note, mass media tends to stereotype older adults as incompetent and often promotes concepts like stranger danger. Such images can dampen public interest in providing environments or programs that encourage intergenerational contact, even when provisions are made to protect the safety of all involved. The reauthorizedOlder Americans Act(OAA) of 2020 added language that encourages intergenerational service delivery. These services would likely be supported throughTitle IIIfunding, such as senior centers, which often serve older adults with limited financial means and social networks. By encouraging intergenerational service delivery, the OAA legislation represents an exosystem that supports intergenerational contact among those who might most benefit from it.The macrosystem reflects attitudes and ideologies of a culture. Many of us belong to multiple cultures reflecting our nationality, citizenship, religion, and geographic location, among other things. In the United States, ideologies about young people and older adults tend to emphasize dependence over autonomy. Younger and older people both experience ageism, which frequently intersects with racism, sexism, and ableism (World Health Organization, 2021). It is no wonder that both the young and old are viewed through a deficit lens. In contrast, a macrosystem with strengths-based ideologies recognizes that younger and older people with heterogeneous interests and abilities have talents to share with one another and with society at large. Intergenerational programs typically embrace this strengths perspective by offering meaningful, developmental- and age-appropriate roles for younger and older participants (Gonzales & Jarrott, 2023).Finally, the chronosystem reflects how systems change with time and as the individual matures. Young people who migrate to another country tend to acculturate, adopting ideologies reflecting their adopted country, which may change their view of older adults and their own aging over time. The influence of history on the experiences and opportunities of different generations is well-documented (Elder, 1998). Historical influences, like improved medicine that contributed to increased life expectancy and the opioid crisis that resulted in growing numbers of kinship caregivers, have shaped the need and opportunity for intergenerational relationships. Strengths-based intergenerational programs densely connected through individuals mesosystems can harness historical influences to support positive intergenerational ties and wide-ranging individual, relational, and community goals.Ecological systems theory is valuable due to its comprehensiveness. It illustrates factors that can differentiate who might benefit most from intergenerational programming, who faces the most barriers to intergenerational program engagement, and the different ecosystems that can be targeted for change to enhance access to intergenerational programs. At every system level, individuals and organizations can act to support productive engagement in shared programming. Microsystems such as schools, churches, and health services can incorporate intergenerational opportunities, including by forming ties with other microsystems to create a mesosystem populated with people of all ages and varied opportunities for productive engagement. Within the exosystem, organizational, local, and national policies can promote rather than discourage intergenerational contact. For example, school districts can establish procedures that allow community members to volunteer in schools, or counties may decide to deliver services in a shared space to all who need them, regardless of age. Working to reduce ageism and other oppressive systems at the macrolevel can dispel negative attitudes and discourage discriminatory practices that limit contact between disparate groups.Ecological systems theorys comprehensiveness also can be frustrating, leaving individuals and organizations convinced that there is no way to impact all factors influencing access to and engagement with intergenerational programs. Recalling that a good intergenerational program is successful because of relationships among members, we should be encouraged to build relationships that allow each of us to effect positive change in our professional roles and as community members. In this way, we can each contribute to a supportive intergenerational environment. Next, we look beyond systems influencing intergenerational program availability and participation and call upon contact theory to guide how we bring young and older people together for shared, productive activities.Contact Theory as a Tool to Diversify Practice and PolicyContact theory is the most widely cited theory guiding intergenerational program development and study (Martins et al., 2019). First adapted to the intergenerational setting by Caspi (1984), the contact hypothesis was developed by Gordon Allport (1954) in response to racial tensions in the United States in the 1950s. Thomas Pettigrew, a student of Gordon Allport, continues to study contact theory today. Since its introduction, contact theory has been used to study intergroup contact across disparate racial, religious, disciplinary, and age groups (Pettigrew, 1998).The theory is useful as it consists of just a handful of tenets associated with positive intergroup contact indicated by positive attitudinal change toward members of the outgroup. The more tenets present in the contact setting, the greater the likelihood that people will experience the contact positively. We apply those five tenets to intergenerational program examples next. Different cultures have their own customs of intergenerational contact, and program leaders should be familiar with those customs to achieve contact theory tenets in ways that are appropriate for intended participants. For example, some cultures have a clear generational hierarchy in which young people are expected to serve older adults; leaders of programming in settings predominated by members of such a culture will want to be intentional in how they enact the theory tenets to respect cultural traditions (Henkin, 2021).A teen and an older adult conducting a mock job interview might be helping the teen build confidence and speaking skills while the adult develops generativity.Intergenerational contact is endorsed by authority figures, custom, or law. An organization may demonstrate its support for intergenerational contact by authorizing staff members to spend time co-developing program plans or by dedicating funding to an intergenerational coordinator and to programming (Weaver et al., 2019). Services that facilitate ongoing intergenerational programming and annual events, likeSan Diego CountysIntergenerational Games, demonstrate institutional support for intergenerational contact through a tradition of shared programming. Law or policy can endorse intergenerational contact by specifying that funding for services is intended to reach all age groups, such as Older American Actfunded programs.At the local level, an organization might adopt a mission statement reflecting a value for intergenerational contact, such asONEgenerationsmission to support and enrich the lives of older adults, children, and families throughout our diverse communities. Contact is characterized by cooperation rather than competition. Intentional strategies can unite young and older people to work together. The physical environment may be set up to promote intergenerational partnership, such as designating alternating chairs for younger and older adults and providing one set of materials to share between intergenerational partners (Norouzi et al., 2019). Program leaders can use directions and facilitate conversation that supports cooperation.Participants in intergenerational programs work toward a common goal, although youth and older adults sharing an activity may also be working toward different priorities at the same time. For example, a teen and an older adult conducting a mock job interview might be helping the teen build confidence and speaking skills while the adult develops generativity. Still, they share a common goal of relationship-building and mutual support. Relationships are how intergenerational programs achieve most of their fabulously varied goals, and thus positive intergenerational relationships are a common goal youth and older participants share.Participants experience equal group status in the contact setting. This tenet warrants some explanation. It would be easy to interpret equal group status as an expectation that youth and older adults are treated equally. However, this could result in infantilization of older people or the projection of adult characteristics onto youth, both of which are unfortunately common at intergenerational programs. Rather, equal group status reflects a strengths-based approach, recognizing that each young person and each older adult has something to contribute to and receive from the shared activity (Jarrott et al., 2019). An older adult with dementia can help a child develop their fine motor skills in shared Montessori-based programming (Camp & Lee, 2011), regaining a valued role as teacher. A teen delivering meals to home-bound elders can share their mobility while learning about the importance of civic engagement and improving their driving skills.A final tenet of contact theory was added by Pettigrew in 1998. Participants should have the opportunity to build friendships through their shared contact. Friendships result from repeated contact, self-disclosure, and the sharing of pleasant activitiesthings that we have all experienced in our own friendships. Thus, younger and older persons should have repeated opportunities to interact with consistent social partners. Shared activities should elicit the sharing of ones stories; when younger or older adults are unable to share their stories, whether due to language differences, developmental stage (e.g., babies), or disease conditions, program leaders can share stories on behalf of participants (Jarrott et al., 2019). Finally, programming should be fun. Because not all youth and adults enjoy the same things, program content should be varied, and individuals should be able to choose whether to participate, with an attractive alternative available to those not choosing to join proffered intergenerational activities.Participants should have the opportunity to build friendships through their shared contact.Contact theory has proven invaluable to all manner of intergenerational programs because it involves a reasonable number of principles that can be flexibly applied to varied participants, content, and contexts. Researchers have used contact theory to develop additional resources, such asactivity guides,planning resources,continuing education courses, andevaluation tools(see also Jarrott, 2006, Jarrott et al., 2019, 2021). Interesting intergenerational research questions remain to be addressed through the application of contact theory. For example, given critics concerns that self-selection into intergenerational programs biases outcomes (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), researchers may want to conduct randomized trials in which individuals are assigned to tasks in single-generation and intergenerational contexts. Also, researchers are curious whether facilitated contact with an outgroup member (in this case, an older adult) whose membership in the outgroup is salient (Hewstone & Brown, 1986) generalizes to contact with an unknown outgroup member in another setting and even to oneself when one joins that outgroup, such as when individuals age into older adulthood (Pettigrew, 1998; Scrivano & Jarrott, 2023).Call to ActionExploring intergenerational programs within the massive ecological systems theory and using the tools provided by contact theory, anyone can find a call to action that matches their interests, skills, position, and resources. We can challenge ageist, othering stereotypes that dampen enthusiasm for intergenerational ties;Reframing Agingoffers valuable resources for understanding and changing how we communicate about people based on their age. We can locate ourselves within the ecological systems of the older and younger persons who most need positive intergenerational ties and act within our professional roles or personal commitments. We can search out and forge partnerships with counterparts in the same system, as when members of thePennsylvania Intergenerational Networkconvene.Or we can reach across layers to amplify our talents through cross-sector collaboration, as when service providers and local regulators meet to discuss how licensing regulations promote and prohibit intergenerational connections. We can acknowledge the individual differences that create barriers for some to benefit from intergenerational programs and work to eliminate those barriers and celebrate the differences, as the Cambodian Association of Greater Philadelphia does with theirLegacy Project, which engages younger and older adults in shared cultural traditions. Our call to action is to map our efforts at every level in the ecological system to ensure all who could benefit from intergenerational ties do so.One weakness (and a strength) of ecological systems theory is that it is so all-encompassing that it lacks detail on how-to support individual development through intergenerational programs. Thus, the call to action also reflects contact theory. Locating our position in the ecological system can help to indicate which contact theory tenets we can realistically support. Most of the tenets relate closely to the work of people in the micro- and meso-systems. These are the program leaders, volunteer supervisors, instructors, and therapeutic specialists who support cooperation, common goals, friendship, and equal group status by recruiting and preparing program stakeholders and implementing shared programming. These are the staff who communicate with stakeholders to learn about interests and concerns and respond to these with clear messaging about intergenerational opportunities.Organizational, local, and national policymakers positioned in the meso- and exo- systems, such as managers, directors, CEOs, licensing officials, and lawmakers, can best support shared programming by demonstrating commitment for intergenerational ties through mission and value statements, job descriptions, and budgets. Family, other members of individuals microsystems, and the younger and older participants also are critical sources of support for intergenerational ties. They need and should seek chances to shape opportunities that match their needs and interests. Each of us has a call to action; wherever we fall in Bronfenbrenners group of systems and whichever contact theory tenet aligns with our responsibilities and opportunities, there is room for all of us to advance access to intergenerational programs.Shannon E.

But connection, particularly across age, gender, ethnic, and socioeconomic divides, lays the foundation to address social inequities and create a better future for all. Intergenerational programs combat loneliness while bridging our many divides, laying the groundwork for structural change while creating immediate, concrete benefits for individuals that counteract structural inequities in health, education, housing, and more.Key Words:intergenerational, loneliness, ageism, social isolation, social connection, philanthropyThe pessimists among us say the future is bleak. In the United States, children face structural challenges disproportionately affecting communities of color and low-income populations that impede their access to education, safety, healthcare, and economic opportunity. Our aging population, inelegantly referred to as a silver tsunami (Greenlee, 2020), faces an uncertain future as the social safety net becomes increasingly precarious. These inequities grow as income inequality, inflation, and climate change loom and divisions heighten. Meanwhile, we are lonelier than ever, with potentially catastrophic physical and mental health implications.But amid this, we are desperate for connection (Martino et al., 2017). And connection, particularly across age, gender, ethnic, and socioeconomic divides, lays the foundation to address these social inequities and create a better future for all.Fortunately, there is a solution to this need for connection that not only brings people together across divides, but also addresses social challenges at the same time: create, implement, and support high-quality intergenerational programs, where older and younger people are brought together to learn from and support one another.These types of programs are developing nationwide, partly out of demographic necessity, but largely due to their record of delivering high-quality outcomes.Intergenerational programs can address challenges in education through tutoring and mentoring programs, break down ageism and improve health outcomes at shared sites like preschools inside senior centers or senior housing on college campuses, and improve housing stability for older and young adults through home-sharing programs. They create opportunities to make art, share stories, and build solidarity within historically marginalized groups. And rather than being beneficiaries of services, participants are treated as resources and assets who can create positive outcomes for one another and their communities.Breaking Down BarriersThis is not some aspirational wouldnt it be nice? sentimentality. Intergenerational programs address critical needs while fostering purpose and joycreating a longer-lasting, empowering intervention that ripples through a community. They are proven and transformative vehicles for advancing equity.Inequities permeate the fabric of our society, and one of the fundamental challenges to addressing them is that those who have been granted an equitable share of the proverbial pot often cannot, or will not, see that others being denied equity are just like themonly of a different gender, race, or socioeconomic status. But when it comes to age, it is a division where the old were once the young, and if all goes well, the young will become the old. When it comes to age divides, its harder to define the other as anything but you, simply at a different stage of life.Intergenerational programs break down the othering in our society, starting with age, but often reaching beyond. This connection, and the understanding and empathy that comes with it, create the foundation for profound systemic change.At The Eisner Foundation, we have been funding and partnering with nonprofit organizations working intergenerationally for a decade. I have seen firsthand how these programs have the power to bring us together, improve health and education outcomes, and dramatically reduce loneliness. But it is essential that they are created with intentionality, an adherence to best practices, a commitment to cultural competencies, and a blueprint for measuring success. It is not enough to put people of different ages and backgrounds in a room together.We cant lose that instinct to help across age, race, and socioeconomic status.For these programs to have the greatest effect on all involved, participants must be primed for the experience, and given the foundation of empathy that will allow for more fruitful interactions. This is particularly important when people of privileged backgrounds interact with people from historically marginalized backgrounds. Whether its cultural sensitivity training for adults working with children of color or simulations for students working with older people with mental or physical challenges, or simply a reflection on biases about people of other ages, a critical examination of prejudices and expectations allows participants to come to their intergenerational interactions with a more open mind and enables them to genuinely help one another without perpetuating harms. And with proper education and training, addressing stereotypes and attitudes can have far wider implications as participants take new perspectives with them into their communities and social circles.An Instinct to HelpIt is natural to want to help those who are younger than you. The word generativity is somehow both overused and yet seldom understood, but the concept is innate. Society does work best when we plant trees under which we will never sit.We have an instinct to connect and to help one another. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our first instinct was to look around, see who needed help, and jump in with providing that help, even for people we didnt know. Inequities were thrown into sharp relief, and we came together temporarily to try to solve them. Young people created informal networks to grocery shop for older people. Older people learned Zoom to continue tutoring kids who were now trying to learn at home.But over time, we shifted to focus on the divisions in our societyespecially around vaccines and mask mandatesand this has become the dominant narrative of the pandemic. But our first instinct in those initial terrifying months was to reach out, connect, and help.We cant lose that instinct to help across age, race, and socioeconomic statusbut we must continually keep this imperative top-of-mind, not necessarily in the context of a pandemic, but as a societal necessity. It needs to be reframed from providing help to providing a community good, with the understanding that by increasing intergenerational and intersectional social connections, we can create a society that understands that increased equity and social justice means a better life for all of us.Building Mutual Understanding to Counter InequitiesWe know that as our society is increasingly segregated by age, race, and socioeconomic status, the resulting us vs. them mentality creates a scarcity mindset that affects our instinct to connect and help. But intergenerational programs give participants the push to find common ground.We also know that ageism, sexism, and racism are extremely damaging to our social fabric, and interacting with people different from ourselves can help counter these. For example, some of our grantees leverage older volunteers to work with kids from historically marginalized backgrounds. The adults often are from different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds than the kids, and they likely wouldnt have a chance to get to know one another outside these programs. But here, they build mutual understanding. The shared vision is created in a way that few other social programs can be.Through our work at The Eisner Foundation, weve heard from several volunteers that getting to know these children changed the way they think about things like the child welfare system or our education system, and it has even changed the way they vote. For example, the volunteers at the Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program and 826LA come to help one child, but after going through the program they find that this kid is just a kid, much like their own would be if he were Black or Brown or living with few resources. These volunteers often find themselves with fresh motivation to make their communities better for everyone in them.This happens frequently for volunteers in the CASA program, which matches caring adults with youth in the child welfare system to ensure their needs are heard and met as they move through the court system. CASA volunteers write briefs for the court, work with teachers and school administrators, and even manage healthcare when needed. Because of the intensive time commitment, CASA volunteers are often older. And for those volunteers who havent interacted with the child welfare system before, it can be eye-opening.Onevolunteerreported that her training and subsequent work showed her how many systemic challenges the children in her care faced, and changed the way she thought about those systems and the people in them (The Eisner Foundation, 2017). With that new mindset, she shared her experiences with her friends and family, and even thought more critically about how the child welfare, education, and healthcare systems were run and supported when she voted in local elections. As intergenerational programs engage more volunteers, it will be easier to break down systemic barriers to success for marginalized communities while empowering those within them.Intergenerational programs dont just affect the attitudes of the older participants. We also know that kids who interact with older adults starting at a young age are more empathetic and comfortable around people with disabilities and older adults throughout their lifetimes (Jayson, 2018). These programs create future generations that understand and care about their elders and dont see them as a greedy group trying to steal their futures, but as a population with much to give and worthy of security and dignity as they age.We see this at ONEgeneration, an intergenerational shared site that includes eldercare and childcare on the same campus. Throughout the day, older adults and children as young as 6 months old come together for meals and other activities. At many eldercare facilities, the older adults are simply recipients of services. But here, theyre active participants in the care and development of young children. Meanwhile, the children engage with older adults from a wide range of backgrounds, normalizing different physical, mental, and even linguistic abilitiescombating potential othering from the earliest years of their lives.In documenting the elders lives, they gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the individuals and the wider community in which they live.And at KYCCs Koreatown Storytelling Project, high school students seeking journalism experience are matched with local older adults to preserve their stories. The older members of this multicultural neighborhood include a large proportion of immigrants whose experience is critical to the story of Los Angeles, and in documenting the elders lives, they gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the individuals and the wider community in which they live. Over time, the Koreatown Storytelling Project has expanded to bring together generations in creative ways, including a Storytelling through Recipes effort that encourages connection through cooking recipes from an elders upbringing.If intergenerational programs simply reduced biases and created a more cohesive society, that would be enough of a reason to fully support them. But we know that quality intergenerational programs have the potential to create measurable concrete benefits for the individuals involvedwhich is worth pursuing in itself, but also goes a long way toward counteracting the structural inequities that limit peoples opportunities to pursue happiness and equality.Individual BenefitsIntergenerational programs also have concrete benefits for individuals that can help counteract structural inequities. Older adults engaging in quality intergenerational programs usually see health improvements, many of them dramatic and life-changing. For example, at Generation Xchange, older, largely Black volunteers tutor and mentor kids in South LA elementary schools for 15 hours a week. As the students have demonstrated gains in academic and behavioral performance, the older volunteers have showed measurable improvement in walking speed, mobility, and genetic health markers (Seeman et al., 2020).They also reduced the medications they took and felt happier and more engaged in their community. This is a by-product of them not only finding purpose in helping the kids who need them, but also by joining a new community of their fellow volunteers meeting regularly to create plans for addressing inequities and to be social. The correlation between purpose and community, and that of positive health outcomes, is real and measurable.Another high-quality intergenerational program creating positive outcomes is Reading Partners, a national organization dedicated to improving reading performance among elementary students across the country. By placing trained volunteers in under-resourced schools who commit to supporting a child for at least one school year, they facilitate long-term bonds between tutor and student. Students in this program make real strides in overcoming the systemic challenges they face by regularly meeting or exceeding academic benchmarks and showing improvements in social-emotional learning skills (Child Trends, 2019). The relationship between tutor and student is also key, as the impacts are statistically greatest with long-term, frequent connections with their tutor.Another example? How about NYUs Center for Health and Aging Innovation, which is facilitating home-sharing arrangements between older New Yorkers and NYU students, two groups that have been disadvantaged in the New York housing market. By pairing them, students have a safe, low-cost place to live, while older residents can make extra income and remain in their home with someone who can help around the house. Meanwhile, long-term friendships can develop from these arrangements, and the two generations build a deeper understanding of the others perspective.These programs also can help build resiliency and power within historically marginalized communities. For example, SAGE, The Generations Project, and the Los Angeles LGBT Center connect members of the LGBTQ+ community of all ages, a community that disproportionally experiences higher levels of homelessness and mental health challenges. By creating an intergenerational community, these groups learn from one anothers experiences and find strength in numbers. Similar efforts connecting people from historically marginalized backgrounds and lived experience are happening at House of Ruth (survivors of domestic violence), Friendship Foundation (people with special needs), VISIONS/Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and Creative Acts (people who have experienced incarceration).Intergenerational programs, when done right, have a dramatic ability to bring us together, to build power among the participants, to provide purpose, and to facilitate efficient and effective solutions that create consensus, not conflict.Whats Next?So, this is all fine and good, but what should we do now?If you are a nonprofit decision-maker, please consider creating intergenerational programs, no matter what type of charitable outcome you are attempting to achieve. They are not only efficient, but effective. And when you do, it is vital that you are deliberate in doing the preparatory groundwork, with both groups, before you start.You must address the stereotypes that are lurking, talk openly about biases, and put a plan in place to prime the glorious interactions that lie ahead. You cant just put people together in a room, clap your hands, and wait for the shared vision. Intentionality and planning are key. But this is easier than you might thinkGenerations United has created a step-by-steptoolkitfor this process.If you are a funder or a policymaker with access to funding, please get out of your silo. Explore intersectional approaches to solving social challenges that bring people together and be open-minded in your approach. Funders should support pilot programs and government should support efforts to take them to scaleand reduce red tape wherever possible. We all need to be more focused on outcomes, and less on parameters and policies. I have hundreds of grantees who have evidence of transformational outcomes, and operate with an intergenerational lens, but may not fit into every funders strict siloes of funding requirements.And if youre neither a funder nor a nonprofit but want to join this movement, please seek out opportunities to connect with someone of a different generation. You can start by having a meaningful conversation with a relative who is older or younger and expand this effort with coworkers or neighbors. Look for organizations in your community looking for volunteersor start one yourself. Were not broken; were just disconnected. And the fastest way to fix that is to reach out to someone.Trent Stamp is CEO of The Eisner Foundation in Los Angeles, the only U.S.-based foundation solely focused on intergenerational programs.Photo caption: A woman volunteers with young children at the Koreatown Youth+ Community Center in Los Angeles.Photo credit: Courtesy of the Eisner Foundation.ReferencesChild Trends.

This article reviews theoretical perspectives and key concepts to systematically dismantle stereotypes, namely psychosocial and critical race theories. We provide examples of intergenerational programs undoing racist and ageist structures across the micro to macro continuum. We conclude with implications for research, practice, education, advocacy, and policy.Key Words:stereotypes, bias, parasocial contact, intergroup contact, critical race theory, ageism, racism, intergenerational, equity, volunteering, social media, intergenerational programming, intergenerational research, policy recommendationsSocieties worldwide are becoming, and will continue to be, increasingly diverse in terms of race, age, and a confluence of intersecting identities. Yet, mistrust and discrimination are at the highest levels seen in recent history (Terrell et al., 2009). Racial injustice and intergenerational conflict are undermining a longevity opportunity: to live a long and healthy life with a solid economic foundation; with strong social bonds to family, friends, and community; in a diverse, loving, and peaceful society.Racism and ageism result in deleterious health outcomes among individuals, families, and society. Racist and ageist policies set the stage for health inequities to endure. Studies have made a clear link between interpersonal and institutionalized racism and ageism with negative impacts on chronic health conditions, cognitive health, and life expectancy.Racism and ageism share common features: both are structural, endemic, global and internal, and interact across the micro to macro continuum over ones life span, one generation after the next. Across racial and ethnic identities, older adults in the Health and Retirement Study report they have much in common: ageism (Gonzales, Lee, & Marchiondo, 2021). Blacks, Hispanics, and White older adults rank ageism as the first or second form of bias in their everyday lives. Moreover, emerging professionals (ages 1830) report similar rates of age discrimination as older adults (ages 50 and older) in the workplace, with harmful effects on mental health, occupational well-being, job satisfaction, and commitment to organizations (Marchiondo et al., 2015). Ageism is a common experience across generations, races, and ethnicities.This article has two aims to: 1) review theoretical perspectives to inform interventions to systematically dismantle stereotypes, namely psychosocial and critical race theories, and 2) provide examples of intergenerational programs undoing racist and ageist structures. It concludes with implications for readers ofGenerations.Theoretical Perspectives on Stereotypes and InterventionsPsychosocial PerspectivesStereotypes have three universal mechanisms:cognition(e.g., stereotyping),affect(e.g., negative and positive attitudes), andbehavior(e.g., avoidance, discrimination, violence), also known as the CAB model (Jhangiani & Tarry, 2022). Cognitive stereotypes, along with the affective component, inform behavior. All too often, corporate and legal policies punish a particular behavior (e.g., age or race discrimination in the workplace or educational setting) without addressing the root cognitive and affective beliefs that inform the biased behavior.Rather than punishment and discipline, a more compassionate and humane approach is to facilitate anempathic epiphanythat is, enable participants to critically reflect on their worldviews and associated assumptions about race and ageto consciously deconstruct a stereotypic perspective.Participants who say, I didnt realize we had so much in common, are demonstrating that an empathic epiphany occurred. An unprejudiced mind can lead to fairer treatment across groups, an open attitude for engagement with different people on common goals, and can establish a starting point with respect and openness.Efforts to end ageism and racism, as well as other forms of bias, have been siloed far too long.The Intergroup Contact Hypothesis by Gordon Allport (1954/1988) is an effective theoretical framework for undoing stereotypes and facilitating a context for empathic epiphanies. This framework suggests a persons mind is transformed when they encounter a person from the outgroup who is not representative of the stereotype, the pair engages in a shared activity with equal status, and the interaction is endorsed by a higher authority. Although there are more than 25,000 scientific articles informed by this framework, only 27 have a random assignment with delayed outcome measures (Paluck et al., 2019).Findings suggest contact typically reduces prejudice. The theory has been used to successfully disrupt ethnic or racial prejudice, as well as bias toward people because of their religious orientation, sexual and gender identities, gender, neuro-diversity, and age (Paluck et al., 2019). There is some evidence to suggest that effects of the intervention can extend into real-world interactions where we live, work, and play. In our scoping review of this literature (which is underway), we have not yet encountered one intervention that intentionally targets two -isms simultaneously (i.e., ageism and racism).Critical Race TheoryWhile critical race theory (CRT) acknowledges the importance of confronting stereotypes, and many interventions addressing race and racism are situated at the interpersonal level (Paluck et al., 2019). CRT takes the psychosocial perspective (e.g., Intergroup Contact Hypothesis) further with three observations.First, psychosocial interventions assumesocial conditioningis the mechanism to achieve a just and equitable society. The theoretical assumption is that if everyone could see the individual before them, rather than judging behavior based upon stereotypes of race or age, we would move closer to a peaceful and just society. Critical race theories argue that changing stereotypes are important, but do not go far enough.CRTs argue racism and ageism arestructural, meaning cultural norms and historical practices (upstream factors) are the mechanisms by which economic, social, and political factors result in inequitable outcomes.They further argue thatresource hoardingis another important key mechanism to enduring inequityand until minoritized populations have equal access to education, affordable housing, healthcare, good jobs with pensions to build health and wealth, as well as time for leisure and retirement, we will continue to live in inequitable conditions. Interventions are needed at the structural level, not just the interpersonal level.A Multilevel Approach to Achieving EquityClearly, ending ageism is already a grand challenge unto itself. Folding in the objective to end racism is, admittedly, a herculean effort. Yet we argue the time is now. Efforts to end ageism and racism, as well as other forms of bias, have been siloed far too long. Oppression has many unique edges, but its roots and effects are commonly felt.So where to begin?Interpersonal Intergenerational InterventionsThere are many interpersonal intergenerational interventions that have proven to be effective at changing stereotypes, worldviews, and eliciting empathy (Burnes et al., 2019; Paluck et al., 2019). Changes in stereotypes often can be achieved within 8 hours total of face-to-face interaction. These interventions are low-cost, low-intensity, and low-commitment, and can be carefully designed via an intersectional lens for diverse communities nationwide. Vital Visionaries, for example, was one federally funded program by the National Institute on Aging (National Institutes of Health, 2006). The goal was to change medical students stereotypes toward older adults in the hopes that with a less ageist mindset, they would choose geriatric practice.Informed by the Contact Hypothesis by Gordon Allport (1954), medical students were paired with a healthy older adult at a local museum in several cities nationwide (Gonzales & Morrow-Howell, 2009). The dyads met for approximately 2 hours on a Saturday for 4 sessions. The pairs created art together and there was some time allotted for informal discussions to get to know one another. A quasi-experimental design resulted in medical students stereotypes shifting toward more neutral and positive assumptions about older adults (Gonzales et al., 2010).The majority of medical students said Vital Visionaries reinforced the idea of person-centered care, rather than operating from inaccurate stereotypes. Admittingly, we missed an opportunity to measure changes in stereotypical beliefs on race, ethnicity, and gender.Changing Stereotypes Through Social MediaWhile the Intergroup Contact Hypothesis has been effective at changing stereotypes with in-person interventions (Pettigew & Troop, 2006), the parasocial contact hypothesis (PCH) shows much promise to do the same but through social media.AtNew York Universitys (NYU) Center for Health and Aging Innovation (CHAI), we are exploring the use of social media to disrupt stereotypes toward older adults and aging. The (PCH) is an extension of Allports Contact Hypothesis and uses mediums such as social media, television, advertisements, and other forms of digital content. PCH suggests positive portrayals of minoritized individuals in virtual settings and mass media can reduce prejudice (Schiappa et al., 2005). When people form emotional bonds with characters, celebrities, and media representations, their view of the out group can alter if the characteristics do not align with their stereotypes (Lissitsa & Kushnirovich, 2021; Zickuhr & Madden, 2012). Parasocial contact has been shown to affect interpersonal relationships (Wong et al., 2022).Positive portrayals of minoritized individuals in virtual settings and mass media can likely reduce prejudice.It is hypothesized that the more varied visibility a community has representing a positive or neutral message (as opposed to negative portrayals only), the less stereotyping and discrimination it will encounter (Lissitsa & Kushnirovich, 2021). Importantly, producing media that portrays aging as solely a positive experience may establish a different set of unrealistic expectations (Halberstam, 1998).The PCH has informed CHAIs approach to social media. CHAIsInstagram,Facebook, andhomepagecreate virtual contact between intergenerational organizations locally and nationally. We identify and repost varied content (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, sexual and gender identification, activity portfolios) across platforms. Our aim is to portray various ways of aging that include sociodemographic identities and other personal characteristics. We also help disseminate news from other organizations that provide intergenerational programming in a weekly shout out.Increasing awareness of issues related to intersectional ageism + racism + sexism + isms aligns with our goal of decreasing discrimination at large. CHAI provides a new psychological framework for audiences to imagine, thereby subtly challenging viewers stereotypes and presenting new possibilities.In full transparency, our social media approach has not been tested.

Recruitment, training, supervision, acknowledgement, and ongoing supervision were institutional mechanisms that shaped the mentor-mentee relations. Importantly, volunteers who received a stipend committed to 15 hours per week, and research shows that stipended volunteers were more likely to complete the academic year when compared to those without stipends. The body of research on this high-intensity intergenerational tutoring program is compelling. Older volunteers, especially those who committed to higher levels of hours and months, showed reductions in depression, risk for falls, improved cognitive functioning, and reported higher levels of purpose and life satisfaction (Hong & Morrow-Howell, 2010; see alsoAARPs Impact Research). Childrens reading outcomes also improved with a volunteer (Gattis et al., 2010).Importantly, this intervention targeted reading and math comprehension at a sensitive developmental period, during second and third grade, which predicts attendance in and completion of high school. Positive outcomes also were identified in the families and neighbors of the older tutors (Morrow-Howell, et al., 2009). Clearly, this program is intergenerational, yet its focus is ensuring minoritized children have access to high quality education, while simultaneously improving various health dimensions among older minoritized adults. From a critical race perspective, this intergenerational program targets upstream factors: access to quality education and social resources that bolster health.NYUsintergenerational home-share program(CHAI at NYU), which matches adults ages 60 and older with graduate students in affordable, safe, and secure housing, is another example that looks at upstream factors. The benefits to emerging and older adults are compelling: increased housing and economic security, socialization, reduced financial stress and improved mental health (Gonzales, 2021; Gonzales et al., 2020).We intentionally recruit minoritized graduate students (i.e., first generation students, racial and ethnic minorities, international students) as well as minoritized older adults (i.e., women, racial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities). All good intentions aside, we quickly learned of many structural barriers, such as federal policy barriers pertaining to public benefits such as SSI, SNAP, Medicaid, and SCRIE (Gonzales, Levy, et al., 2021; Merz, Kruchten, & Gonzales, 2022). Policy advocacy efforts are necessary to address these issues of inclusion if we are to tackle the nations housing and affordability crises (Merz et al., 2022). We also learned that recruiting older adults was most effective, and cost the least, with social media as opposed to community listening sessions (Merz et al., 2023).ConclusionIntergenerational programs hold tremendous promise to achieve an equitable and peaceful society, in an ever-diversifying nation. The challenges facing us today are dynamic, situated in complex historical and political contexts. Many articles in this issue ofGenerations Journaldescribe powerful intergenerational programs that are happening nationwide. The challenge now is to organize ourselves, critically reflect upon various theoretical frameworks and interventions that show promise, be inclusive in the work, and advocate for changes to national policies. We hope the ideas in this article spark innovation, and that researchers, practitioners, funders, and policymakers are inspired to bring diverse generations together to achieve an equitable and peaceful society.Ernest Gonzales, PhD, MSSW, is the James Weldon Johnson Professor of Social Work at New York University, Silver School of Social Work.

He gets a mind-boggling amount done, and we got a peek into his methods working on this issue as he was incredibly organized and somehow always cheerfully responsive to queries.At New York University hes the James Weldon Johnson Professor of Social Work, Associate Professor of Social Work, and directs both the MSW program and The Center for Health and Aging Innovation at NYUs Silver School of Social Work. Gonzales also co-leads the American Academy of Social Work & Social Welfares Grand Challenge on Advancing Long, Healthy, and Productive Lives and is senior fellow of the NYU Aging Incubator.Essentially, he is doing everything he can in creative ways to foster intergenerational connection, working closely with Generations United and CoGenerate, both of which contributed to this issue filled with great ideas about how we might more productively engage elders with younger people, and keep elders gainfully involved in life and work.I am inspired by my students and colleagues who are driven to improve societyfor everyone, Gonzales said.Over the winter break, I had dinner with many friends and colleagues. An acquaintance reflected out loud at dinner: I dont think my kids are trying to make the world a better place theyre in finance. In that moment, I was again grounded in my career as an educator, researcher, advocate for healthy and productive aging. Im inspired by research findings and programs that demonstrate its possible to age well and in community.He is also a first-generation Latinx gerontologist whose early life experiences growing up in El Paso, Texas, with his loving maternal grandparents, parents, and uncles, inspired him to study how we age in a society that aspires for justice and equity but practices systemic racism, sexism, homophobia, and ageism.Proud to have received the James Weldon Johnson Professorship at NYU, Gonzales said Weldon Johnson was an important force for social justice during the Harlem Renaissance and served as Secretary to the NAACP. Being awarded this distinguished honor at NYU meant leadership recognized how I try to strive for equity and social justice as a gerontologist.Gonzales research has been supported by The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, National Institute on Aging, U.S. Social Security Administration, AARP Foundation, The Eisner Foundation, Fan Fox and Samuels Foundation and other public and private funders.Im inspired by research findings and programs that demonstrate its possible to age well and in community.He has served as content expert for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education and the National Science Foundation, as well as given testimony in the U.S. Senate on productive aging; debated paradigms on aging at The World Bank and given talks at leading institutions such as The United Nations, Harvard University, Stanford University, MIT, and others.Further academic accolades include the Peter T. Paul Career Development Award from Boston Universitys School of Social Work, where he was an assistant professor prior to NYU, and during his doctoral studies he received the Brown School of Social Works Dissertation Award and the Teaching Excellence Award for Doctoral Teaching Fellows, The John A. Hartford Pre-Dissertation Fellowship and Dissertation Fellowship, and the Washington University Chancellors Fellowship.He hopes this issue of Generations Journal, which is dedicated to promoting the health and well-being of a diverse society through productive activities for everyone, inspires ideas and daily practices on how to achieve such a healthy, peaceful, and cohesive society.All too often social structures segment populations (e.g., old vs. young, men vs. women) and its time we reorient ourselves and our social structures to be more fluid and inclusive, said Gonzales. This special issue tries to integrate the generations and various populations to promote health and social relations.Gonzales initial proposal to the Generations Journal Editorial Advisory Board panned out in the final product. As he said, All too often, systemic barriers undermine choices and opportunities for minoritized groups to be fully engaged in society. The authors of this special issue have a unique perspective on how to bring communities togethercommunities that are often pitted against each otherto solve societys most pressing issues such as academic achievement, housing and economic security, social connectedness and a strong sense of belonging through civic engagement and paid work. In so doing, they offer conceptual frameworks and real-world practices to promote health equity across diverse communities through a productive aging lens.The first half of the issue is devoted to intergenerational interventions and the second builds on research from the National Academies report, Understanding the Aging Workforce and Employment at Older Ages, bringing our attention to the growing diversity of the labor force and the challenges and opportunities in that diversity to promote health and work into later life.The challenge before us in the 21st century is to effectively bring diverse communities together in harmony to advance an equitable and peaceful society, said Gonzales.We hope these perspectives on productive aging inspire novel approaches to theory and practice to promote health and well-being for everyone.We certainly were inspired reading these pieces and hope you are, too.Alison Biggar is ASAs Editorial Director.Photo credit: Shutterstock/YavdatYou may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalWinter 202324Older Entrepreneurs: Unsupported Economic HeroesBy Cal J. HalvorsenFebruary 14, 2024TagsAgeism & CultureEconomic SecurityAbstract:Entrepreneurs are hailed as economic heroes and drivers of job growth. Yet an analysis of Current Population Survey data of U.S. residents between ages 5064 demonstrates that entrepreneurs disproportionately lack health insurance and workplace retirement savings program coverage. Finding that nearly 1 in 10 adults in this age range are self-employed, this study documents disparities by self-employment incorporation status, gender, and race and ethnicity. Using a financial capability perspective, program and policy actions to reduce these disparities are highlighted. If enacted, more entrepreneurship could be unlocked.Key Words:entrepreneurs, health insurance, workplace retirement savings programsEntrepreneurs are the stuff of lore: Hailed as economic heroes in the media, throughout the political spectrum, and in society at large, entrepreneurs are responsible for about 20% of job growth in the United States through the new businesses they create (Haltiwanger et al., 2013). The experience that comes with increased age may be a key component of an entrepreneurs success: the average age of the most successful entrepreneurs in the United States, measured by growth and business acquisition, is about 45 years old (Azoulay et al., 2020).Why Pursue Entrepreneurship in Later LifeAnd What Happens?The motivations to become an entrepreneur can be a mixed bag. Many are pulled into later-life entrepreneurship in pursuit of passions and to gain autonomy, flexibility, a sense of personal meaning, continued income, and a bridge to retirement (Halvorsen & Chen, 2019; Halvorsen & Morrow-Howell, 2017; Kautonen et al., 2014). However, people can also be pushed into later-life entrepreneurship due to unemployment or underemployment, stressful jobs, or a lack of career opportunities, often exacerbated by real or perceived age discrimination (Halvorsen & Morrow-Howell, 2017; Kautonen et al., 2014).Researchers have shown that while later-life entrepreneurs earn less income from work compared to their wage-and-salary counterparts, they may experience better health than those in wage-and-salary work (Zhang, 2014). Further, switching to entrepreneurship from wage-and-salary work after age 50 has been shown to improve quality of life and self-realization (Kautonen et al., 2017, 2023). Later-life entrepreneurs also can be good for the economy, in that they retire later, on average, than their wage-and-salary counterparts, contributing to the economy while delaying the claiming of Social Security and other pensions (Kautonen et al., 2023).However, later-life entrepreneurs in the United States do not reflect older adults overall, as they have higher levels of education and wealth, on average, and are less likely to be female, Black, or Hispanic than their wage-and-salary counterparts (Halvorsen, 2021). Further, entrepreneurs of all ages in the United States are less likely to have health insurance and to be saving for retirement (Jackson et al., 2017), highlighting a gap in the social safety net.Among adults ages 5064 in the U.S. between 2013 and 2022, fewer than 1 in 10 (8.9%) were self-employed.The classic image of an entrepreneurwith origins from the French word entreprendre, which means to undertake, and describing a person who innovates in pursuit of opportunities (Dees, 1998)differs widely from the lived experiences of many so-called entrepreneurs. Many applied scholars of entrepreneurship, myself included, prefer to use the term self-employment in our studies, as it describes those who work for themselves while removing difficult-to-measure concepts like innovation and opportunities from the definition and eliminating the mystique of the term entrepreneur.Using this simplified definition, it becomes possible to use large datasets to consider the unique experiences of self-employed individuals throughout the lifespan and by various demographic, social, and cultural attributes. Some datasets, such as the Current Population Survey, enable researchers to differentiate between two categories of self-employment: those who have incorporated their businesses (incorporated), and those who have not (unincorporated). This distinction is important, as the incorporated self-employedtechnically employees of their own businessesare about 3 times as likely to employ others and, among all self-employed workers with paid employees, hire nearly twice as many workers (Kochhar, 2014). Given that smaller businesses are less likely to offer benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022), this distinction also may highlight disparities in access to workplace benefits by incorporation status.Older Entrepreneurs Less Likely to Have Health Insurance and Retirement Savings PlansThis study examines the social protections of older entrepreneurs, documenting the labor-force status of older U.S. residents (ages 5064) who are not yet old enough to claim Medicare health insurance but are younger than traditional retirement age, while identifying disparities in health insurance and pension coverage by employment status, gender, and multiple ethnoracial identities. (Although there is no official retirement age in the United States, I use the term traditional retirement age65to indicate the age at which one traditionally received full Social Security benefits. This was prior to 1983, when Congress passed changes that have been gradually increasing the full retirement age [to age 67 by 2027].)I analyzed 10 years of pooled datafrom 2013 to 2022from the Current Population Survey of U.S. residents between ages 50 and 64, using data extracted from IPUMS (Flood et al., 2022). Ten years were chosen to create a sample size large enough to include additional ethnoracial groups often left out of reports, including American Indian and Alaska Natives (AIAN), Asian and Pacific Islanders (API), and those who identify as two or more races. (A note of caution: This time period includes good and bad economic times as well as a global pandemic. However, the benefits of this pooled approach include the inclusion of groups often left out of analyses and the averaging of effects through different economic periods.)Self-employed workers have lower rates of health insurance coverage and much lower rates of workplace retirement plan coverage.I used data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), which contained questions related to health insurance coverage (regardless of source) and retirement plan coverage through the workplace. Individual-level weights provided by IPUMS were used to increase the representativeness of the results to the larger U.S. population. The final dataset analyzed for this study included 326,741 observations within 161,348 unique workers.As shown in Figure 1, below, and among adults between ages 5064 in the United States between 20132022, fewer than 1 in 10 (8.9%) were self-employed, on average. Among those, unincorporated self-employment (5.3% of all adults ages 5064) was the most common, followed by incorporated self-employment (3.7%). Men were more likely work in both categories of self-employment than women.White adults had a similar unincorporated self-employment rate (5.6%) to Hispanic (5.5%), multiracial (5.5%), and API (5.4%) adults; these groups had an unincorporated self-employment at least twice that of Black adults. AIAN adults unincorporated self-employment rates fell in the middle (3.9%). White and API respondents had similar rates of incorporated self-employment (4.3% and 4.2%, respectively), with rates for all other ethnoracial groups ranging from 2.3% for multiracial adults to 0.9% for AIAN adults.Notes:Authors calculations using Current Population Survey data from 2013 to 2022 (Flood et al., 2022). SE = self-employment; AIAN = American Indian and Alaska Native; API = Asian and Pacific Islander. With the exception of the Hispanic category, all racial groups shown are not Hispanic.Figure 1, above, also highlights differences in labor force status by gender, where men were working for pay in either self-employment or wage-and-salary work at a rate of about 10 points higher than women (72.1% vs. 62.2%). Further, while nearly 7 in 10 API (69.5%) and White (68.8%) adults were working for pay, the rates were at least 10 points lower for Black (58.8%), multiracial (58.7%), and AIAN (50.8%) adults.Figure 2, below, displays health insurance coverage from any source (e.g., from the workplace, spouse, government, marketplace, etc.) among paid workers between ages 5064 between 2013 and 2022. Unincorporated self-employed adults were the least likely to have health insurance coverage (72.2%). Coverage rates were similar and more than 10 points higher for those working in incorporated self-employment (82%) and wage-and-salary work (84%).Notes: Authors calculations using Current Population Survey data from 2013 to 2022 (Flood et al., 2022). SE = self-employment; AIAN = American Indian and Alaska Native; API = Asian and Pacific Islander. With the exception of the Hispanic category, all racial groups shown are not Hispanic.In each of the three work categories, women had higher rates of health insurance than men. The biggest difference was between women and men who were in unincorporated self-employment (75.6% and 69.9%, respectively). Considering race and ethnicity and among unincorporated self-employed adults, White workers had the highest rate of health insurance coverage (74.7%), followed by API (74.3%), Black (68.7%), multiracial (66.5%), Hispanic (60%), and AIAN (43.6%) adults. AIAN adults were the least likely to have health insurance in all three of the labor force categories analyzed.As shown in Figure 3, below, just less than half (48%) of wage-and-salary employees were covered by a retirement plan through their work. Yet the rates were much lower for the self-employed, with just about one in five (22%) incorporated and one in 13 (7.7%) unincorporated self-employed covered by a retirement plan through their work.Notes: Authors calculations using Current Population Survey data from 2013 to 2022 (Flood et al., 2022). SE = self-employment; AIAN = American Indian and Alaska Native; API = Asian and Pacific Islander. With the exception of the Hispanic category, all racial groups shown are not Hispanic.Although similar, men had slightly higher rates of workplace retirement plan coverage than women among the three labor-force categories analyzed. Considering race and ethnicity, not more than 10% of unincorporated self-employed adults in any ethnoracial group were covered by a workplace retirement plan, ranging from 8.8% for White to 1.5% for AIAN adults.Among incorporated self-employed adults, AIAN adults had the highest rate of workplace retirement plan coverage (33.1%), followed by White (23.1%), API (21.1%), multiracial (19.8%), Black (15.4%), and Hispanic (13.8%) adults. Due to the smaller sample size, the AIAN estimate had a linearized standard error of .091, about twice that of the next closest group (multiracial, .047) and more than 5 times that of the third closest group (Black, .017); as such, these results should be interpreted with caution.Exposing DisparitiesAmongthe Self-EmployedAlthough the personal and societal benefits of self-employment have been well-documented, including various physical, psychosocial, and financial benefits (Halvorsen & Chen, 2019; Halvorsen & Morrow-Howell, 2017; Kautonen et al., 2014, 2017; Zhang, 2014) as well as job creation and later retirement ages (Haltiwanger et al., 2013; Kautonen et al., 2023), less attention has been paid to the downsides of self-employment.The results speak for themselves: Among adults past midlife who have not yet reached traditional retirement age and are too young for Medicare, self-employed workers have lower rates of health insurance coverage, particularly among the unincorporated, and much lower rates of workplace retirement plan coverage than those in wage-and-salary jobs. Here are the statistics:The unincorporated self-employed had rates of health insurance coverage 10 points lower than their incorporated peers (72.2% vs. 82%) and 12 points lower than those in wage-and-salary work (84%). Because benefits like health insurance and retirement savings programs are traditionally offered through the workplace in the United States, these statistics highlight the unaffordability of purchasing health insurance on the open market for older adults who, by law, can be charged up to three times more than younger adults (U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, n.d.).Additionally, few (7.7%) of the unincorporated self-employed were saving for retirement through their work, in comparison to nearly half (48%) of those in wage-and-salary work. And despite the fact that self-employed people may contribute to tax-advantaged retirement plans, such as Simplified Employee Pensions and solo-401(k)s (Internal Revenue Service, 2022), these results highlight how self-employed people in this study, despite being close to traditional retirement age, rarely save enough or at all (Kim et al., 2021). This may be because the self-employed do not benefit from many policies and incentives offered by many traditional employerspayroll deduction, matched contributions, automatic or required enrollmentthat have been shown to dramatically increase savings rates (Gale et al., 2020).Combined, this lack of benefits has led to what has been called entrepreneurship lockpeople choosing not to become self-employed so as not to lose important workplace-provided benefits (Fairlie et al., 2011).The entrepreneurship lock describes people choosing not to become self-employed so as not to lose workplace-provided benefits.Although older men were more likely to be self-employed than older women, health insurance and retirement plan coverage did not vary much by labor force status and gender. However, the results did identify disparities by ethnoracial group. AIAN, Black, and Hispanic adults had the three lowest rates of self-employment as well as overall labor force participation among the six groups analyzed. Among the unincorporated self-employed, these three groups also had the lowest health insurance and workplace retirement plan coverage. These findings echo broader disparities in health insurance coverage by race and ethnicity, although the Affordable Care Act has decreasedbut not eliminatedthese differences (Buchmueller & Levy, 2020). Further, scholars have documented how ethnoracial disparities in retirement savings plan coverage can be explained by key factors such as homeownership, objective financial knowledge, and financial planning horizon (i.e., the length of time one plans ahead for saving; Kim et al., 2021). Thus, these findings reflect larger health and economic disparities by race and ethnicity.Call to ActionA key segment of the American working populationthe self-employed, a word often used interchangeably with entrepreneursare often glorified as economic heroes. And in many ways, they arefor themselves, their families, and our economy. Yet this study identified two key areas in which we are not supporting these economic heroes: health insurance and retirement plan coverage.Using a financial capability perspective provides a useful framework for shaping program and policy actions moving forward. Financial capability, which addresses the structural barriers to both the ability and opportunity to act in ones best financial interests (Halvorsen & Skees, 2019), can have far-reaching consequences. As examples, financial literacy activities as well as behavioral economics techniques, such as prompts to save for retirement when filing tax returns (Grinstein-Weiss et al., 2017), which are targeted to self-employed people throughout the lifespan may reduce disparities in retirement saving.Yet a major reason for saving for retirement is because workplaces offer tax advantaged plans, often with a match. As such, IRAs sponsored by states or the federal government might increase the number of people saving for retirement who are not only self-employed, but also working in wage-and-salary roles without retirement plans (Belbase & Sanzenbacher, 2017). As of June 2023, auto-IRA programs have been enacted in 15 states, a good start (Georgetown Center for Retirement Initiatives, 2023). Given the variation between these state-led initiatives, researchers should evaluate them to identify factors that increase savings the most among the self-employed while decreasing disparities by race, ethnicity, gender, incorporation status, and more.Separately, it is concerning that so many people later in life, at a time when chronic disease rates increase, are not covered by health insurance. This despite the laudable gains made in health insurance coverage due to the Affordable Care Act (Buchmueller & Levy, 2020). Because the unincorporated self-employed are specifically at risk, particularly among racial and ethnic minority populations who also have a higher chronic disease burdens (Quiones et al., 2019), more emphasis needs to be placed on linking individuals to health insurance subsidies, if eligible, while creating policies that aim to create more universal coverage. One option, for example, is to reduce the age of Medicare eligibility for everyone (Song, 2020). Or, via a more politically fraught yet clearly effective means, enact policies that move toward universal healthcare, unlocking entrepreneurial opportunities for people across the lifespan (Fairlie et al., 2011).Cal J.

BrooksDecember 06, 2023TagsJustice & EquityEconomic SecurityHealth & Well-beingAbstract:As Black Americans age, the impact of structural long-term economic racism and health disparities converge to offer a dismal outlook for their final years. Black older adults are sicker and more vulnerable to chronic diseases and illnesses than are older White Americans. This health crisis comes to a head at a critical time: when they are most vulnerable financially, with low incomes and heavily dependent upon Social Security. This article examines the historical roots of todays racial disparities in health and finances and proposes solutions such as housing assistance and greater access to healthcare to improve outcomes.Key Words:ageism, discrimination, finance, healthcare, racism, Social SecurityAs Black Americans age, the impact of structural long-term economic racism and health disparities converge to offer a dismal outlook for their final years.Black older adults are sicker and more vulnerable to chronic diseases and illnesses than are older White Americans (CIGNA, 2014). This health crisis comes to a head at a critical time: when they are most vulnerable financially, with low incomes and heavily dependent upon Social Security.These disparities were highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Black Americans suffered disproportionately both economically and in terms of health. Many deaths during the pandemic were related to pre-existing chronic conditions. The impact of COVID was so strong that life expectancy of Black and Latino Americans dropped by three to four times that for Whites in the United States (Andrasfay & Goldman, 2021).As with most economic downturns, Black Americans in 2020 were less prepared fiscally and were impacted to a greater extent. They faced a sharp rise in unemployment and wage loss due to the pandemic, which had a big impact on their savings habits (Edwards & Lopez, 2021). They also were concentrated in low-pay service jobs, which put them on the frontlines during the pandemic (Pryor & Tomaskovic-Devy, 2020). Historically, they have hadlower savings and lower net worththan White Americans (Moss et al., 2020).The strains brought by the pandemic only added to the stress already carried from enduring decades of racism, and its impact on the mental and physical health of Black Americans. Per the American Psychological Association (2018), Exposure to cumulative experiences of racism has resulted in limited access to resources such as education, employment, health care, housing, and political participation, contributing to health disparities and increased rates of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and dementia (para. 5).This is compounded by structural ageism and ableism, which result in older and disabled Black Americans exclusion from social activities; difficulty accessing healthcare, community services, and other vital supports; and discriminatory policies.Black Elders and the Racial Wealth GapIf youre the average Black person in America and you cant participate in wealth generating activities because of the system, when you get to retirement youre not going to have as much wealth, said Gary Cunningham, former CEO of Prosperity Now. Even in the middle class, Blacks don't have as much wealth for retirement as the dominant group because there are generational transfers that occur as well (G. Cunningham, personal communication, May 9, 2023).In Black households headed by someone between the ages of 55 and 64, median total assets in 2019 were $54,530, compared with $383,900 for White households in the same age group (Black Wealth Data Center, n.d.).One-third of older Black couples and nearly two-thirds of unmarried Black elders rely upon Social Security for nearly all of their income (National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare [NCPSSM], 2022).The median White family has 10 times the wealth of the median Black family; Black Americans earn $1 million less than White Americans in their lifetimes (Noel et al., 2019).While Black older adults make up 9% of the older adult population, they represent 21% of those older adults living below the federal poverty level, and the poverty rate for Black elders in the United States is more than twice the rate for all elders (Diverse Elders Coalition, n.d.).Our economic structures sideline elders and people with disabilities due to misconceptions about their capability, which particularly impacts people of color.Our economic structures also sideline older people and people with disabilities due to misconceptions about their capability. This particularly impacts people of color, as they are disproportionately represented in low-wage work that often requires physical strength (19.2% of Latinx and 14.3% of Black workers vs. 8.6% of White workers; Cooper, 2018).As a result of these inequities, Black Americans earn less, save less, and are ill-prepared for retirement.Forty percent of U.S. households are expected to run out of money in retirement, and that number jumps to well over 50% for Black Americans (Groves, 2023).Only 50% of Black Americans are covered by a retirement plan, compared to 60% of White Americans (John et al., 2022). Black individuals are heavily concentrated in low-paying and part-time jobs that dont offer retirement plans.Structural Racism Robbed Blacks of Homes and PropertyBetween segregation, redlining, and outright racism, Black Americans have been prevented from creating generational wealth through homeownership via laws and policies by local, state, and federal governments and businesses. Race riots in Tulsa, OK, and dozens of other American cities left once-thriving Black communities damaged and destroyed by angry White mobs.Black World War II veterans were denied benefits awarded to White veterans, including Veterans Administration mortgage loans and other housing assistance, educational assistance, and health benefits. The loss of generational housing wealth of these Black veterans is incalculable.Social SecurityWhite families have about 6 times more in average retirement savings than do Black families, because workers with lower earnings have a harder time saving.The average White male earns $2.7 million over a lifetime, while the average Black male earns $1.8 million. Social Security is crucial for Black women, who typically live longer than Black men (NCPSSM, 2022). The average Social Security income in 2019 for Black men ages 65 and older was $14,409, compared to $12,806 for Black women in the same age group (Social Security Administration, 2021).The convergence of these issues is particularly devastating for Black women. They earn about $1 million less than White men over their careers (National Womens Law Center [NWLC], 2021). They are more likely to sacrifice employment to serve as care providers for spouses or children. Also, their jobs are concentrated in the low-paying service industry without pensions or other retirement savings (Frye, 2021). And because Social Security payments are based on wage history, Black women end up with lower monthly checks.According to NWLC (2021), Between 2014 and 2018, nearly one in four (22%) Black women in the U.S. lived in poverty, and Black mothers are only paid 50 cents of every dollar paid to white fathers. Moreover, Black women are more likely than white women to be the primary breadwinners for their families, which impacts their ability to build wealth and savings. As a result, Black families are more vulnerable to ageist and ableist structural barriers to employment and healthcare, often passed over by employers, and have a higher rate of disability, due to lack of access to medical care.As Black women age, they are more likely to age alone with low income and burgeoning health issues. They have limited access to medical care and high-cost drugs. They increasingly will face discrimination related to race, age, gender, and disability (White, 2023).Black Elders and the Racial Health GapA major concern is that older Black Americans face declining physical and mental health and increased isolation and loneliness when they are also crippled by low or no income and reduced Social Security payments.Black elders are at higher risk for heart diseases, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza, and pneumonia, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS compared to White Americans, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health (OMH, 2021).By the time you get to 65, you've had a chronic illness for 40 plus years, as opposed to if you start in your late 40s, early 50s.Time does not equal progress, said Dr. Keith C. Ferdinand, professor of medicine at the Tulane University School of Medicine. Life expectancy has gradually increased over the last several decades for all Americans. But there's a persistent White-Black mortality gap. And its primarily driven by cardiovascular disease (K. Ferdinand, personal communication, May 12, 2023).Health issues are more problematic for Blacks because they suffer from comorbiditieshypertension, diabetes, kidney disease at a younger age, said Dr. Celia Maxwell, associate dean of research at the Howard University College of Medicine. If you're starting to have these chronic diseases and you are diagnosed earlier, when youre ages 20 to 49, obviously, by the time you get older, youre in worse shape, just because you have had these comorbidities so much longer, she added. By the time you get to 65, youve had a chronic illness for 40 plus years, as opposed to if you start in your late 40s, early 50s. (C. Maxwell, personal communication, May 2, 2023).Those problems manifest themselves in the already fragile health of Black Americans, which progressively worsens as they age.Nearly 4 in 10 Black men ages 18 or older have high blood pressure, a rate 30% higher than that of White men; Black mens risk of a stroke is twice that of White men (OMH, 2023b, 2023c). For Black women, 45% of those ages 18 and older have high blood pressure, arate 60% higher than White women (Mieres, n.d.).Black women are 41% more likely to die of breast cancer than White women (American Cancer Society, 2022, p. 15).Black men in 1990 had a 47% higher cancer death rate than White men, which by 2016 dropped to a 19% higher death rate (American Cancer Society, 2019).Black Americans are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than Whites, and nearly twice as likely to be hospitalized (OMH, 2023a).Blacksare more than twice as likely as Whitesto suffer from Alzheimer's and other kinds of dementia (Steenhuysen, 2023).The impact of COVID in the Black community is long term. One of the effects of the pandemic is that cardiovascular mortality is worsening among Black Americans (K. Ferdinand, personal communication, May 12, 2023).The Impact of Structural Racism on the Health of Black Older AdultsI think a good deal of [poor health outcomes for older Black Americans] is attributed to systematic racism, said Maxwell. Some of it might be attributed to genetics. But even with genetics, if you get consistently good care, you mitigate some of the bad outcomes. So implicit bias and racism plays a role also. You're getting sick with chronic illnesses earlier.Obviously some of it is due to lifestyleyour diet is poor, she added. But you live in a food desert, really no supermarkets. What you usually have is these little corner markets. Its mostly pre-packaged, sodium, high sugar, high-fat foods.So now we've seen some youngsters 15, 16, 17 with hypertension, obesity, with early diabetes, said Maxwell. That should not happen. (C. Maxwell, personal communication, May 2, 2023).Black Americans face more lifetime stress than White Americans because of racial inequality and discrimination. Theyre more likely to prematurely lose close family members, including children. Losing a child by age 40 increases the risk of developing dementia, which Blacks already face a higher risk of developing compared to Whites (Umberson et al., 2019). By the time Black Americans turn 60, they are 90% more likely than their White peers to experience at least four deaths of family (Stern, 2017).HealthcareMistrust of health professionals runs deep in the Black community. The medical community has a long history of mistreating Black Americansfrom experiments on enslaved people to the forced sterilizations of Black women and the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study, in which treatment was withheld from hundreds of unknowing Black men for decades so doctors could track the course of the disease (Horstman et al., 2022).If you were Black, in the 40s or early 50s, you really couldn't see a dentist in many communities unless this dentist was Black, said Maxwell (personal communication, [May 2, 2023]). Do you know who they would send you to? The veterinarian. So, the distrust of healthcare stems from a lot of things including memories of abusiveness.Maxwell said the same communities that dont have supermarkets also dont have decent healthcare. So, it's multifactorial, she added. It has to do with implicit bias, some racism, theres some unequal provision of services, particularly if people are Black or brown and your provider is not. He or she can't understand your particular circumstance. Seniors as a whole have a harder burden to bear and seniors of color particularly have a big burden (C. Maxwell, personal communication, [May 2, 2023]).Regina Koepp, a geropsychologist based in Atlanta, GA, wrote that the stress Black Americans experience as a result of racism is associated with mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, insomnia, and other serious conditions such as post-traumatic stress and substance use disorders: Its essential that aging, health care, and mental health providers strive for greater awareness and training to properly address race-related stress and the toll racism takes on African American older adults (Koepp, 2020).New drugs appear to improve the ability to survive diabetes, but they can cost up to $8,000 a year.A recent study on disability, race, and ethnicity said that 1 in 4 members of the Black community have a disability (Slayter, 2021). And there are questions about doctor training and clinical drug trials being overwhelmingly tilted to Whites. A New York Times story examined how dermatologists are trained to diagnose problems with White skin, which often look different on dark skin (Rabin, 2020). And Black women say they are often dismissed or ignored by medical care providers (Washington et al., 2022).The serious health problems faced by tennis champ Serena Williams after the birth of her first child and the death of three-time Olympic medalist Tori Bowie from complications of childbirth put in sharp relief the harsh realities facing Black women at childbirth. Three out of the four women who ran the 4 X 100 relay in the Rio De Janeiro Olympics had life-threatening pregnancies, according to Bowies teammates Allyson Felix and Tianna Bartoletta Madison (Cohen & Cash, 2023).Black and Latino older adults also said they commonly experienced racial discrimination and bias in the U.S. Healthcare system, according to the Commonwealth Fund. The findings highlight the dual challenges of racism and ageism these individuals face in getting the medical attention they need (Horstman et al., 2022).Social IsolationSocial isolation leads to a host of health-related issues for all older adults, but especially Blacks. Ferdinand said that a lack of adequate transportation affects access to health services and healthy foods: Those patients with limited means and with social isolation are more prone to cardiovascular risk, are less able to get access to appropriate healthcare, or even preventive care, access heart healthy diet, fresh fruits, vegetables, new sources of protein (K. Ferdinand, personal communication, May 12, 2023).Black people, especially older Black people, are relegated to poor, high-crime metropolitan areas due to decades of redlining, cycles of poverty, and a long history of segregation. Additionally, older Blacks who live in isolation or in neighborhoods where safety is a concern will not be able to maintain physical activity.Drug PricesDrug prices often put treatment out of reach for low-income Americans, especially poor Black elders. New drugs appear to improve the ability to survive diabetes, but they can cost more than $11,000 a year (Amin et al., 2023). New medications for heart disease can cost more than $4,000 a year (Hirschler, 2015). The high cost is a barrier. So now, the White-Black mortality gap is not potentially improved but may even widen (K. Ferdinand, personal communication, May 12, 2023).Also, there are few Blacks in clinical trials. ProPublica found that in trials for 24 of 32 cancer drugs approved by the FDA since 2015, fewer than 5% of the patients were Black, though they make up 13.4% of the U.S. population (Chen & Wong, 2018). That leaves questions as to whether the drugs are as effective in Black patients or if there are more or different side effects.Protect Our Care (2021), an organization dedicated to making affordable and equitable healthcare available for all, said 30% of people who take prescription drugs struggle to pay for them. The burden is especially heavy for those earning less than $40,000 per year, whose medication costs are greater than $100 per month. These factors disproportionately impact Black Americans, who are more likely to require medications for chronic health conditions, while simultaneously earning household median incomes nearly $30,000 less than White counterparts, the report said (Protect Our Care, 2021).Helping Older Black Americans Face These ChallengesHousing assistance, financial assistance programs, and improving access to healthcare and education, as well as increasing in-home elder care, can help solve some of the issues. Programs to help eradicate housing discrimination, age discrimination, and discrimination against people with disabilities would also help.But, as with all the racial health and wealth gap issues, some of the surest solutions involve government programs and government fundingwhich may be difficult to find in todays atmosphere of political polarization.Maintaining the status quo translates into another 200 years before African Americans have the same level of wealth as their white counterparts, said the Center for American Progress. The Black-white wealth gap is a product of intentional systematic policy choices. The only way to correct this wrong is to make intentional systematic changes in response (Hanks et al., 2018).Rodney A. Brooks is an award-winning journalist who writes about retirement and racial health and wealth disparities. He has written for many publications, includingUSA TODAY, The Washington PostandNational Geographic,and is the author ofFixing the Racial Wealth Gap: Racism and Discrimination Put Us Here, But This Is How We Can Save Future Generations(August Press, 2022).Photo credit: Shutterstock/BricolageReferencesAmerican Cancer Society.

WilderDecember 06, 2023TagsJustice & EquityHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureAbstract:Women disproportionately experience medical gaslighting, especially older women, women with disabilities, and women of color. This article explores the challenges older women, particularly those with disabilities, encounter in obtaining respectful healthcare.It focuses on medical gaslighting, or the dismissal of these elders medical issues as imaginary or resulting from mental health issues.It also covers denial of care, minimizing or ignoring physical signs of illness, and paternalization, as well as the potential of the disability justice movement to improve outcomes.Key Words:ableism, ageism, disability justice, sexism, medical gaslighting, racism, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue SyndromeMedical Gaslighting: A Personal JourneyLiving with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) has been a battle with intermittent relief (see CDC, 2021, to learn more about ME/CFS;https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html). It affects my entire body and takes up space in my everyday existence. ME/CFS is recognized as a neurological disease by the World Health Organization but gets very little, if any, respect in society and medical circles.As a 56-year-old woman with a background in public policy and social services (co-author Terri Wilder), my journey with ME/CFS has intertwined with systemic challenges that have affected me professionally and personally. My struggle with ME/CFS has been a long one, spanning decades before receiving a formal diagnosis. Throughout this time, the symptoms and their impact on my daily life were ever present, yet unexplained. Unrefreshing sleep, cognitive dysfunction, pain, sensitivity to light and sound, disabling fatigue, poor temperature regulation, and chemical sensitivities were all part of the laundry list of symptoms that disrupted my life. Other common occurrences: shame, misunderstanding, and disbelief.But in March 2016, my life changed when I received the diagnosis validating that what I had been experiencing was real. I was one of the lucky ones. I was diagnosed by an ME/CFS clinical expert. Not only did this diagnosis help me understand what was going on with my body, it also gave me the opportunity to try potential treatments and connect with #MEAction (https://www.meaction.net/), an international organization that fights for recognition, education, and research so that people with ME/CFS will have support and access to compassionate and effective care. Through #MEAction I have met hundreds, if not thousands, of people across the globe with the same disease.During my first year of diagnosis, I was terrified. I told only a few people. I naively believed that having a job, insurance, stable housing, and identifying as a white person would provide some level of protection against the challenges of living with ME/CFS. However, I soon realized that my privileges did not exempt me from the disbelief and dismissive attitudes I encountered in society that would ultimately prevent me from ever finding an approved treatment to get me back to the life I wanted, free from symptoms.While my privileges granted me access to certain medical resources and opportunities, they did not shield me from the impact of medical gaslighting and the subsequent struggles I faced when seeking understanding and comprehensive care for my disease. The assumption that privileges, like insurance and socioeconomic stability, would automatically result in better treatment and validation proved to be inconsistent.Medical gaslighting, a phenomenon in which a medical provider dismisses or downplays a persons symptoms, or attributes them to something else, such as a psychiatric illness, became a disheartening reality during my encounters with healthcare professionals, including one dismissive cardiologist. While more likely to happen to people who identify as women, gaslighting is an experience shared by many people of color, older women, and women with disabilities.This experience shed light on the systemic biases and discriminatory practices that persist in healthcare and in our society at large. It became evident that the disbelief and medical gaslighting faced by individuals with ME/CFS were not solely a result of individual circumstances but deeply rooted in broader societal structures that perpetuate ableism, sexism, racism, and ageism, and marginalize those who have chronic diseases and disabilities.Experiencing medical gaslighting highlighted the urgent need in healthcare systems for awareness, empathy, and education about disabilities.I vividly remember my cardiology appointment. I proactively scheduled it due to concerns about a family history of heart issues and my understanding of my disease's inflammatory nature, which could potentially put me at risk for cardiac issues. All went well at the beginning of my appointment. It was when I shared my ME/CFS diagnosis that the tone and behavior of the cardiologist shifted, and she proceeded to make dismissive remarks, implying that ME/CFS was not a real disease.Her lack of understanding about the disease was evident when she told me that my problem was lack of exercise, without even considering the debilitating consequences that could occur from even a small amount of exertion for someone with ME/CFS (CDC, 2021). When it was obvious that there was no point in staying any longer, I abruptly ended the appointment. I called the next day to complain about my experience and referred the practice manager to a free ME/CFS medical-education course for the clinic. The response? She asked if I was trying to get the physician fired.The experience of medical gaslighting highlighted for me the urgent need in healthcare systems for awareness, empathy, and education about disabilities. It exposed the biases and disbelief that individuals with ME/CFS and other disabilities often face, which hinder their access to appropriate care and perpetuate feelings of invalidation, neglect, and erasure.I made an appointment with another cardiologist who listened to me without judgement, did a thorough exam, and set up a battery of tests. But what if I had not had the resources to set up another appointment and remained defeated by the experience I had just encountered?The impact of ME/CFS on a persons quality of life and the need to be listened to about that lived experience cannot be overstated. The fluctuating nature of the disease, along with its wide range of symptoms, significantly disrupts a persons quality of life, relationships, and career aspirations. This is why believing people and doing everything possible to provide the most compassionate, comprehensive care is important. Medical gaslighting is harmful. It is hurtful. It can even be deadly.The publics disbelief surrounding ME/CFS poses additional challenges. The often-hidden nature (stnkaya & Machin, 2021) of the disease, which can lack visible signs of disability (Paul, 2020); false narratives; and stereotypes about who gets the disease lead to invalidation and skepticism. Family and friends may struggle to recognize or understand the complexities of the disease. And when healthcare professionals fail to recognize the disease as valid, it can result in misdiagnosis or a failure to offer appropriate care and referrals. Furthermore, the lack of specific diagnostic tests for ME/CFS, along with the paucity of ME/CFS experts available in the United States (Dimmock et al., 2018), adds to the difficulty of receiving a timely and accurate diagnosis.Of course, mine is just one story among thousands. In the community of people living with ME/CFS, medical gaslighting is a regular occurrence. It is a frequent topic of conversation in support groups, closed Facebook groups, and conferences. These conversations are always predictable yet bathed in frustration. Sadly, medical gaslighting is often considered a rite of passage in our community and it is felt that a person has not fully lived with the disease until they have experienced it.Medical GaslightingHistoryCo-author Wilders arduous journey to gain respect for her symptoms, a diagnosis, and appropriate care shows the toll taken by medical providers who routinely dismiss womens symptoms as resulting from stress, depression, or a belief that it is just all in her head. This is a problem most women face at some point, but it is particularly common for older women and women with disabilities, whose symptoms are often attributed to natural life changes or attention seeking, and in other marginalized communities for different reasons, such as assumptions that Black women are drug-seeking (Spencer & Grace, 2016).In the community of people living with ME/CFS, medical gaslighting is a regular occurrence.Medical gaslighting has a long history. For about as long as medicine has been practiced, womens medical complaints that were poorly understood were dismissed as hysteria (King, 1998). By the early 20th century, hysteria was used to explain any symptoms women described that were not easily diagnosed. Still today, women suffering from illnesses that mainly or only affect women are more likely than not to be told that their physical symptoms are the result of stress, family issues, sexual dysfunction, or depression, and sent home with a prescription for an antidepressant, or no treatment at all. For older women, this is true even for symptoms of illness more common among older people of all genders, such as cancer and cardiac disease (Dusenbery, 2018).PrevalenceMedical gaslighting is not a rare problem or one confined to a few, poorly understood diseases. A recent survey of women revealed that a staggering 72% of respondents had experienced it (Castleberry, 2022). Their experiences included being ignored and dismissed, stereotyped, blamed, and, most often, told their physical symptoms were caused by psychological problems. The effects of ageism and ableism are clear when we note that older women and those with disabilities are more likely to have their symptoms dismissed or stereotyped (Jerome, 2022).Women have difficulty obtaining treatment even for diseases that are major causes of death in the United States. In one survey, 44% of women with cardiac disease reported that their healthcare provider downplayed their symptoms or attributed them to psychological causes (Dusenbery, 2017). A study of physicians in which they were presented with hypothetical patients reporting the same risk factors and symptoms of heart disease, differentiated only by gender, found that only 15% of the doctors diagnosed coronary disease in the women, compared with 56% in the men (Chiaramonte & Friend, 2006). There is a similar disparity in the diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the fourth most common cause of death in the United States, among women and men. Again, presented with hypothetical patients with identical clear symptoms of COPD, physicians diagnosed it in 65% of the men and only 49% of the women.For diseases that are difficult to diagnose, have wide-ranging symptoms, and depend upon patients reports of their experience rather than objective tests, the ability for women to obtain appropriate care is much more difficult. Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and diseases that are poorly understood, including ME/CFS and chronic Lyme, are commonly ascribed to psychological disorders or personal life issues for women (Moyer, 2022). One could say that psychologizing womens physical symptoms is almost a default reaction.ConsequencesThe results of the failure to accurately diagnose womens illness are dire. Women wait longer for treatment of serious disease, including heart disease and cancer, are more often sent home from emergency rooms while having a heart attack, and particularly for Black women, take longer to receive pain medication while suffering severe pain (Hoffman et al., 2016).One result is that men are about twice as likely to be diagnosed, treated, and referred to a specialist when visiting hospital rooms while experiencing cardiac arrest (Chiaramonte & Friend, 2006). While more difficult to quantify, it is well known that the best outcome for many diseases, such as cancer, stroke, and autoimmune disease, depends upon rapid treatment.According to The American Autoimmune Association, on average it takes four years and four medical providers to obtain a diagnosis(Autoimmune Association, 2023). Sadly, many women are only able to obtain care when significant damage has been done.For many diseases that are poorly understood, women may never find adequate care. It is estimated that 31% of women who experience gaslighting ultimately stop seeking treatment (Castleberry, 2022).Fundamentally, ignoring, downplaying, and dismissing womens medical symptoms is dehumanizing. The essential denial of the individuals reality can cause self-doubt, which can lead to depression, anxiety, and stress, the very conditions the medical provider tried to palm off on the person initially (Jerome, 2022). It is worth remembering that the term gaslighting originated in a stage play about a mans attempts to have his wife judged insane.Structural BasisAt this point we should note that gaslighting of older women does not occur because men do not listen to women. In fact, as Wilders experience demonstrates, gaslighting is not perpetrated only by male practitioners. Repeated studies have shown that men and women are equally likely to miss obvious medical diagnoses in women and to trivialize or psychologize their symptoms (Dusenbery, 2018).Medical gaslighting of older women has structural causes. The characterization of women as unreliable and untrustworthy is essential to maintaining the historical male dominance of inheritance, control of family, and power in society. But in the medical and disability context, there are specific structures in the way medicine has developed and in the relationship between the medical provider and patient that lead to the common dismissal of womens experiences.Medicine has historically been, as Maya Dusenbery puts it, by men, for men. Until the early 1990s, there was no requirement that women be included in medical studies or trials, and generally they were not, even for diseases that primarily affect women, such as breast cancer (Dusenbery, 2018; Mazure & Jones, 2015).Since 1977, the Federal Drug Administration prohibited women of childbearing potential from participating in medical studies, which resulted in many researchers excluding all women (Merton, 1993). Other researchers argued that womens hormonal profile could alter clinical trial outcomes, without considering that, if true, this would be critical information to have when treating women.Only 15% of doctors diagnosed coronary disease in the women in the study, compared with 56% in the men.The National Institutes of Health mandated in the early 1990s the inclusion of women in studies it funds. However, research indicates that women remain grossly under-represented, and that the situation is not improving (Merton, 1993). Still today, almost no studies include people older than age 65, leading to a dearth of understanding of the health of older women (Dusenbery, 2018).The exclusion of women from research has resulted in a lack of understanding of many diseases from the female perspective. During the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, women were largely excluded or underrepresented in clinical trials and research studies. This lack of gender-specific data and insights in HIV research has led to suboptimal treatment plans and prevention strategies for women, hindering effective efforts to combat HIV. Similarly, a comparable issue emerged with heart disease, where the recognition of different symptoms in women did not occur until the early 2000s (Keteepe-Arachi & Sharma, 2017). Unfortunately, even today, many emergency personnel dismiss womens less definitive symptoms of cardiac arrest, contributing to a higher female mortality rate (Heart Matters, n.d.).Additionally, conditions that primarily affect men are more likely to attract research funding than those that affect women. For example, five times more funding is devoted to erectile dysfunction, which affects 19% of men, than to dysmenorrhea, from which 90% of women suffer to some extent (Jerome, 2022).Another structural framework that disadvantages women in medical settings is our understanding of the sick role, or how sick people should behave (Parsons, 1951). For society to recognize that someone is ill and allowed to avoid the economic and productive burdens of social life, they must conform to the sick role, by withdrawing from public and productive activity and following all advice in pursuit of a cure. What that line of thinking does not allow is feeling okay some days and not others, as with ME/CFS, chronic Lyme disease, or Long COVID, or failing to pursue prescribed but unhelpful therapies. As many diseases that primarily affect women do not conform to this role, they are not considered real diseases.The structures of ageism also contribute to failures to respond respectfully and effectively to womens reports of illness. The most obvious example is the emphasis on youthful appearance, often focusing on weight. While weight bias affects larger people of all genders and ages, patient surveys reveal that older women are commonly told that their chronic pain, fatigue, and other physical symptoms would resolve if they lost weight. Conversely, older women who report unexplained weight loss are often congratulated, rather than queried about other symptoms and possible causes (Dusenbery, 2018)Other structural barriers to obtaining comprehensive care for illnesses that disproportionately affect older women are cost, financial challenges, and demands on their time. Women make up most of the uninsured adults (Dusenbery, 2018). Even with insurance, poorer women often must rely upon providers with larger patient loads and less time allotted to each patient, which encourages a tendency to find an easy explanation requiring little of the medical providers attention. Women are less likely to own a car and thus have more difficulty getting to medical appointments and are more likely to be working later in life in jobs without much paid time off and to be a caretaker for relatives (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2022).These structural issues will not be resolved by educating healthcare providers to respond more empathetically to womens reports. What is needed is more aggressive and concerted funding for research into diseases affecting primarily women, based upon studies of women. This will not happen without more attention from regulatory and funding agencies and legislation mandating it.Response: Disability JusticeAddressing medical gaslighting, along with ageism and gender bias in medicine, requires a comprehensive approach that combines personal storytelling with broader policy advocacy efforts. Disability Justice, founded by Black and Brown Queer people, provides the transformative framework needed to challenge and dismantle the intersecting oppressions faced by individuals with disabilities (Sins Invalid, 2020). It recognizes that disability cannot be separated from other social identities such as race, gender, class, age, and sexuality. By centering the experiences and voices of disabled individuals, Disability Justice challenges the power dynamics and oppressive systems that perpetuate medical gaslighting and disbelief.Within Disability Justice, intersectionality plays a crucial role (Crenshaw, 2016). It acknowledges that disability intersects with other forms of oppression, and the experiences of disabled individuals are shaped by multiple identities. By recognizing the unique challenges faced by disabled individuals from marginalized communities, Disability Justice highlights the need for inclusive and equitable healthcare practices.At the core of Disability Justice is the principle of collective liberation. Collective liberation poses the question, How do we move together? This principle emphasizes the importance of unity and solidarity across diverse identities, including abilities, race, gender, class, age, and sexual orientation, leaving no body or mind behind in the pursuit of liberation (People & Planet, n.d.). By embracing collective liberation, Disability Justice seeks to create a society where all individuals, regardless of their abilities, can thrive and contribute.It is imperative to acknowledge that the future is inherently disabled, as disability is an intrinsic aspect of the human condition. Embracing a Disability Justice framework while responding to medical gaslighting not only amplifies the voices and experiences of individuals with disabilities but also underlines the urgency of dismantling ableist structures within society. Just as Disability Justice advocates for collective liberation, it reminds us that our struggles for equity are interconnected and interdependent. By recognizing the intersectionality of discrimination, we can build solidarity among all marginalized communities and work together to challenge medical gaslighting and dismantle oppressive systems.Through these collective efforts, we pave the way for a truly inclusive and equitable society where every individual can fully participate and thrive and receive the healthcare services they need and deserve.Rani Kronick is an independent scholar with a long history in the disability movement, based in upstate New York.

Manalel & Mark Brennan-IngDecember 06, 2023TagsJustice & EquityHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureAbstract:Older women living with HIV are an especially vulnerable population due to their experience of multiple stigmas resulting from intersectional identities. Using an intersectional convoy model to conceptualize social relations, we consider how HIV-related stigma, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic position shape access to support resources through personal networks. We briefly review existing research on how intersecting identities and structural inequities might influence the structure, composition, and function of support networks among older people with HIV. Potential applications of the intersectional convoy model and implications for research and practice are discussed.Key Words:HIV, gender, isolation, race and ethnicity, stigma, support networksIntegration within supportive social networks is widely considered to be a key component of healthy aging and essential for older adults health and well-being. Efforts to identify protective factors, such as support networks, and the mechanisms whereby they promote healthy aging among people living with HIV (PLWH) are increasingly important as this population grows worldwide. Though nascent, there is a growing body of work focused on the structural and functional aspects of social ties among people aging with HIV. Social support is a protective factor against many negative consequences of HIV, as it can buffer against HIV stigma (Emlet, 2006a), and it is associated with a number of health-promoting behaviors among PLWH, including care engagement and medication adherence (Chandran et al., 2019). Thus, it is important to understand the factors that shape older PLWHs access to and use of informal support resources.Stigma double jeopardy.Decades of research have highlighted the effects of HIV stigma on social relations. Aging with HIV represents a double stigma (Emlet, 2006b), whereby risk of social isolation is exacerbated by the lack of social support and internalization of harmful ageist stereotypes (e.g., loneliness being an inevitable part of aging), as well as structural ableism. Structural ableism related to HIV serostatus can range from discrimination and lack of access to services to more serious human rights infringements, such as criminalization based on HIV status. Emlet (2006b) found that most older PLWH experience ageism and ableist HIV-related stigma, which intersect in their reports of rejection, stereotyping, and social isolation.Older PLWH may be more socially isolated and have smaller social networks for several reasons (Poindexter & Shippy, 2008; Shippy & Karpiak, 2005). Disclosure of HIV status can result in the loss of important social ties, like family relationships or embeddedness in communities, which contributes to social isolation among PLWH. Stigma may discourage people from disclosing their serostatus and seeking support, which are socially isolating experiences. However, PLWH demonstrate resilience in adapting their networks to meet social needs. In terms of social network composition, friends or families of choice have long been considered a staple of PLWHs social networks, particularly among gay and bisexual men (Emlet, 2006a). Adopting a strengths-based perspective, this feature of the social networks of PLWH is an important adaptation as the shared experience of HIV can be an invaluable source of support and the basis for community-building within these alternate families (Warren-Jeanpiere et al., 2017).Older women living with HIV.Research on the support networks of PLWH and on aging with HIV more generally has focused on men, especially gay and bisexual men, as they have historically made up the majority of those affected by the HIV epidemic. Older women make up 12.5% of all PLWH in the United States. Out of all women living with HIV (WLWH), more than half (54%) are older than age 50 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022).HIV, like many chronic diseases, is not randomly distributed but disproportionately impacts certain groups. Black and Latina women, for instance, make up 77% of all WLWH in the United States. Thus, the majority of older WLWH live at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities, navigating sexism, racism, ableism, and ageism in systems and social structures such as healthcare and social services, which are designed without their needs in mind.Convoys, or social/personal networks, are the constellation of social ties surrounding people as they move through life.Aging among older WLWH is a unique experience that results from cumulative negative effects of oppressive systems that encompass sexism, ableism, ageism, racism, and poverty (Rubtsova et al., 2017). These intersections manifest in a range of stigma experiences (e.g., fear of HIV disclosure, social rejection, social isolation, inadequate social support) that ultimately affect the health and well-being of older WLWH. This makes older WLWH an especially invisible and vulnerable population. Here, we examine the unique and interactive roles of HIV stigma, age, gender identity, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic position (SEP) in shaping older WLWHs informal support resources.We begin by introducing a theoretical framework to guide this review, the intersectional convoy model. Focusing on older PLWH, we highlight the influences of HIV-related stigma and ageism before considering gender, race/ethnicity, and SEP, first individually and then in combination through a discussion of the social networks of older WLWH. We aim to address both strengths and vulnerabilities of these social networks, including the amount, source, and types of support available to older WLWH as well as how HIV stigma is a barrier to support and high-quality social ties.Intersectional Convoy ModelThe convoy model of social relations provides a flexible and adaptive framework for conceptualizing social networks and social support (Fuller et al., 2020). Convoys, or social/personal networks, can be thought of as the constellation of social ties surrounding an individual as they move through the life course. When functioning optimally, convoys are meant to protect against stress and provide individuals with the resources needed to adapt to lifes challenges. The convoy model describes social relations as multidimensional, encompassing structure, function, and quality. Convoy structure refers to objective characteristics, like size (i.e., number of close and important others) and composition (e.g., based on kinship, gender, race, etc.). Convoy function encompasses various types of social support (i.e., instrumental/tangible, emotional, feelings of belonging and affirmation). Quality, or support adequacy, describes the gap between desired and perceived levels of support. Social networks might be considered inadequate when there is a mismatch between ones desired level, type, or source of support and ones perception of these dimensions.Although there are widely used metrics for each of these dimensions (e.g., family vs. friend network composition), we broaden our perspective to also consider HIV-related characteristics that might be related to stigma. For example, in the context of HIV, measures of network composition may include HIV seroconcordance, or the proportion of other PLWH in ones network. Similarly, HIV disclosure among network members can be considered an indicator of emotional closeness or support (Messer et al., 2020).Each of these dimensions has an influence on health and well-being across the lifespan and is shaped by personal and situational factors (Fuller et al., 2020). There are well-documented differences in the structure and function of personal networks by age, gender, race, and SEP. Most discussions of the factors shaping social relations consider them independently. However, it is difficult to parse their independent effects and important to acknowledge the intersectionality of identities in shaping convoy structure and function. The five corners intersectionality model captures how the convergence of race, SEP, gender identity, age, and HIV stigma shape the experiences of people living with HIV (Porter & Brennan-Ing, 2019). This model can be applied to relationship experiences and social ties, too.We draw from both theoretical frameworks to propose an intersectional convoy model that considers how different personal and situational factors, including HIV-stigma, age, gender identity, race/ethnicity, and SEP interact to shape the social networks of PLWH (see Figure 1, below). We review variations in network structure, composition, social support, and relationship quality. After establishing the independent effects of these factors on older PLWHs social convoys, we apply the intersectional convoy model to demonstrate how these characteristics intersect to shape older WLWHs social relations.Figure 1.Intersectional Convoy ModelHIV Stigma and AgeIn general, older adults report smaller, less conflictual, and more emotionally close and satisfying social networks compared to younger adults. They are less likely to maintain peripheral, role-based social ties, opting instead for emotionally close and stable ones (Carstensen, 2021). Depending upon other factors, namely health and physical functioning, some older adults may withdraw from social engagement. One major distinction between aging with and without HIV is that PLWH are more likely to have multiple age-related chronic conditions, like cardiovascular disease, as well as conditions related to HIV and its treatments.Older PLWH have been found to be more socially isolated than their younger peers, highlighting the intersecting effects of age-related and HIV-related stigmas (Emlet, 2006a, 2006b). Older PLWH tend to have smaller support networks dominated by friends, rather than spouses or children as is often expected of older people (Cantor et al., 2009). Compared to those without HIV, older PLWH reported less availability of support from network members. Shippy and Karpiak (2005) found that most older PLWH report inadequate emotional and instrumental support and have fragile networks; further, 79% of the sample reported living alone.Similarly, Brennan-Ing and colleagues (2016) used network composition and contact with network members to identify network typologies of older PLWH, including isolated, friend-centered, and integrated, finding that the isolated group had inadequate social care resources and poorer psychosocial functioning. Importantly, these findings mirror the network typologies that have been identified in older adult samples without HIV (e.g., Ali et al., 2022), suggesting that HIV serostatus is only one of multiple characteristics that shape social networks and other social identities may in fact be more prominent. In the following sections, we describe how gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status factor into the social convoys of older PLWH.Gender. The social networks of men and women have been found to differ across many dimensions. Generally, women tend to have larger, more diverse, and more emotionally close networks than men (Ajrouch et al., 2005). These differences are primarily driven by societal norms and cultural expectations, rather than innate sex/gender differences. In one study, although there were no differences in network size, older WLWH were more likely to have a spouse they could rely upon for support than men and report greater functional support sources compared to men (Cantor et al., 2009). Some studies show the positive effect of HIV-positive peers on the mental health of WLWH (Cederbaum et al., 2017). In terms of convoy function, WLWH often report more adequate emotional support than men (Shippy & Karpiak, 2005). Still, the stigma that stems from older WLWHs seropositivity represents a major challenge they must contend with in meeting their support needs (Durvasula, 2014).Older adults are less likely to maintain peripheral, role-based social ties, opting instead for emotionally close and stable ones.Reluctance to disclose HIV status, which is perceived as particularly shameful among older women, is a fundamental barrier to seeking support (Grodensky et al., 2015). Depending upon the timing of seroconversion in their life course, older WLWH may be dealing with HIV stigma and implications for social relations for the first time. Few studies exclusively focus on the social networks of older WLWH, which may be larger and more burdensome or demanding than networks of other PLWH.Older WLWH frequently are caregivers for spouses/partners, adult children, older parents, and grandchildren, and have other significant social responsibilities (Lee et al., 2021). Women make up the vast majority of informal caregivers worldwide. These responsibilities put additional strains on older women who are already managing their own chronic conditions and concomitant psychosocial sequelae. At the same time, older WLWH may not have access to traditional caregiving resources for themselves, such as spouses or children, despite significant care needs. Like many PLWH, some older WLWH consider family to be unreliable sources of support and often prefer support from friends, particularly HIV-positive peers (Warren-Jeanpiere et al., 2017). Still for others, close family, namely daughters and grandchildren, have been recognized as key support sources (Grodensky et al., 2015).Race and ethnicity.There are well-documented differences in social convoys across race and ethnicity, particularly with regard to family composition (Ajrouch et al., 2001; Fuller et al., 2020). Older Black and Latinx individuals, for example, have smaller, more family-centric, and emotionally close networks than do their White peers (Ajrouch et al., 2001; Feng, 2023). Among older PLWH, one study found no differences in network size across racial/ethnic groups, though older Black and Latinx individuals reported more functional support sources than did White (Cantor et al., 2009). The significance of kinship ties, including fictive kin, is evident in the social convoys of older Black and Latinx individuals as a strategy against social isolation.Older Black and Latinx PLWH may be at an advantage with social convoys composed of family of choice given that this aligns with cultural norms of including extended or more distantly related relatives in convoys. On the other hand, cultural attitudes rooted in religion, respect, and simpatico (i.e., keeping the peace) may exacerbate HIV-related stigma for older PLWH (Beaulaurier et al., 2009; Grodensky et al., 2015). Thus, the cultural aspects for older Black and Latinx adults living with HIV can serve as both protective and risk factors in their access to social support resources.Socioeconomic position.SEP primarily influences convoy structure and composition, often through homophilythe tendency to form social ties with those who share similar characteristics. SEP can be captured through a variety of metrics, including educational attainment, income, wealth, occupational prestige, and social class. SEP is often linked to social capitalthe resources, information, and other benefits that can be derived from personal networks. For example, those with greater educational attainment and occupational prestige tend to have larger and more diverse convoys, representing increased access to social resources (Ajrouch et al., 2005; Feng, 2023).To some extent, high SEP can offset the disadvantages brought on by structural ableism, ageism, sexism, and racism for older PLWH by increasing access to resources, including informal support sources. The HIV epidemic, embedded in inequities, has always disproportionately affected lower SEP individuals and those in poverty, showing up in increased rates of infection and mortality and reduced access to treatment (Pellowski et al., 2013). Consequently, low SEP often amplifies the negative effects of other stigmas and inequities, which reduces access to informal supports.Application of the Intersectional Convoy ModelIntersectionality, or multiple identities, as well as the stereotypes and biases against them, are experienced simultaneously, which is one reason it is difficult to isolate the independent effects of personal and situational characteristics on convoy structure and function. This is especially true for older WLWH, the majority of whom are Black and Latina (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022).In a recent study of HIV-positive women of color, Messer and colleagues (2020) examined structural (e.g., size, composition) and functional (e.g., different types of support) network characteristics and found that different dimensions are uniquely associated with one another, as well as with health outcomes. For example, although the majority of these womens networks were composed of family, family ties were only associated with treatment-specific support. Further, network composition factors that were associated with lower depression included enumerating network members who were family and those who were HIV-positive. Findings from a qualitative study of older Black WLWH emphasize the role that these women often play as the family matriarch (Warren-Jeanpiere et al., 2017), who often sacrifices their own support and care needs for the well-being of their loved ones. The experience of providing informal care for others while managing their own chronic conditions may be especially evident among older Black WLWH, highlighting another prime example whereby intersecting identities impact the experience of aging with HIV.Cultural aspects for older Black and Latinx adults living with HIV can serve as protective and risk factors in their access to social support resources.For older Latina women, cultural attitudes like simpatico, preservation of traditional gender roles, and strong religious beliefs can amplify the negative effects of sexism, making them similarly vulnerable to HIV-related stigma and social isolation (Beaulaurier et al., 2009). Religion and spirituality, however, are also sources of resilience for older Black and Latina WLWH (Grodensky et al., 2015; Warren-Jeanpiere et al., 2017). Religious groups can function as supportive communities or barriers to support, as when HIV-related stigma that is rampant in these communities discourages HIV disclosure. Such cultural attitudes can make it especially difficult for older women to disclose HIV status and hinder support seeking.The intersection of race/ethnicity and SEP is also evident for older WLWH, who are more socially disadvantaged than other groups (e.g., due to lifetime effects of low wages, occupational prestige, etc.). Low SEP can be a barrier to well-connected and well-structured social convoys with negative reciprocal effects on health and well-being. The stressors stemming from low SEP (e.g., low income, unemployment, unstable housing) contribute to chronic burden, which is further amplified by HIV serostatus for low-income, ethnic minority WLWH and associated with low levels of social support (Gurung et al., 2004). While some informal support resources may be more readily available for older ethnic minority WLWH (e.g., based on community and family structures), their support needs are also more pronounced for coping with structural inequities. Researchers, policy makers, and program planners must intentionally apply these intersectional frameworks to assess the strengths and vulnerabilities conferred by these multiple identities when considering older WLWH.Implications and ConclusionsAlthough existing research on older WLWHs support networks provides some information about their support needs and resources, it is unclear how their convoys are structured, what functions they fulfill, and antecedent factors. It is important to understand what social resources older WLWH have available to meet their support needs and know where to intervene. Personal characteristics play a role in facilitating or hindering older WLWH from constructing personal convoys that are maximally beneficial for their specific life circumstances and support needs. Implications for research are clearincreased attention to the experiences of older WLWH, including experiences with social relations, is warranted.The intersectional convoy model we present provides a framework from which to systematically investigate the role of intersectional identities in shaping close social ties and their consequences. By systematically measuring different dimensions of social relations, researchers can gain a more comprehensive view of what aspects of social relations are universal versus those that differ within and across populations. Understanding these similarities and differences can shed light on when, where, and with whom to intervene.Further, the intersectional convoy model provides an excellent framework for developing interventions because of its attention to personal and situational circumstances that are experienced simultaneously. Considering intersectionality as it relates to personal convoys allows us to identify potential cumulative vulnerabilities and strengths in social networks. Leveraging the strengths and adaptations that have manifested in social ties among older WLWH is a promising way to ensure healthy aging with HIV.Jasmine Manalel, PhD, is a senior research associate at the Brookdale Center for Healthy Aging at Hunter College, City University of New York.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpecial Edition 2023On Disability, Race, and SexualityBy Rani KronickDecember 06, 2023TagsJustice & EquityHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureThis past fall, Rani Kronick, a scholar and disability rights activist, interviewed Patricia Fraser-Morales, a social services professional, about living with ableism and ageism. Morales was born with spina bifida, identifies as a lesbian and as a woman of color. She lives her life with no excuses, advocating for herself and others like her to do the same.Rani Kronick:Patricia, were very pleased that you agreed to share your experiences [of] actually living with ageism and ableism. This is a critical part of the story.Could you start by introducing yourself and telling us a bit about your background?Patricia Fraser-Morales:From the very beginning, my disability has been my primary identity because it has impacted me the most. I was born with spina bifida in a Caribbean country, so disability was always part of my life. I wasnt treated very differently a lot of the timeI rode a bike with training wheels, I had friends, I went to school. There were elements of trying to hide my disability at times. If I sat down at a family event, my crutches were taken away from me. There were elements of shaming or covering up.We came to the United States primarily because I needed medical attention that was not available in my home country; I was almost 9. Everything changed when I got here. I came from a family where they fought for me to go to regular school [in the Caribbean] and I climbed 3 flights of stairs a day to go to class. I came to a country where they said, Oh, she's disabled, she's going to be in special education. Starting my freshman year of high school, I was fully mainstreamed.I first became aware at about 7 or 8, that there were no adults around me with my disability and I thought that when I grew up, it would disappear. I asked my mom and she said, No, it's permanent. And that's when I knew.Rani:For disabled people who dont grow up in families with disabilities, connections with other disabled people dont happen naturally. Can you talk about how you got involved in a disability community?Patricia:It happened from the moment I stepped into that [special-education] classroom, because it has given me insight into the community and how it has and hasnt changed. I was around other children with disabilities, but I didnt meet any adults. When I was 10, I attended a sleepaway camp for disabled kids. It was there that I met a woman with spina bifida, who was educated, married, and had children. For a long time afterwards, I aspired to be a physical therapist just like her.I joined a program when I was 17 for young women with disabilities and we were paired up with mentors who were women with disabilities. That was my first experience dealing with strong, independent advocates, doing the normal things that other non-disabled women were doing and fighting for their right to do so. It made a huge impact on me. I have also turned the tables and done that for women younger than myself.Rani:How do you think some of those experiences translate for older people who are experiencing disability for the first time as they age?Patricia:I think it depends on personality. Sometimes it is easy for them to acclimate, Oh, its going to happen, Im getting older. And then therere people who walk around for years leaning on someone instead of using a cane. It runs the spectrum.Being the age I am now I need to start doing certain things differently and embrace this, now that Im getting older and slower. You know what, this is the reality. I was fine before, and Ill be fine again.Rani:As you know, experiencing and expressing sexuality can be difficult for girls with mobility disabilities. Do you think your experience maturing was different because you have a disability?Patricia:It goes back to being in a Caribbean family. Being gay is not acceptable. In hindsight I remember having an attraction to girls. But I wasnt supposed to talk about it.That changed in college. In my second-year English class, we read Audre Lordes autobiographyZami: A New Spelling of My Name[Crossing Press, 1982]. I was supposed to read 34 chapters over the weekend. I read the whole thing. From beginning to end, I identified with her: Caribbean, the oldest of three girls, had a disability, knew she was gay when she was little, had certain friendships in high school.I need to start doing certain things differently and embrace this, now that Im getting older and slower.I read that book dozens of times because I identified with it so much, and that's when I acknowledged the fact that I liked women. I am fortunate that when I finally came out to my family, it wasnt a big deal.My identity as a lesbian is kind of the same as my identity as a person with a disability. I dont do the same things everybody else does, Ive adapted it to how I see myself in the world.One of the ways women met back in the day was through personal ads. If I put in that I had a disability, I wouldnt get a single call. I didnt do bars or clubs. Many of them are not accessible. I did the Lesbian and Gay center a lot, attending their parties. Thats how I met other women. I went to dances and parades outside of functions, outside of bars . In those environments, the disability is always seen first.Ive been thinking about intersectionality and how I go about the world, how my gender, race, [and] disability blend. Its very compartmentalized, and not in a negative way. It depends on where I am. If I am in a gay and lesbian space, I am seen as a woman who loves women. My disability is not that big a deal because a lot of lesbians have dealt with their own issues with their bodies, like cancer and addiction . Theyre open to conversations and difference.If Im in an all-Black space, it depends on whether Im in a gay Black space or a straight Black space. If Im in a gay Black space, I can say or do whatever. If Im in a straight space where Im the only out gay one, they address me as a person with a disability or as a Black woman first.Rani:How do you think your experience as someone with a disability is changing as you get older, and have you experienced new structural challenges?Patricia:There was a long time before I turned 50 ... when I felt like my disability was the only disability I will have. Getting older has made me realize that this is not the case. I can still get cancer, I can have things come up for me medically ... I feel like some things have changed for the better in terms of the recognition that people with disabilities can have other health issues.The priority should be helping people age in places where theyre comfortable.Ive been lucky to always have had health insurance, but until they changed the preexisting-conditions [exclusions], I was limited in what I could access. Having that removed has helped me.I worry about losing my physical ability to do what I do now . There may come a time when, because of age, I wont be able to dress myself or use the bathroom on my own. I have devices now that help me pick things up from the floor.It helps a lot that the 60+ population is growing. They want to stay home to age, they want services in their community that will enable them to age in place. That all [helps] people with disabilities.Rani:What would you like organizations like SAGE to focus on for elders with disabilities?Patricia:The priority should be helping people age in places where theyre comfortable. Acknowledging that people should have the right to access spaces with dignity. Doing a fundraiser on Fire Island, for example, is fine, but the house you choose, and the route to the house, should be accessible to people with disabilities. Ask people with disabilities for their input. How can we make this event more inclusive for the people were trying to raise money for?Rani:Are there services or programs that are missing for elders with disabilities?Patricia:I would like to see more involvement of people with disabilities locally, contributing to conversations about how to improve circumstances for everyone. Write more pieces that include the people who are being impacted. Elders organizations and disability groups could work together. Theres also universal design. And SSI benefits for people with disabilities who have never worked have remained the same for decades, while Social Security and SSDI payments have increased. If all the people that this affected got together to say, living wage! that would be great.Rani:What do you want to share that you know now that you wish you knew when you were younger?Patricia:Representation matters. Exposure matters. Mentoring someone will change your life and it will change the person you mentors life. We cant change things tomorrow, but if you are a woman, a lesbian, a Black woman, etc., find ways to connect with people who are younger than you so you can start planting the seed of things changing, one person at a time. Thinking about it as a global thing is stressful, but if you think about it as one person at a time, you can connect with people you can learn from, and people who can learn from you.It makes me emotional, but it's been a huge deal for me to have met and been around people who look like me or who experience the world the way I do. One of the most impactful experiences I ever had was introducing a young woman with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) to a mother of a 5-year-old with OI. They were in each others lives for years. The little girl is now a teenager herself. I remember the mom saying how much this meant to her. It made a difference in how she raised her child and the expectations she had for her future.Rani:Patricia, thank you so much for this time. Ive learned a lot and youve given me a lot to think about.Photo credit: Shutterstock/LightspringYou may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpecial Edition 2023SAGE Uses an Advocacy Agenda to Confront Structural Ageism and Ableism for LGBTQ+ EldersBy Josh DubenskyDecember 06, 2023TagsJustice & EquityAgeism & CultureAbstract:SAGE, the countrys largest and oldest organization dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTQ+ elders, offers a range of supportive services that play a key role in informing and supporting SAGEs growing policy advocacy strategy. Formed with a focus on LGBTQ+ elders, SAGEs policy advocacy focuses on addressing the structural challenges to dignified aging engendered by ableism and ageism. The article includes examples of how to form coalitions with grassroots organizers in the service of advocating for elders from marginalized groups, especially the LGBTQ+ community and people with disabilities.KeyWords:ableism, advocacy, ageism, disability, grassroots, LGBTQ+SAGE is the countrys largest and oldest organization dedicated to improving the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) elders. SAGE offers supportive services and consumer resources to LGBTQ+ elders and their caregivers, LGBTQ+-competent services through New York Citys first LGBTQ+-affirming elder housing developments, education and technical assistance for aging service providers and LGBTQ+ organizations through its National Resource Center on LGBT Aging, and cultural competency training through SAGECare. These programs allow SAGE to provide a range of services for LGBTQ+ elders across the country, and they play a key role in informing and supporting our growing policy advocacy strategy.Before joining SAGE, I worked as a policy aide for the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, where I collaborated with countless nonprofits and advocacy groups fighting to create change for their constituencies. Now, working for SAGE, I find myself on the other side of the table, helping to expand and formulate an advocacy strategy that will create long-term policy results. My time in the U.S. Senate, and with SAGE, helped expose me to a range of advocacy agendas and strategies. While there may not be one clear approach that works for every group or community, there are fundamental challenges of structural discrimination that almost every marginalized community must confront. The long and complex history of discrimination in this country can make it difficult to fully comprehend the intersecting biases facing a community. However, finding strength in diversity, and discovering the communitys external and internal intersecting interests, can form a strong base from which to build a powerful policy-advocacy agenda.Structural Ageism and Ableism in the LGBTQ+ CommunityTheres a long history behind the structural barriers in our society that continue to create challenges for older people and people with disabilities. These range from failing to provide reasonable accommodations so an individual can work, or failing to provide access to long-term services and supports that allow an individual to live independently in the community of their choice. When older LGBTQ+ people or people with a disability require specialized support services, complex medical treatment, or reasonable accommodations, failure to make those as accessible as possible can create a seemingly insurmountable barrier to health and independence.At SAGE, one of the ways we work to embrace diversity and intersectionality is by finding ways to combat how ageism and ableism impact our community. LGBTQ+ older people and LGBTQ+ people with disabilities must navigate the same ageist and ableist structures as their non-LGBTQ+ peers, but they must do so while also navigating the rising tide of anti-LGBTQ+ violence and discrimination.Understanding what exactly is meant when people discuss the challenges of structural ageism or ableism may seem confusing, but this is nothing compared to the real-life consequences that are inflicted upon older people and those in the disability community due to the complex way these institutional forms of discrimination are rooted in our society.SAGE begins its fight with the powerful understanding that LGBTQ+ older people must secure a seat at the table.A report from the World Health Organization (2021) found that often people fail to recognize the existence of such institutional ageism because the rules, norms and practices of the institution are long-standing, have become ritualized and are seen as normal.Similarly, a report fromThe New England Journal of Medicinefound that people with disabilities face substantial inequities ranging from education and employment, to housing and transportation, to access to broadband and other technologies. They also experience inequities in health care quality and access stemming from physical, attitudinal, and communication barriers; inadequate professional training in legal obligations and the needs of people with disabilities; and inadequate knowledge regarding, and reimbursement for, accommodations (Valdez & Swenor, 2023).SAGEs goal is not only to confront these complex discriminatory structures, but to do so via an intersectional lens through which we understand and value the experiences and needs of LGBTQ+ elders. This has become even more difficult now with the alarming rise of anti-LGBTQ+ laws across the country, a rise that requires SAGE not only to continue providing culturally competent services, but also to find ways to strengthen its fight against multiple forms of discrimination through a robust state and national advocacy strategy.Nothing About Us, Without UsSAGE begins its fight with the powerful understanding that LGBTQ+ older people must secure a seat at the table. This literal seat at the table is grounded in the spirit of nothing about us without us, and is part of SAGEs core values. SAGE is working to confront the barriers of ageism and ableism but doing so from the older LGBTQ+ perspective. There are no shortage of organizations and advocates fighting for the rights of older people and those in the disability community. However, for years both aging and disability policy routinely failed to consider the needs of LGBTQ+ people. When planning to address housing instability, food insecurity, or access to healthcare, there was no thought given to how to ensure the needs of LGBTQ+ older people were met.When embraced as partners and supported in the frontline advocacy work they do every day, grassroots groups are indispensable.The tragic consequences of LGBTQ+ discrimination have forced some older adults to hide their identity in order to access services, which has rarely been addressed. The barriers our nation has put in place to access necessary and lifesaving medical care and services often mean that older people and people with disabilities do not have the luxury of simply finding another medical provider. Structural barriers, such as cost or lack of affordable transportation, can mean that if the medical provider in their area is not accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, LGBTQ+ elders and people with disabilities have little choice but to go back in the closet to access the services they need.Only relatively recently, thanks to decades of activism, has public policy started to incorporate and respond to the needs of the older LGBTQ+ community. This is possible because members of the community ensured their voices were heard when and where policy was being formed that would impact them. There are many issues and challenges SAGE works to address through its policy advocacy, but our overarching goal focuses on amplifying the voices of LGBTQ+ elders and ensuring the seat at the table they fought so hard to achieve cannot be taken away.Putting Words to ActionA seat at the policy table is key but overcoming the barriers of structural ageism and ableism faced by the LGBTQ+ community requires far more action. Its important to make sure that the seat is a permanent position of influence and garners the respect that will help to shape and inform policy for years to come, not a token nod to the community. As such, a concrete strategy and clear goals are needed to ensure that the seat at the table is not wasted, and is genuinely nothing about us without us.Start with Your StrengthsFor SAGE, we begin with our strength as a service provider and an advocacy organization. SAGE arose from a need for LGBTQ+ elders in New York City to have access to safe and culturally competent services and has since grown into a nationwide leader on LGBTQ+ aging with growing international ties. Discrimination and fear barred many LGBTQ+ elders from accessing care from traditional providers, so SAGE found a way to help provide that care or educate providers to do it themselves.SAGEs strength lies in the fact that as a national organization, working with a nationwide network of state and local partners, it can provide or connect individuals to services in the community. These direct links to the individuals being served and local advocates working on their behalf allows SAGE to work with LGBTQ+ elders to uplift their voices and concerns all the way to policymakers in Washington, DC.Embrace Diversity and Build PartnershipsThe individuals SAGE serves, like many throughout the nation, are not defined by a single identity or community. SAGE began with a focus on LGBTQ+ elders, but within that community individuals have countless experiences and life stories that help to shape how they will age. Just as there are multiple ways to understand an individual and community, there are often multiple ways to approach policy and advocacy that can help broaden support. Policy important to one community will likely impact other groups and organizations not directly tied to a mission.We have seen this in SAGEs work with aging, housing, and HIV groups. These relationships can provide an opportunity to expand partnerships into new areas, allowing community and organizations to work together, learn from one another, and address limits and blind spots. SAGE is strongest when it is partnering with, supporting, and learning from organizations that are serving and led by diverse communities. A broader coalition also will help strengthen the importance of the issues SAGE advocates for to policymakers, proving these are not isolated issues facing just one community. The more voices calling for change, the harder they are to ignore.Strengthen GrassrootsStrong relationships between policymakers and advocacy organizations are important, but there is nothing like being able to bring a groundswell of grassroots support to advocate for one issue. Through a network of state partners SAGE strives to support local groups across the country, and in turn build a strong coalition to advocate for change on the national level. This network not only helps inform SAGEs national strategy, but also provides a powerful tool to influence elected leaders. SAGE has experience advocating for change on both the national level and the state level in New York, and in both areas the importance of supporting and listening to our LGBTQ+ elders and grassroots advocates is clear. The work of full-time paid advocates is an important tool, but one that should support and compliment the work of grassroots activists and lived experience of our elders. Grassroots groups are often the organizations most closely connected to and representative of the communities being impacted. They understand firsthand how the debates in Washington will impact the lives of people on the ground. When embraced as partners and supported in the frontline advocacy work they do every day, grassroots groups are indispensable.ConclusionUnfortunately, there are few easy fixes to taking down the challenges and barriers facing LGBTQ+ elders in the United States. Members of the community will face a lifetime of homophobia and transphobia, and then learn to confront the problems of structural ageism and ableism that continue to challenge millions of people every year. Of course, this is only made worse for LGBTQ+ elders of color and trans elders, who now find themselves facing increasing hostility. But, by recognizing that we live in interconnected communities, where needs and interests often overlap, we can ensure our advocacy strategy is similarly interconnected. The barriers of discrimination are not isolated, they easily work across whatever communities they need to succeed, and neither should our policy strategy isolate itself.SAGE could not succeed in its mission by solely working to end LGBTQ+ discrimination and leaving in place the barriers faced by the larger aging and disability community. As daunting and complex as the challenges seem, they provide the basis for uniting around policy goals and achieving success. The barriers are too large for any one community to tackle on its own. But together we can create a blueprint for bringing them down.Josh Dubensky is the Housing Policy Advocate Associate at SAGE.

There are countless examples of the law serving as a tool to combat discrimination, from legal challenges to segregation by the civil rights movement, to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). But racism, ableism, and ageism limit the legal rights for marginalized communities. This article will identify the laws limitations and its impact on older adults, people with disabilities, and communities of color, and will identify the ways it can be utilized to combat those inequities.Key Words:advocacy, ageism, ableism, discrimination, legal, racismHistorically marginalized communities often rely upon the law to protect their civil rights. While there are many examples of the law expanding rights for various communities, several problems and inequities remain embedded in our legal system. Statutory policies like Medicaids institutional bias limit autonomy by essentially forcing older adults and people with disabilities into institutional long-term care. Meanwhile, Medicaid estate recovery perpetuates intergenerational poverty for communities of color that relied upon Medicaid to provide essential care. Finally, the courts play a significant role in protecting individual rights, although some of those protections may be at risk as the judiciary changes. Nonetheless, the law can still be leveraged to ensure equitable access to crucial care.Limitations of the LawHistorical Inequities Around Age, Race, and Disability Are Baked Into the LawMedicaid and Medicare were enacted in 1965 as part of the Social Security Act. Both programs cover older adults and people with disabilities, but the services offered are inherently institutional and offer limited options for people to receive long-term care outside of facilities. The only guaranteed long-term care coverage for most individuals is institutional Medicaid, because Medicare only provides 100 days of nursing home coverage following a three-day inpatient hospitalization. While every state offers Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS), it is an optional benefit, resulting in great variability in how people can access these services. States use a maze of waivers that vary drastically in the type of services covered, the number of people covered, and potentially the quality of services. These variations occur between states and even within the same state, as Medicaid waivers can, and often do, differ across Medicaid populations.There also are delays in receiving services for optional benefits like HCBS. For example, older adults and people with disabilities often remain on waiting lists for HCBS coverage to begin because insufficient funding leads to a reduced number of slots. The limited data we have on HCBS shows tens of thousands of people across dozens of states are on these waiting lists (Burns et al., 2022). Further, this data does not capture individuals who have not applied for HCBS because of the many obstacles and wait times, making the number of individuals eligible for services likely even higher.Meanwhile, coverage for institutions such as nursing homes is required under Medicaid, which means they avoid the complexities of waivers and waiting lists. This disparity creates an institutional bias whereby the law, specifically the Medicaid statute, effectively pushes older adults and people with disabilities into nursing homes as their only guaranteed option for long-term care services. The institutional bias contradicts most peoples wishes to receive services in their homes and adds fuel to the fears of many in the disability and aging communities of ending up in a facility.The institutional bias in the Medicaid statute makes institutionalization the standard for long-term care, despite being the least popular option, effectively codifying existing ableist and ageist views that older adults and people with disabilities are not capable of and do not deserve autonomy or community integration (Kilaru & Gee, 2020).Institutional bias contradicts most peoples wishes to receive services at home and fuels the fears of many in the disability and aging communities of ending up in a facility.Further, racial disparities occur even among institutionalized nursing home residents. Residents of color are more likely to be placed in lower quality nursing facilities with higher rates of infections, hospitalizations, and pressure sores (Carlson & Selassie, 2022). These disparities occur even after accounting for socioeconomic status, geography, and payment source. One study found facilities with predominantly Black and Hispanic residents had 34% and 60% fewer registered nurses, respectively, than facilities that were majority White, even after factoring in insurance, geography, and underlying medical conditions (Lowenstein, 2014). Residents of color in low-quality nursing facilities could receive higher quality care in the community if the institutional bias were eliminated and HCBS became more available.Another major inequity occurs in Medicaid via estate recovery, under which states are required to recover the costs associated with a deceased individuals Medicaid long termcare expenses. While there are some limited exemptions, for most beneficiaries, estate recovery perpetuates poverty for future generations by eliminating modest assets, like a family home, from their inheritance. Communities of color in particular are greatly harmed by estate recovery in part because avoiding it requires complicated and costly Medicaid estate planning (Medicaid and CHIP Payment Access Commission [MACPAC], 2021).Further, states are required to undergo estate recovery even if the procedural costs are greater than the value of the estate. In practice, estate recovery can serve as a punitive system, punishing families for needing Medicaid for long-term care. Therefore, while Medicaid is a crucial program for older adults and people with disabilities, the institutional bias and estate recovery mandate worsen inequities, particularly for those living at the intersection or race, advanced age, and disability.The Power of LawNursing Home Reform LawIn 1987 Congress passed the Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA, 1987) following reports that people with disabilities and older adults were receiving inadequate care in facilities, in addition to suffering widespread neglect and abuse.The NHRA was significant in expanding rights and protections for residents, including the creation of the Residents Bill of Rights. The Residents Bill of Rights lists various protections to which residents are entitled, including freedom from abuse or restraints, the right to exercise self-determination and participate in their own care plan, and the right to voice grievances without retribution (Resident Rights, 2022). These protections refute ageist and ableist notions of long-term care users by guaranteeing nursing home residents the rights they would be entitled to outside the facility.There are also racial equity considerations because people of color have increasingly entered nursing homes since the NHRA was passed (Feng et al., 2011). Protecting and strengthening the protections under the NHRA is especially crucial to ensure residents of color are not further discriminated against after a lifetime of systemic discrimination, which often can result in poorer health outcomes and more limited access to quality long-term care (Doty et al., 2022). Although disparities remain prevalent, the NHRA provides federal agencies the authority to enact regulations to remove these disparities and create a more equitable long termcare system.The Role of the CourtsPublic benefits programs upon which older adults rely, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are subject to constitutional due process requirements. In 1970, the Supreme Court inGoldberg v. Kellyestablished that the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause requires advance notice and the opportunity for a hearing, before the termination of benefits. The Court found that government benefits, like nutritional services, financial assistance, and government healthcare programs were statutory entitlements, not mere privileges, and the loss of these crucial services would result in significant harm and deprivation of beneficiaries property interests (Goldberg v. Kelly, 1970). Goldberg played a monumental role in protecting benefits that older adults and people with disabilities particularly rely upon and greatly advanced civil legal advocacy for indigent populations.WhileGoldbergoutlined clear due process requirements with respect to government benefits, another more recent U.S. Supreme Court case could have significantly limited the rights of enrollees. The issue inHealth & Hospital Corporation of Marion County (HHC) v. Talevski(2023) centered on whether the plaintiff could sue under a civil rights statute (Civil Action for Deprivation of Rights, 2015; also known as Section 1983) for violations of the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act (FNHRA).Section 1983 allows individuals to bring a civil action when their civil or constitutional rights have been violated. Section 1983 is significant because most statutes, including the FNHRA and Medicaid statute, do not explicitly confer a private right of action, leaving individuals limited to either the administrative appeals process or recourse under Section 1983. Advocates were concerned that the Court would not only find that Section 1983 does not apply to the FNHRA, but also that Section 1983 may not be used for many statutes passed by Congress using their authority under the Spending Clause of the Constitution (Rudowitz & Sobel, 2022).Most older adults and people with disabilities are institutionalized at higher rates than other Medicaid populations.Congress passes many laws under its Spending Clause authority, like Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Such a decision would mean individuals could only use an administrative process to address a civil or constitutional violation, significantly limiting their avenues for recourse. Fortunately, the Court upheld decades of precedent and recognized that the FNHRA unambiguously confers rights enforceable under Section 1983. While this decision was favorable for older adults, people with disabilities, and other individuals who rely upon the courts to protect their rights, there is still a risk that future cases may weaken Section 1983 for other federal statutes.Justice Barrett in her concurring opinion stated that Section 1983 enforcement sets a high bar in which the statute must confer explicit rights-creating terms for an individual [and] although the FNHRA clears [the high bar], many federal statutes will not (Health and Hospital Corp. of Marion County v. Talevski, 2023). Justice Barretts hint potentially sets up future battles over the applicability of Section 1983 to other statutes.Olmstead v. L.C.and Rebalancing InitiativesAs stated above, Medicaid only requires coverage for institutional Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS). In the decades since Medicaid was passed, states increasingly began using their waiver authority to cover HCBS for specific populations. These HCBS waivers provide an alternative to institutionalization and rebalanced Medicaid dollars away from institutions into more integrated community settings. Rebalancing ramped up significantly following the 1999 case,Olmstead v. L.C.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that unjustified isolation due to institutional placement violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and that people with disabilities have the right to live and receive services in the setting that is least restrictive (Olmstead v. L.C., 1999).FollowingOlmstead, the use of HCBS expanded drastically to cover more populations. In 1988 only 10% of LTSS spending went to HCBS, compared to 56% in 2018 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2021). While this is a positive move, there are still limitations. For example, some waiver populations, like older adults and people with physical disabilities, receive less than 50% LTSS spending on HCBS (MACPAC, 2019). This strongly suggests that most older adults and people with disabilities are institutionalized at higher rates than other Medicaid populations. Nonetheless, the Olmstead decision and subsequent rebalancing initiatives significantly expanded the rights of Medicaid LTSS beneficiaries to receive care in the community and can be leveraged to advance efforts to eliminate the institutional bias.How the Law Can Fight Structural DiscriminationEquitable Reforms to LTSSWhile the NHRA has gone a long way to protect residents, more efforts are needed to improve the quality of nursing facilities, with a focus on implementing equitable policies to alleviate racial disparities in nursing facility care. Compared to facilities with majority White residents, facilities with majority Black or Hispanic residents face lower staffing levels resulting in significantly worse health outcomes, and increased mortality rates (Harrington et al., 2020).Improving staffing levels would improve health outcomes for all residents but will have a greater impact on residents of color as they are more likely to reside in facilities that are grossly understaffed. Fortunately, some efforts are underway to improve nursing home staffing, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on minimum staffing levels this year.Additionally, making HCBS a mandatory benefit would eliminate the institutional bias and the confusing patchwork of HCBS waivers, allowing older adults and people with disabilities to have a meaningful choice on how they receive long-term care. Developing an equitable HCBS system also means addressing issues that prevent access to HCBS, including the lack of accessible and affordable housing, reliable transportation, and a high-quality direct care workforce. Improving coordination across service providers, investing in the direct care workforce, and greater access to affordable housing are necessary to provide a meaningful and equitable HCBS infrastructure.Eliminating estate recovery would give communities of color the opportunity to maintain intergenerational wealth.Data on HCBS currently is very limited, although initial findings suggest that some populations have less access to HCBS. For example, in Wayne County, MI, where Detroit is located, 40% of older adults are people of color, yet they have disproportionately fewer HCBS waivers slots compared to more rural counties and counties with more White residents (Christ & Kean, 2023). State and federal policymakers should review HCBS use to ensure equity in all stages.Lastly, eliminating estate recovery would give communities of color the opportunity to maintain intergenerational wealth by allowing the deceased individuals beneficiaries the opportunity to inherit modest estates. At a minimum, states should exempt estates of modest value and expand hardship exemptions for families that would be impoverished or homeless should recovery occur. Further, LTSS users may be more willing to receive LTSS if estate recovery is eliminated, as the risk of recovery may have a chilling effect, preventing individuals from even applying for Medicaid (MACPAC, 2021).A Final Legal Tool: Robust Anti-Discrimination ProtectionsOne final example of the power of law to fight structural discrimination is through robust anti-discrimination protections. This is important both because of the racism, ableism, and ageism deeply embedded in the history of the programs and services for older adults and people with disabilities, but also because the present-day reality is that the impact of the programs and services is inequitable.Older adults and people with disabilities must have unobstructed, timely, and meaningful access to legal remedies that combat discrimination in real time. This includes the availability of an intersectional private right of action to challenge such discrimination and the recognition of disparate impact theory in legal jurisprudence. Unfortunately, the legal landscape is complex and fractured.As discussed earlier with regard toTalevski, a private right of action is invaluable because it allows the individual who experienced discrimination an opportunity to challenge that by enforcing their rights in court. Our patchwork of civil rights laws has resulted in the availability of private rights of action in some instances, but not others. For example, a private right of action is available under the ADA for discrimination by private entities that provide public accommodations or operate commercial facilities. However, as a result of Supreme Court decisions interpreting Title VIs prohibition on racial discrimination, individuals do not have a private right of action in that context.The limited availability of a private right of action poses challenges to combating discrimination. The impacts of discrimination to an individualloss of dignity and humiliation and disproportionate rates of poverty and poorer health outcomesare pernicious regardless of the protected class in question. As the nature of discrimination evolves, it can become increasingly difficult to ascertainshort of an explicit statement or actiona perpetrators motives, so the law must evolve to account for the ways discrimination has changed. In addition, as an intersectional understanding of discrimination takes hold (i.e., discrimination on the basis of multiple protected identities), the patchwork does not work because inconsistencies between statutes pose challenges for courts, older adults, and people with disabilities to decipher.The difficulty in ascertaining discriminatory intent also confirms the importance of recognizing disparate impact theory in the law. Disparate impact does not require individuals who have experienced discrimination to prove discriminatory intent, but rather, that the challenged policy or practice has the effect of discriminating, even if the means are facially neutral. Disparate impact more accurately reflects the ways in which systems, policies, and programs have been susceptible to discrimination; structural discrimination has been so deeply entrenched over such a long period of time that even facially neutral means can and do lead to inequitable outcomes.For example, a HCBS waiver program that limits slots based upon geography may do so through facially neutral means but could result in people of color having less access because there are fewer waiver slots available in populous areas where communities of color reside. Disparate impact recognizes that as a society, the ways in which discrimination occurs have evolved from the explicit smoking gun that may have been more commonplace during the era of the civil rights movement, moving the focus away from individual actors to emphasize systems thinking and structures.The law has historically played a significant role in protecting individuals from discrimination, giving them access to a court to hear their issue. These values of fairness are underscored in Talevski andGoldberg. However, for the full power of law to be maximally leveraged to advance equity and protect individuals from discrimination, a patchwork approach is insufficient. Instead, as the nature of discrimination evolves and becomes more implicit, robust anti-discrimination protections like intersectional private rights of action and disparate impact theory must be leveraged.Gelila Selassie, JD, is a senior attorney at Justice in Aging, based in Washington, DC.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpecial Edition 2023Reversing the Systemic Tide to Truly Lift All BoatsBy Didier TrinhDecember 06, 2023TagsJustice & EquityAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:Ageism and ableism negatively impact the aging experience, especially for elders from historically marginalized groups (Black, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Hispanic and Latinx, Native American Indian, and LGBTQ+ elders and people with disabilities). This article argues that to enable people of all backgrounds and all disabilities to age with dignity, we need policies and programs that aim to enhance the health and well-being of diverse older adults and their caregivers. At the same time, we must also dismantle long held perceptions and social constructs that perpetuate ageism and ableism.Key Words:ableism, advocacy, ageism, disability, inequity, social justiceAt theDiverse Elders Coalition(DEC), we have intentionally come together as a united front to improve aging in our communities as racially and ethnically diverse people; American Indians and Alaska Natives; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) people. We do this through advocating as a coalition for policies and programs that address systemic inequities, and that advance equity for our communities.This work includes the need to confront and respond to often invisible and pervasive structural ageism and ableism, and their detrimental impacts on elders of different backgrounds and experiences, and on our society as a whole.Our member organizationsNational Asian Pacific Center on Aging (NAPCA), National Caucus and Center on Black Aging, Inc. (NCBA), National Hispanic Council on Aging (NHCOA), National Indian Council on Aging (NICOA), SAGE (Advocacy and Services for LGBTQ+ Elders), and Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC)are experts on the distinctive needs of older adults from the racial, ethnic, political, and cultural communities they represent.Collectively, were working to strengthen policies and programs that will enhance the health and well-being of diverse older adults, while taking an intersectional approachacross racial, sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), and American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) linesto the systemic barriers that continue to undergird persistent disparities and inequities.While as a coalition we have long been leaders at the forefront of social justice and equity in the field of aging, we recognize that, particularly with regard to disability-rights advocacy, we are trying humbly to learn more about how to be better partners and allies. We know all too well that older adults from diverse communities are often also living with a disability and are too often made invisible.Casual Deployment of Ageism and AbleismThe World Health Organization (WHO, 2021) defined ageism as the stereotypes (how we think), prejudice (how we feel) and discrimination (how we act) towards others or oneself based on age. It further stated that intersectionality (as defined by Crenshaw, 1989) can have compounding negative impacts, because ageism intersects and exacerbates other forms of disadvantage including those related to sex, race and disability. The WHO even went so far as to say that ageism is a prevalent and insidious health threat (Span, 2019).While racism and homophobia and/or transphobia are negative constructs that are part of our everyday vernacular, ageism and ableism are much less talked about. The same people who may be very careful not to use racist, homophobic, or transphobic rhetoric often casually deploy or accept ageist and ableist language or attitudes. These insidious forms of discrimination are incredibly damaging for older adults, and for our shared perception of aging as a society.Ageism ranges from everyday microaggressions, like assuming older adults don't understand technology, to more systemic discrimination, like being rejected from a job due to age (Applewhite, 2023; Fulmer et al., 2022). It also is prevalent in healthcare, with nearly 20% of Americans older than age 50 saying they have experienced age-related discrimination, which can result in inappropriate or inadequate care, such as over- and under-treatment, misdiagnosis, and care disparities (Graham, 2021; Rogers et al., 2015).More than 30 years after the ADA was signed, we remain far from achieving equality for people with disabilities.Ableism is characterized by the practices and dominant attitudes in society that devalue and limit the potential of those with disabilities (National Alliance on Mental Illness, n.d.). This includes beliefs that assign inferior value to people who have developmental, emotional, physical, or psychiatric disabilities. Much like ageism, studies have shown that ableism is also pervasive. It shows up as a lack of accessibility or lack of appropriate accommodations in public transportation systems or building designs. It also can manifest in deliberate attitudes that produce and maintain colloquial expressions devaluing those with disabilities.More than 30 years after the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law, we are still far from achieving equality for people with disabilities. This is especially true for people with disabilities who are also people of color and/or whose socioeconomic position could make access to healthcare and other services more challenging. Those with disabilities are forced to navigate systems that were not designed to accommodate all peopleincluding healthcare, housing, employment, education, and criminal justice.As described by the Council on Quality and Leadership in a report on the relationship between ageism and ableism in occupational therapy, Older adults are commonly considered incapable and dependent, which parallels ableist conceptualizations of people with disabilities, where there is an emphasis on impairment, dependence, and inability, rather than a focus on the whole person and environmental barriers . Aging decline and disability are ubiquitous and inevitable, but neither should be the cause for a[n occupational] therapist to think differently of a persons potential to participate in meaningful life activities (Friedman, 2021).We see these damaging attitudes play out every day in our lives and in the headlines. Age (and therefore competency) were regular media topics during the 2020 presidential election, when then-president Donald Trump was already the oldest (at age 74) commander in chief, and then-candidate Joe Biden was 77 (Semones, 2020).The age debate has reignited in earnest once again with former President Trump seeking the Republican nomination in 2024 against sitting President Biden, who has announced his own reelection bid at age 80 (Galston & Kamarck, 2023).After Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) suffered a stroke in the spring of 2022, just days before his successful primary election, he was mocked by his opponents campaign and political pundits for struggling to fully express his thoughts (Astor, 2022). Following his election victory and swearing-in ceremony, Fettermans office announced in February that he was seeking treatment for clinical depression, further fanning the flames of ableist critics who suggested he was unfit to serve in Congress (Ecarma, 2023).At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, now deceased Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), was the subject of intense media scrutiny due to health challenges that prevented her from traveling to Washington, DC, for floor votes (Kenen, 2023). Amid rumors of cognitive decline and calls for her to resign, there also were allegations of ageism and ableism from fellow lawmakers on both sides of the aisle defending Feinsteins right to continue to serve (Blood & Jalonick, 2023; Scott & Solender, 2023).How Ableism and Ageism Impact Already Marginalized Older AdultsBut the impact of ageism and ableism on the communities represented by the DEC is more nuancedand can be more pronouncedbecause it is compounded by the other types of discrimination they have experienced throughout their lives. Denny Chan, managing director for Equity Advocacy at Justice in Aging, helped illustrate this in a guest blog post for the DEC by extrapolating the intersectional characteristics of Dorothy, a 72-year-old Chinese American living in Seattle during the COVID-19 pandemic (Chan, 2020). Dorothy watched anxiously as businesses she frequented in her community began closing or suspending operations, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. She heard about her neighbor being subjected to verbal and physical harassment by strangers for presumably being of Chinese descent, as then-president Trump openly referred to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus (Loofbourow, 2020).Due to her decision to self-quarantine, Dorothy asked her caregiver to stop coming and avoided her local adult day health center. Because she was Limited English Proficient and received much of her information from Chinese newspapers rather than social media, she was unable to access timely pandemic updates.An intersectional framework considers the ways that various forms of inequity operate together, exacerbate each other, and sometimes create unique challenges.Dorothys experience captures the importance and compounding effects of intersectionality, within the context of a global pandemic but also more broadly as a person with several identities trying to make her way in the United States. As Chan (2020) explained, An intersectional framework considers the ways that various forms of inequity operate together, exacerbate each other, and sometimes create unique challenges.A Growing and Diversifying Older Adult PopulationNot only is the U.S. older adult population growing rapidly, but also it is becoming increasingly diverse. According to the most recent U.S. Census, from 2010 to 2020 the share of Americans ages 65 or older rose by more than a third, the fastest increase in 130 years (Caplan, 2023). Over the next two decades, the White (non-Hispanic) older population is expected to increase by 26%, while older racial and ethnic minority populations are expected to grow by 105%, including:Hispanic by 148%;African American (not Hispanic) by 73%;American Indian and Alaska Native (not Hispanic) by 58%; andAsian American (not Hispanic) by 93%. (Administration for Community Living, 2022)More than one-third of adults ages 65 and older have some form of disability, and many need assistance with daily activities such as bathing, eating, toileting, housework, medication management, financial management, and grocery shopping (Christ & Kean, 2021). In fact, nearly half of Americans ages 75 and older and a quarter of those ages 65 to 74 report having a disability (American Community Survey, 2021). Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; n.d.), these are the numbers of adults from racial and ethnic groups who have a disability :3 in 10 American Indians/Alaska Natives1 in 4 Blacks1 in 5 Whites1 in 6 Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders1 in 6 Hispanics, and1 in 10 AsiansAn estimated 3 to 5 million LGBTQ+ people have disabilities, and finding affordable, accessible, and inclusive healthcare services is more challenging for them (Movement Advancement Project, 2019). This is particularly true for those living in rural areas, where LGBTQ+ elders are more likely to have disabilities and be at a higher risk for isolation and discrimination, due to a lack of LGBTQ+-inclusive and fully accessible service providers in their communities.Furthermore, LGBTQ+ people with disabilities often report difficulties in having their identities fully recognized. In spaces focused on disability, their unique experiences as LGBTQ+ people may not be accounted forunderscoring the need for intersectional approaches.Demographics of People in PowerThe lack of age- and disability-inclusive federal policiessuch as a comprehensive national paid family and medical leave program that supports caregiving at all stages of lifeis puzzling given that, like everyone, our political representatives also are older. In the current 118th Congress, the average Senator is age 64; the average age in the U.S. House of Representatives is 57. By the end of this year, 56% of senators and 32% of Representatives will be older than age 65 (Stowe, 2023).Congress also is becoming more diverse (Schaeffer, 2023a). A quarter of voting members in the 118th Congress identify their race or ethnicity as something other than non-Hispanic White. The 118th Congress is the seventh to break the record set by the previous Congressional makeup for racial and ethnic diversity. Overall, 133 Senators and Representatives identify as Black, Hispanic, Asian American, American Indian, or Alaska Native.There also are 13 openly LGBTQ+ members of Congress, which is another record (Schaeffer, 2023b). The Congressional Equality Caucuswhich promotes equality for all people regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics, including intersex traitsis now the largest caucus on Capitol Hill, approaching 200 members.In contrast, in the first-ever quantitative study of disability among American politicians, Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations (2019) researchers found that an estimated 10% of elected officials serving in federal, state, and local governmenta total of nearly 3,800 peoplehave disabilities. That is more than five percentage points lower than the overall disability rate in the adult population. Additionally, the vast majority of politicians with disabilities are White, non-Hispanic men.The underrepresentation of people with disabilities in elected office may be tied to systemic ableism as well as policies that deter political aspirations. While people with disabilities may want to work on a political campaign or even run for office, an existing Social Security Administration (SSA) policy, for example, could disincentivize their interest as they will be ineligible for benefits such as Medicaid or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) by exceeding strict income limits. SSA can consider unpaid campaigning to be work and therefore reduce or completely eliminate a persons federal benefits, such as SSDI.To help address these accessibility and inclusivity issues in federal representation, Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), who chairs the Senate Special Committee on Aging, has introduced federal legislation to enable more people with disabilities to work on campaigns, run for office, and serve in local government:TheRemoving Access Barriers to Running for Elected Office for People with Disabilities Actwould protect federal disability benefits for people with disabilities when they campaign for elected office. The bill would clarify to federal agencies like SSA that campaigning for an elected office does not disqualify a person from receiving disability benefits.TheAID (Accessibility and Inclusion to Diversify) Local Government Leadership Actwould provide local governments with community grants to ensure current and future elected officials with disabilities have access to needed accommodations to perform their duties (Casey, 2022).Just like we need diversity in government by way of race, gender, and other considerations in other categories, said Sen. Casey, we need to make sure that diversity extends to having elected representatives and others in government who are diverse by way of their disability (quoted in Loeppky & Green, 2022).While diversity is improving, there remains a significant lack of adequate representation in the halls of power when compared with the rest of Americaexcept for older adults. Structural ageism and ableism remain rampant.Deep Structural Roots Require Structural ResponsesThese statistics reflect systems and structures that were designed to maintain imbalances in power, wealth, and opportunity since our nations foundingincluding colonialism, capitalism, racism, sexism, homophobia/transphobia, ageism, and ableismto name a few. Over time, policies and practices have served to strengthen and reinforce various forms of structural oppression, rather than upend them.Even the most well-intentioned policymakers have failed to address and break down these longstanding dominant platforms. That is because those in positions of power are typically White, cisgender, straight men without disabilities, attempting to resolve policy dilemmas while being largely informed by that narrow perspective. This naturally leads to less inclusive policies that tend to favor and sustain White, male, non-disabled privilege.Representation matters. Lived experience matters. And when it comes to shaping policies that affect all communities, policymakers should seek to understand the ramifications for all of their constituents. For instance, what if we had more policymakers who were people of color, LGBTQ+, and had a disability? Or what if policymakers heard more frequently from their constituents in marginalized communities, and made a more concerted effort to educate themselves on the profound impact of intersectionality?What if policymakers made a more concerted effort to educate themselves on the profound impact of intersectionality?While acknowledging that affordable digital connectivity is still an everyday obstacle for many older adults, one silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic was the advent of virtual meetings and hearings. With the closure of government buildings and offices, policymakers had to resort to technology to connect with constituents. This resulted in greater access for people in underserved communities to tell their stories, and for lawmakers to hear them. Instead of making time and paying for travel to their state capitals or to Capitol Hill and working out accommodations for disability to participate in person, they could testify on critical issues virtually from their home or workplace.However, now that offices have reopened, policymakers are returning to business as usual. Virtual technology was innovation by necessity that all levels of government adapted toand adoptedduring the pandemic. By reducing or eliminating it altogether, voices that werent being heard will remain silent. At a minimum, hybrid formats should be standardized to help keep marginalized people in the policy debate.Achieving Inclusive and Equitable PolicymakingNow more than ever, we must abandon the longstanding one-size-fits-all approach to policies and practices. This myopic worldview has preserved the ironclad systems and structures we have today, that continue to perpetuate inequities and fail too many (Braveman et al., 2022). By instead looking at policy through an intersectional lens, we will design solutions that are effective for more diverse people and communities with their own nuanced needs.To fulfill the promise of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, a discipline of organizational values that grew out of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, we must embrace what it truly means to be diverse, or differentacross and among age, disability, race, ethnicity, tribal affiliation, language, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics. (See Edmunds and Lind, 2021, for definitions of key terms related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.)Often the most obvious facts are those we tend to easily dismiss or ignore. Each of us is aging all the time, every second of every minute of every day, and with age comes increased disability. If we are lucky, we will all eventually join the very demographic we so callously overlook. We have older people in our lives who are dear to us: grandparents, parents, relatives, neighbors, coworkers, and friends. Many of them we view as our teachers, mentors, supporters, and knowledge keepers. We are quick to say, With age comes wisdom, yet why are we just as quick to associate negative stereotypes with age? And why arent politicians in this demographic doing more to shift the narrative by fundamentally changing how we talk about it?We need more pre-emptive proposals to enable people of all backgrounds and all disabilities to age with dignity. We need more community-based and community-led designs that expand access to services and build resilience. We need to maximize non-discrimination protections for everyone. And we need to do this through policy advocacy at both the legislative and regulatory levels to hold government accountable.The Diverse Elders Coalition envisions a world where all older people can live full and active lives as they age. To make that a reality, we need policies and programs that aim to enhance the health and well-being of diverse older adults and their caregivers. At the same time, we also must dismantle long held perceptions and social constructs that perpetuate ageism and ableism.Didier Trinh is the director of Policy & Advocacy at the Diverse Elders Coalition.

However, many DEI programs lack clarity of purpose and/or clear outcomes, which can negatively impact their effectiveness. This article discusses how a nonprofit focused on LGBTQ+ elder services and advocacy (SAGE) implemented a DEI program and modified its goals to clearly address ageism and ableism in its ongoing work. The article concludes with recommendations for other organizations interested in refining or launching their DEI work.Key Words:ableism, advocacy, ageism, diversity, equity, inclusionIn the wake of the racial justice uprisings triggered by the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, organizations across the United States pivoted quickly to incorporate programs focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into their long-term operations. Though the inequities laid bare by Mr. Floyds killing are, in the American context, not new, the barbaric and very public nature of his Calvary seemed to convince business leaders across sectors that, no matter our profession, we all have a role to play in healing our societys long festering social fissures.In the years since, the political winds have again shifted and an increasing number of pundits, media personalities, and politicians have levied vociferous attacks targeting DEI as a concept. A slew of think pieces have been published by right-leaning publications and authors in recent months that characterize DEI as a Pollyannaish and/or untenable collection of elitist mores that are unrelated at best and detrimental at worst to realizing most businesses core raisons dtre (Butcher, 2023; Maranto et al., 2022). Some commentators went so far as to blame DEI initiatives for the rapid collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in early 2023 (Kessler, 2023; Otten, 2023; Qiu, 2023).While many of these critiques are rooted in unqualified political bias or outright racial animus, I believe there has been a fundamental flaw in the way many organizations have approached the creation and development of their DEI departments. In the summer of 2020, DEI programs were assembled in such haste that many companies seem not to have given themselves time to figure out which specific problems those programs would solve. This has led to the creation of many DEI departments that suffer from a lack of specificity in their objectives. DEI encompasses a wide breadth of work and the termbecause it has become common parlancecan mean very different things to different stakeholders. Specificity is key, and before creating a DEI department, organizations need to have a concrete sense of which issues they are looking to address.SAGEs Incorporation of DEI WorkAt SAGE, we have engaged in a multiyear, organization-wide analysis of where we sit as an organization on matters of equity, representation, and belonging. Through that analysis, we identified specific areas where we can deepen how we work on behalf of and in solidarity with oft marginalized communities including Native Americans, transgender people, and LGBTQ+ elders who live in rural parts of the United States.While recognized as a thought leader on matters pertaining to the unique challenges faced by LGBTQ+ older adults, SAGEs introspective process brought to light that there is more we can do to specifically combat the scourges of ageism and ableism, which represent significant barriers to LGBTQ+ older adults living the lives they want for themselves. In this article, I will share details of the steps we are taking to make an anti-ageist and anti-ableist focus a central part of our work on behalf of and in solidarity with the communities we serve.It is also important to identify the root of the issue you are seeking to address.As is the case at many long-standing nonprofits rooted in community, SAGEs external-facing operations cover a wide range of business areas. When seeking to incorporate a new equity-centric lens into the scope of any organizations work, it is imperative that there be clarity on how this new focus will manifest within each of that companys departments.It is also important to identify the root of the issue you are seeking to address. If you hope to incorporate an anti-racist perspective into your organizations functioning, you first must determine where you will apply this new lens. That is to say, you need to decide whether you are seeking to address racially prejudicial behavior as it manifests internally among staff or to combat racial bias as it affects your constituents. At the end of the day, you may endeavor to address both areas, but the journey to incorporating an anti-racist framework into your operations will differ depending upon whether your focus is internal or external.At SAGE, given the inward-facing equity work we have undertaken in years past, we opted to align our anti-ageist and anti-ableist efforts with our external-facing operations. Thus, our approach to deciding what shape our outward-facing anti-ableist and anti-ageist work would take began by engaging with leadership from our SAGEServes, National Initiatives, Marketing and Communications, Advocacy, and SAGEVenture departments.Our SAGEServes team oversees the provision of programmatic offerings to SAGE constituents primarily in and around New York City, whereas our National Initiatives department leads our organizations research, grant-making, non-NYC housing, and partnership work. Our Marketing and Communications team manages all of SAGEs public-facing messaging and branding, while our Advocacy team works in concert with organizations across the country to push for policies and legislation that positively impact the well-being of LGBTQ+ elders. Our SAGEVenture program directs SAGEs mission-based social enterprise activities.The many branches that form SAGE differ markedly in their area of focus. Thus, seeking to incorporate a new equity principle in ways that do not reflect the nature of our teams work would almost certainly prove unsuccessful in the medium to long term.For our Marketing and Communications team and the research arms of the National Initiatives department, adding an anti-ageist and anti-ableist lens to their work means ensuring that the language in their publications and research instruments avoids terminology that may patronize or otherwise ascribe negative connotations to aging or elders and those with disabilities. With respect to our federal- and state-level advocacy initiatives, we need to analyze where ageist and/or ableist policies infringe upon the human and legal rights of older adults. For SAGEServes and SAGEVenture, anti-ageist/anti-ableist work can examine the assumptions and structural barriers that may prevent certain LGBTQ+ elders from engaging with our programs.After establishing systems, monitoring and periodic assessment are crucial next steps.This ability to preemptively identify how we can improve service delivery was especially crucial in the latter portion of the COVID-19 pandemic when SAGE intentionally decided to continue to expand its suite of virtual services. We realized that while many community members enthusiastically awaited the return of in-person services, there were many SAGE constituents who felt more comfortable engaging virtually. This was especially true for transgender and non-binary eldersgroups that are at greater risk of experiencing verbal, physical, and sexual harassment on public transit (Carathers et al., 2019)and for elders who live in areas without access to reliable transportation.Once it has been decided how each team in your organization will approach the adoption of a new equity lens, the next step is to build systems that remove as much subjectivity as possible from the process of launching anti-ageist and anti-ableist initiatives. For the Marketing and Communications team, compiling examples of affirming as opposed to ageist/ableist terms into our brand guidelines takes the pressure off staff when understanding how ageist and ableist assumptions affect how we speak about older adults and aging. The Advocacy team, on the other hand, may consider setting benchmarks for the number of explicitly anti-ageist/anti-ableist initiatives that they support or sign on to in a given fiscal year.After establishing systems, monitoring and periodic assessment are crucial next steps. Ideally, there will be someone within your organization whose role it is to organize and track equity-related matters. This may not be needed or feasible depending upon your organizations size, but whatever your financial capabilities may be, it is important to designate someoneas part of their official, written job descriptionto be the point person for concerns pertaining to equity and inclusion.I stress the importance of ensuring that this area of work be clearly stated in their job description because expecting an employee or a group of employees to monitor for progress toward equity goals when this is not their realm of expertise, and/or when they are tasked with work in another domain that constitutes their full-time role, will inevitably lead to equity initiatives becoming deprioritized over time.To summarize, if you are looking to establish an intentionally anti-ageist and/or anti-ableist framework into your organizations operations, consider taking the following steps:Start with a team-specific approach. Make sure leaders from each department are brought in from the beginning to garner buy-in and ensure alignment between your goals and the on-the-ground realities and capacities of each department.Focus on systems, not just minds. Encouraging colleagues (and ourselves) to become aware of their and our assumptions around age and disability is a noble and necessary exercise, but to ensure maximum impact of any equity initiative, there must be systems in place that clearly define and incentivize equitable behaviors and praxes.Monitor, measure, and repeat. Once youve built out a system for your organization, make sure you have a method for assessing its efficacy and redesigning it as needed. This is as necessary for your IT department as it is for your DEI team. Establishing and periodically assessing progress toward any equity goal is time consuming, so make sure that carrying out this work is part of an employees or teams role and not added on in a way that will ultimately prove unsustainable.My intention in writing the above is not to overwhelm the reader with theory and the minutiae of team-centric DEI work. Rather, I have sought to demystify what may initially seem like an impossibly ambitious and unwieldy body of work in the hopes that this will equip the reader with the confidence they will need as they seek to create more inclusive and equitable spaces in their professional and personal lives.Bringing about a society that is truly welcoming of all its members is a multigenerational project, but creating meaningful change within your organization can be accomplished with comparative ease if you operate with a clear and well-informed understanding of the challenges at hand.Kylie Madhav, MBA, LMSW, is the senior director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at SAGE in New York, NY.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Vitalii VodolazskyiReferencesButcher, J.

Addressing the needs and aspirations of LGBTQ+ elders requires dismantling structural ageism and ableism. This article explores the roots and impact of ageism and ableism on elders and suggests pathways for mitigating their impact, including building upon decades of experience and learning, and adopting the successful strategies deployed by the disability rights movement.Key Words:ableism, advocacy, ageism, disability rights, discrimination, LGBTQ+LGBTQ+ eldersthe population SAGE represents and servesexperience severe challenges as members of overlapping disadvantaged and marginalized social groups. Through SAGEs work and a growing body of research, we know that LGBTQ+ elders face social isolation; discrimination in healthcare, housing, and employment; disproportionate rates of poverty; health disparities; and lack of access to caregivers and other elder supports. All these challenges are exacerbated for LGBTQ+ elders of color and transgender elders.SAGE was founded to address the needs of LGBTQ+ elders, who were effectively excluded from mainstream service systems and often lacked the care and support system traditionally provided by biological families. Over time, SAGE has expanded to provide a wide variety of programs and services, meals, social interaction, and housing supports. In addition, over the last decade, SAGE has increasingly turned to policy advocacy, training for aging-services providers, and other strategies to combat the systemic barriers facing LGBTQ+ elders.The systemic barriers confronted by LGBTQ+ elders grow out of a pernicious combination of biases, including homophobia, transphobia, ageism, and ableism.Most discussions of ageism focus on social attitudes and individual experiences of discrimination. But ageism is not just a reflection of attitudes. Like racism and gender bias, ageism is a system of awarding social, economic, and other forms of privilege. Ageism is part of the institutions and the legal frameworks that organize our society. Currently, this structural aspect of ageism is under-emphasized in discussions of and advocacy on elder issues. This prevents many advocacy efforts from recognizing and challenging the root causes of age-based inequity.Ableismthe bias against people who have, have had in the past, or are viewed as having, a disabilityis an essential element of ageism. Most people as they age experience one or more disabilities, encountering similar challenges to those faced by younger people with disabilities. Also, many of the assumptions, stereotypes, and negative attitudes about disability mirror those about aging. Simply put, one cannot advocate for elders, and against ageism, without considering ableism.Just as we must take a structural and systemic approach to challenging anti-LGBTQ+ bias, we need to embrace a structural understanding and approach to ageism that includes ableism. This article will explore these ideas and begin a conversation about how to put them into practice.What Is Structural Bias?Structural treatments of bias first gained attention in the 1960s. Kwame Ture and Charles Hamilton highlighted the concepts of systemic and structural racism with Black Power: The Politics of Liberation (1967). They argued that racism is based on both individual attitudes and structures within society and that while individual racism can often be easily identified, the structural barriers are so entrenched that they may be invisible and widely accepted. The concept of structural racism has evolved since the 1960s and today is understood as social, economic, and legal policies, practices, and institutions that disadvantage people because of their race or ethnicity (Bouie, 2021). For example, the fact that many neighborhoods have few residents of color is not just a reflection of local attitudes but also the result of historic practices of lending, subsidizing, marketing, and selling property that systematically excluded people of color. These structures did not arise by accident. They were designed to protect and enshrine racial segregation and White supremacy.One cannot advocate for elders, and against ageism, without considering ableism.In the 1970s and 1980s, feminist thinkers applied structural bias to understand the roots of gender inequality and legal, economic, political, and domestic institutions that empower men, and their historical control over inheritance and family, while disempowering women, eventually recognizing that the terms men and women are themselves socially constructed (Millett, 1970). Radical feminist theory led to the growth of queer studies, which advanced an understanding of gender oppression as institutional and structural.Structural bias continues to be studied in many different contexts, including structural racism in healthcare (Brown et al., 2016), housing (Rothstein, 2017), and criminal justice (Bishop, 2020); and structural sexism in healthcare (Dusenbery, 2017), employment (Tankersley, 2018), and education (Davis & Reynolds, 2018).Structural Ageism Is EverywhereWhile age-based discrimination is prohibited in equal-employment opportunity laws (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2023), ageism often is seen as an issue of ageist attitudes, held by specific individuals, that can be addressed with training, lists of dos and donts, and elders self-empowerment.But ageism goes beyond negative attitudes about aging and elders; it is embedded in our laws and social structures, which essentialize youth while marginalizing and disempowering elders. Ageism is how society operationalizes the view of elders as less valuable, less deserving of resources, and as excluded from our general society and communities, just as ableism does to people with disabilities, and homophobia and transphobia to LGBTQ+ people.We see examples of ageist structures everywhere. According to AARP, 64% of elders have experienced or witnessed age discrimination at work and 56% are fired or coerced to resign at some point once they pass the age of 50 (Choi-Allum, 2022). Professional-services firms (among others) and even some government agencies still have mandatory retirement ages. Much like LGBTQ+ workers and people with disabilities, older employees are often excluded from training opportunities, communication, and choice assignments. And only 8% of U.S. companies include ageism in their DEI initiatives (Gerhardt et al., 2022).Structural ageism manifests in municipalities spending decisions, which frequently invest little in amenities like paratransit, benches, and public bathrooms that make it possible for older adults to move freely in their communities while addressing their physical needs. Barriers in the built environment serve to exclude older adults from comfortably inhabiting public spaces.Commerce also communicates and reinforces ageism. Marketing and product development is overwhelmingly geared toward younger people even though 56 cents of every dollar spent in the U.S. comes from a consumer age 50 or older (Choi-Allum, 2022). Despite their extraordinary spending power, in the rare cases when older people do appear in advertisements, they often are portrayed in denigrating ways, as incapable, out of touch, or unpleasant. This kind of messaging reinforces ageist attitudes at scale, which become embedded in a self-reinforcing cycle.Structural ageism is particularly evident in healthcare. Elders have a hard time accessing medical care. Often they have trouble obtaining care for medical problems because their symptoms are dismissed as natural aspects of aging and, like people with disabilities, often they are denied services routinely provided to others. A study of 9,000 hospitalized patients revealed that healthcare professionals were significantly more likely to withhold life-sustaining treatments from older patients, even after controlling for prognosis and patient preferences (Inouye, 2021).SAGE adopted the principle that elder voices come first as a core organizational value.Many hospitals have policies to avoid using feeding tubes for older patients, instead referring them to terminal care (Inouye, 2021). Similarly, there are formal and informal age limits on HIV testing (Fitzpatrick, 2011), vaccines (Lloyd-Sherlock et al., 2022), and some medical procedures (Pelham, 2023). And many insurance companies refuse to authorize surgery or exploratory procedures, such as sleep apnea tests, for older patients that are routinely approved for younger people (Wyman et al., 2018).Structural ageism impacts every aspect of life, from the built environment of our communities to business practices and what products are available to the mental and physical well-being (and life expectancy!) of older people.Ageist Systems and Policies Can Be Used to Take Away Elders AutonomyAgeism includes assumptions that older people are less capable of living independent lives. Increased dependency is sometimes a reality in the aging process, and dependency unfortunately invites abuse. As a result, systems have been created to protect older adults from abuse. But according to the American Bar Association, abuse of the guardianship and elder-protection system is common enough that it has its own nickname, silver collar crimes, and the Florida Attorney Generals office has a department dedicated to investigating them (Palmieri, 2021). In 2017, a real estate agent was convicted of perjury and theft for using her relationship with local courts, social workers, and medical providers to have herself appointed the legal guardian for scores of elders, who were generally fully competent and independent. She would then move them to care facilities and sell their homes and possessions for her own profit (Aviv, 2017).While it is essential to have systems in place to address the reality and risk of elder abuse, ageism manifests in systems that can unnecessarily withdraw autonomy from elders.Ageist assumptions can overwhelm actual data about older peoples capabilities. In New York State, anyone can lodge an anonymous complaint with the Department of Motor Vehicles alleging that an older driver is not competent (New York State Office for the Aging, 2019). Regardless of the merit of the complaint, the driver is required to take a new road test to keep their license; even when studies show older drivers are safer than young drivers (Steed, 2021). Protection is important, but systems that are open to manipulation and infected by ageism often become structures that reinforce and multiply ageist practices.Ageism Also Shows Up in the Aging SectorThe insidious and systematic nature of ageism is evidenced by the fact that we see it even in the aging sector, which can treat elders as dependent and passive, needing to be managed, and forced to comply with the choices providers think are best. Examples include paternalistic provider policies prohibiting older adults from making basic human choices about what they eat and drink and where, when, and with whom they seek out sexual intimacy. Like people with disabilities, older people are frequently relegated to restrictive care facilities and protocols. Too often, elders are not viewed as active members of society, but as people who need support, a message that can paint them as resource drains or burdens rather than contributors to their communities.Historically, we sometimes have seen examples of this in the promotional efforts of nonprofits in the aging sector, which are cash-strapped. The image of the helpless elder can be exploited to good effect in fundraising and publicity. To attract donations and other forms of support, victim-oriented messages emphasize illness, dependency, and plight. While sometimes effective in attracting resources and attention to organizations that desperately need both, these messages reinforce ageist stereotypes and are dehumanizing.We also see the structures of ageism in aging-advocacy organizations, which like most nonprofits often are overwhelmingly staffed and led by younger people. It is all too easy to make decisions without consulting with and being guided by elders. The importance of combating these trends is why SAGE adopted the principle that elder voices come first as a core organizational value.At the IntersectionsMost of us wish to live a long life. Living longer usually means experiencing disability in some form, whether it be reduced vision or hearing, mobility issues, or chronic health conditions. More than half of older Americans will experience a disability that requires up to 2 years of long-term services and supports; about 1 in 7 older Americans will experience a disability for more than 5 years (Office of Behavior Health, Disability and Aging Policy, 2021). So, when we think about dignified, inclusive aging, we must include disability.Incorporating anti-ageist and disability-rights perspectives into SAGEs work with and on behalf of LGBTQ+ elders is an effort to work at the intersections of these overlapping lived experiences and advocacy areas. It means challenging long-standing and overlapping biases about aging, disability, and LGBTQ+ identity.It is deeply painful for LGBTQ+ older adults to find themselves rejected by the communityand its welcoming, shared spacesthey helped make possible.One area in which this shows up is in stereotypes about sexual intimacy. A narrow view of sexual orientation is that it is based solely on sexual desire and activity, rather than reflecting a full range of relational preferences and an essential part of ones identity that inspires personal pride. In an ableist and ageist world, sexual intimacy is presumed to be confined to young, able-bodied people. Because LGBTQ+ people are stereotypically defined by their sexual orientation, the ageist and ableist framework makes it oxymoronic and unimaginable that someone could be older, disabled, queer, and a sexual being who needs culturally competent care.The misconception that elders and people with disabilities exist outside the spectrum of human sexuality can erase the existence of LGBTQ+ people in both communities. And it has real consequences for how they receive care. In some cases, it can manifest in cognitive dissonance for elder and disability-related service providers when theyre asked to be LGBTQ+-welcoming. Within the framework of ableism and ageism, the frequent response that we dont have people like that here is better understood (while woefully misguided).At the same time, elements of LGBTQ+ communities that have historically prized youth and normative physical beauty also participate in biased behavior and erect structural barriers to access. Until recently, the social locus for many gay men was the bar scene, which historically was unwelcoming of older people and rarely accessible to people with disabilities. This also has been true for other kinds of LGBTQ+ social spaces, including community centers and service providers, where older adults often lament that they have aged out of social relevance and become invisible, even as their need for support and community grows. SAGE constituents often recount that once they reach a certain age, they no longer feel welcome in a wide range of community spaces. Not surprisingly, it is deeply painful for LGBTQ+ older adults to find themselves rejected by the communityand its welcoming, shared spacesthey helped make possible.Similarly, people with visible disabilities often feel they are not valued and are rejected by a hook-up culture. As a result, LGBTQ+ people with disabilities have sometimes formed their own communities.LGBTQ+ elders experience the overlapping biases of anti-LGBTQ+ bias, bias within their own community, ageism, and ableism. Recognizing the interplay of these biases and how they are structurally embedded is essential to advocating effectively with and on behalf of LGBTQ+ older people.Learning From the Disability-Rights MovementWhen we think about how to unravel structural bias, its helpful to turn to the disability-rights movement, which shares many themes and issues relevant to anti-ageism work and efforts for greater dignity for LGBTQ+ elders. The disability-rights movement was largely defined by challenging structural barriers, both physical and institutional. The physical barriersincluding an environment not accessible to wheelchair users, and a lack of braille signage and sign-language interpreters, and public accommodations that arent set up for Little Peoplewere largely accepted until the 1970s and 1980s. Although physical and institutional barriers still exist, the disability-rights movement has made significant progress in the intervening decades.Behind the physical barriers were institutional barriers. Historically, the approach to disabled people mirrored the approach to elders and other marginalized groups like the LGBTQ+ community: out of sight, out of mind. People with disabilities were systematically excluded from education, employment, and the community and often secluded in care institutions with problematic conditions and practices.The disability-rights movements focus on discriminatory and exclusionary institutions and structures led to the identification of ableism in society. Ableism assumes that typical abilities are superior; it defines people by their disability and assumes that they need fixing, or to be put away from society and denied control over their own life decisions (Davis, 2006).Until the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, there were basically no civil rights protections for people with disabilities in the United States. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibited discrimination against people with disabilities and mandated that recipients of federal funding make accommodations (Office for Civil Rights, 2006). This meant, for example, that universities and hospitals had to treat people with disabilities like other students, patients, and employees and provide adaptations that allowed them to be fully integrated.This paved the way for the first comprehensive civil rights law for people with disabilities in the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Organizing for the ADA began in the 1980s and gained momentum until its passage in 1990. It was passed thanks to the active and visible organizing and grassroots protest of large numbers of people with disabilities across the country. During the struggle for the ADA, important links were formed between the disability-rights movement and the LGBTQ+ community over ensuring that the law would cover people living with HIV/AIDS.Like ageism and anti-LGBTQ+ bias, one effect of ableism is that people with disabilities are denied autonomy and independence. The disability-rights movement asks that, rather than thinking of disability as defined by what someone can or cannot do, instead we think of it as defined by what a person can or cannot access in a world designed to exclude them. This same thinking can be used to inspire inclusive systems and structures that acknowledge and respect people of all ages, abilities, sexual orientations, and gender identities.ConclusionAgeism and ableism are structural phenomena that negatively shape the lived experiences of LGBTQ+ older adult and older people from all communities. Addressing the needs and aspirations of LGBTQ+ elders requires dismantling structural ageism and ableism. This is easier said than done, among other reasons because structures of marginalization are invisible to many and often are assumed to be givens and necessities.Fortunately, in seeking to confront and defeat structural ageism and ableism, LGBTQ+ older adults and their allies are not breaking entirely new ground. Instead, we can build upon decades of experience and learning, including from movements to dismantle structural racism and the successful strategies deployed by the disability rights movement. A key starting point is naming and lifting up the ideas that ageism-induced and ableism-induced challenges confronting LGBTQ+ older people are not just the result of biased attitudes but also perpetuated and reinforced by structures and systems. Naming this reality is the foundational first step to crafting effective strategies to dismantle those structures so that all LGBTQ+ older peopleand all older adultscan thrive in a world of boundless opportunities for each of us as we age.Michael Adams is the CEO of SAGE.

GuttermanDecember 06, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:The world has experienced an unprecedented increase in average life expectancy and population aginga revolution in longevity that brings both opportunities and challenges. And for many older adults, aging brings impairments that cannot be avoided. As such, society must deal with a new demographic reality, yet the response is hindered by ageism and ableism, and the risks and indignities are greatest for those who live where those isms intersect. This article discusses ageism and ableism, the steps to take to address each of them, and suggests what advocates for older and disabled persons can learn from one another.Key Words:ableism, advocacy, ageism, elders rights, disability, discriminationAs of 2015, the number of adults older than age 60 was 906 million worldwide, representing 12.3% of the world population, and the United Nations (UN) has projected that by 2050, 1 in 6 people in the world will be older than age 65 (Population Division, 2019).Not all older persons are disabled, nor is disability limited to older people, but the intersectionality of age and disability is an area of focus that will only grow in importance in years to come. The proportion of people with disabilities worldwide has been reliably estimated to be around 1 in 6, and according to a UN report from 2018, more than 46% of older persons worldwide have an impairment (250 million experience moderate to significant impairments; Population Division, 2018). Also, older adults represent the majority of the population of persons with disabilities (Population Division, 2018, p. 48).The world has experienced an unprecedented increase in average life expectancy and population aging, a revolution in longevity bringing opportunities and challenges that will be influenced and impeded by ageism. According to the World Health Organization (WHO; 2021):Ageism refers to the stereotypes (how we think), prejudice (how we feel) and discrimination (how we act) directed towards people on the basis of their age. It can be institutional, interpersonal or self-directed. Institutional ageism refers to the laws, rules, social norms, policies and practices of institutions that unfairly restrict opportunities and systematically disadvantage individuals because of their age. Interpersonal ageism arises in interactions between two or more individuals, while self-directed ageism occurs when ageism is internalized and turned against oneself.The Impact of Structural AgeismAll the levels of ageism mentioned above are important to understand; however, elders rights movements correctly focus a good deal of attention on institutional ageism, often called structural ageism.According to Becca Levy (2022), [s]tructural, or institutional, ageism is not only one of the most potent forms of bias that exists today, but also one of the least acknowledged. She quoted a 2021 report by the WHO that concluded, Often people fail to recognize the existence of such institutional ageism because the rules, norms and practices of the institution are long-standing, have become ritualized and are seen as normal.Ryan Backer and Iggy Chang (2022) explained that ageism at the structural level operates in the form of discriminatory social policies. These are macro-level policies and practices, such as reliance upon the concept of dependency ratios, which discriminate against or restrict resources and opportunities for older persons while promulgating unsupported stereotypes that older persons do not contribute to the economy. And prejudicial norms against older persons propagated by societal institutions can also include age-based biases of individuals who are part of these larger societal institutions, such as policy makers or health care providers (Backer & Chang, 20220, pp. 4849).Backer and Chang (2022) noted that structural ageism impacts the lives of older persons in a number of ways beyond the well-documented injurious health effects, including unjustified exclusion from day-to-day activities of life, creation of a hostile and invalidating social environment, and promulgation of negative age beliefs among older persons themselves that ultimately lead to adverse health, behavioral, and quality of life outcomes.Backer and Chang also pointed out that ageism often works side by side with ableism, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. Ableism has been defined by the Center for Disability Rights (n.d.) as a set of beliefs or practices that devalue and discriminate against people with physical, intellectual, or psychiatric disabilities and often rests on the assumption that disabled people need to be fixed in one form or the other.Ageism often works side by side with ableism, making it difficult to distinguish between the two.The Law Commission of Ontario (2023) described ableism as: a belief system, analogous to racism, sexism, or ageism, that sees persons with disabilities as being less worthy of respect and consideration, less able to contribute and participate, and of less inherent value than others (p. 100).An article inMedical News Today(Villines, 2021) noted that examples of ableism range from blatant hostility and aggression to less obvious everyday interactions. At the individual level this can include: asking someone what is wrong with them; saying, you dont look disabled, as though this is a compliment; viewing a person with a disability as inspirational for doing typical things, such as having a career; assuming a physical disability is a product of laziness or lack of exercise; using public facilities such as parking spaces or toilets that are for people with disabilities; questioning whether a persons disability is real; using ableist language (dumb and lame); and misusing words in ways that trivialize impairments (e.g., I am so OCD.).In addition to the personal insults that people with disabilities must endure alongside constant exclusion and underestimation, they also must cope with and attempt to overcome structural ableism.Writing inForbesin 2021, Andrew Pulrang observed, even after decades of progress against ableism, people with disabilities still face significant barriers to social inclusion, equal opportunity, health and safety, and financial security [and] while some of the most visible efforts to continue the fight focus on changing ableist habits and attitudes, the most harmful and persistent barriers disabled people face are still distinctly structural.Claudia Mahler, the current UN independent expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons, noted, ableism, a value system that considers certain characteristics of body and mind as essential to live a life of value, is often conflated with ageism, and that, older persons with disabilities may have access to fewer or different services, experience age cut-offs for disability benefits and personal assistance, and face an increased likelihood of institutionalization compared with their younger peers with disabilities (Mahler, 2021, p. 11).Mahler (2021) conceded that the biological process of aging includes an increased likelihood of disability; however, she expressed concern that seeing ill health as a symptom of older age instead of as a medical condition that merits treatment leads to older persons being excluded from appropriate healthcare services including preventive screening, surgical treatment, rehabilitation services, and organ transplant.Catalina Devandas-Aguilar, who from 2014 to 2020 served as the first U.N. special rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, also discussed the intersectionality of aging and disability, noting that given that the number of persons over the age of 80 years is expected to more than triple by 2050, the correlation between the ageing population and increased rates of disability is very clear (Devandas-Aguilar, 2019, para. 4).She wrote that although ageism and ableism share common roots and consequences, inequality in older age is not the mere result of ableist biases [and] ageismthe stereotyping of, and prejudice and discrimination towards, older people and older ageis a distinct form of oppression that affects older persons, including older persons with disabilities.According to Devandas-Aguilar (2019), while disability is increasingly understood as a social construct, inequalities due to old age are predominantly seen as natural or inevitable, which leads to older persons with disabilities [being] discriminated against and disadvantaged not just because they have a disability, but also because of stereotypes about older people (para. 7).Combating Ableism and AgeismIn the JanuaryFebruary 2023 issue ofGenerations Today, Ashton Applewhite (2023) noted, The intersection of ageism and ableism is where many of our darkest fears reside. Illness. Incontinence. Indignity. She added, its also where we encounterin direct proportion to those fearsthe potential for personal liberation and collective activism.Indeed, the prescriptions for combating ableism and ageism are strikingly similar and it is clear that activists for people with disabilities and older persons can learn a great deal from one another. For example, the above-referenced article inMedical News Todaycalled for an extensive campaign to combat ableism at the individual and structural levels that would include learning about disabilitywhat it means and how it affects people learning about ableism, ableist stereotypes, and the history of disability rights activism listening to people with disabilities share their experiences challenging ableism as it happens, for example, by correcting a myth or stopping bullying giving people with disabilities a platform, or passing the mic, instead of speaking for them advocating for accessibility and inclusivity [and] enacting policies or laws that counter ableism (Villines, 2021).Ageism challenges people who are much younger and appears to be getting worse, no thanks to the wicked turn of tone in the media world.At the same time, there is a growing consensus on the key elements of an effective campaign against structural ageism. At the national level, the focus is on identifying and combating discriminatory social policies, prejudicial social norms, and countries, by protecting the economic rights of older persons through pension-reform laws and raising retirement benefits of workers, recognizing and protecting the social rights of older persons through national policies that include healthy aging as a priority policy, protecting the civil rights of older persons by enacting and enforcing laws and policies to prevent discrimination against older workers, and protecting the political rights of older persons through constitutional-level protection against age discrimination (Chang et al., 2021).In itsGlobal Report on Ageismissued in 2021, the WHO called for policies and laws that address age discrimination and inequality, educational interventions to reduce ageism across all levels and types of education, support for intergenerational contacts between people of different generations, and improving data and research to achieve a better understanding of ageism (pp. xv, xviixviii). Issues relating to older persons have been integrated into the generic international human rights framework and emerging regional human rights legal systems and there has been recognition of the fact that the special circumstances of older persons should be taken into consideration when developing social and economic policies.There also is a growing consensus regarding the need for explicit recognition of the specific rights of older persons in the form of an international convention or treaty that would raise the profile of the issues, serve as a basis for action in different contexts, and empower advocates and members of that group to act. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has often been mentioned as a valuable framework for the proposed, but long delayed, UN Convention on the Human Rights of Older Persons.The battle for dignity and realization of civil and human rights is difficult for people with disabilities and older adults, and even harder for those who fall within both groups. The observations of Devandas-Aguilar (2019) are informative:The age at which people experience disability influences their sense of identity as well as societal perceptions of them. Those who acquire impairments when older seldom self-identify as persons with disabilities and are more likely to perceive the decline of their physical and cognitive functioning as a normal part of ageing. For people who acquired impairments earlier in life and have grown old, older age is a secondary identity; they may therefore have very different expectations about older age.These distinct individual experiences and perceptions are also reflected in the ways in which the disability and the aging communities address the intersection between aging and disability. Although both movements are beginning to have increased exchanges, in general they continue to address the situation of older persons with disabilities differently: while the disability rights community often does not adequately reflect the interests and challenges faced by older persons, the older persons movement often fails to understand and apply the human rightsbased approach to disability. Consequently, older persons with disabilities frequently fall through the cracks (para. 6).Regrettably, too many people can truthfully say something like the following about their day-to-day lives: Its not age (disability) that stops me, its ageism (ableism).While the numbers above use traditional retirement ages, such as 60 or 65, to measure the size of the group that might be vulnerable to ageism, the reality is that ageism challenges people who are much younger and appears to be getting worse. Some of this can be credited to the wicked turn of tone in the media world, even as it becomes clear that the future is a society in which older persons will be a permanent part of demography and society.I am in my late 60s and ageism has become a daily hurdle for me, even though I like to think Im in good health and more engaged than ever in my professional interests. The ugliness of ableism has become apparent to me as I help my wife navigate her day-to-day world and, because she is the same age as me, she must put up with the indignities that abound at the intersection of ageism and ableism which, not surprisingly, are far worse for women.We cannot settle for this. We must do better, and I hope this Generations Journal issue contributes to the cause that should be taken up by and on behalf of older persons with disabilities and those who care for them.Alan S.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpecial Edition 2023Our Guest Editors: Committed to the Case Against Structural AgeismBy Alison BiggarDecember 06, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureJustice & EquityThe two guest editors of SAGEs 2023 Supplement toGenerations Journalon Structural Ageism are deep thinkers who have turned their attention to the structures in our society that allow ageism to flourish.Michael Adams has since 2006 been the CEO of SAGE and served on ASAs Board of Directors for a decade, chairing it from 2020 to 2022. Prior to SAGE Adams was director of Education & Public Affairs for Lambda Legal, and had already spent a decade as an LGBTQ+ rights litigator, at the ACLU and at Lambda Legal.Having seen in the aging sector how the predominant understanding of ageism has zeroed in on social attitudes, which clearly need to evolve, Adams said, I believe we have missed an important part of the story by not focusing enough attention on the systems and structures that reinforce ageism.Much like systemic racism, the systems and structures are pernicious because on their face they seem neutral, and thus often are not recognized. Ive spent considerable time, said Adams, working on strategies to shine a spotlight on the structural aspects of ageism, and how we can deconstruct systemic ageism inside our organizations, in our field, and in our society.Rani Kronick comes at the work from the writerly end of things, as a political scientist, writer, researcher and editor, who has been active in civil and human rights struggles for years. As a political scientist her tendency is to focus on the structural basis of social issues, and much of her working life has been spent analyzing and commenting on the biases elders encounter and on the struggles to change the laws and institutions that perpetuate it.The glaring obviousness of structural ageism, along with the lack of attention it attracts, makes me particularly passionate about education and advocacy to combat it, said Kronick. She also has spent time working with the Diverse Elders Coalition and in the disability-rights movement. Both experiences have shown her how different forms of structural bias intersect with and reinforce one another.The resilience of the communities affected make me believe that we can, with hard work, make progress in ending structural ageism, Kronick said.Its equally important that we build an action agenda to do everything we can to eradicate ageism and ableism in our world.The guest editors personal lives also contribute to their passion on the topic. Adams is a gay man in his 60s who increasingly sees how ageism intersects with his experiences as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, which only serves to increase his desire to change the status quo.Kronick often lives with her 92-year-old father and sees his and his siblings struggles with the institutions they depend upon and the laws that regulate their lives as older adults. Shes just beginning to face similar issues as a late middle-ager. But as someone who has confronted structural ableism much of her life, shes now seeing the commonalities between biases against older adults and those against people with disabilities.This issue provides a rare opportunity to bring together diverse perspectives on structural ageism and its intersections with other forms of bias, said Kronick, who hopes the issue will be instrumental in educating aging-services professionals about the issue and provide a new way for them to understand issues they encounter with their clients and in their work.Adams agreed, mentioning that its essential to shine a much bigger spotlight on the realities of structural ageism and ableism from an intersectional perspectiveboth how ageism and ableism intersect with one another and how they affect elders who are members of marginalized communities. Its equally important that we build an action agenda to do everything we can to eradicate ageism and ableism in our world.Kronick noted that although the terms ageism and ageist have entered our social discourse, they are usually seen as reflections of individual attitudes or poor word choices. While these social attitudes are real, they are based on and perpetuated by institutions and structures (including laws, historic practices, rules and regulations) that limit elders choices and autonomy so profoundly that they are not always perceived by the victims, she said.Removing these structures is challenging, added Kronick, but I truly believe the more we talk about them, and connect them to other forms of bias, the closer we come to achieving real solutions.These guest editors ensured that this issue of Generations Journal brought together an impressive cross-section of contributors who provide powerful analysis on how to understand the operation of structural ageism and ableism from multiple social perspectives. And it offers several strategic approaches and blueprints for how to translate these important understandings into transformational change.My hope, said Adams, is that the issue will encourage conversation and debate about theory, and also spark advocacy and action.Alison Biggar is ASA's Editorial Director.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Anastasiia GusevaYou may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSpecial Edition 2023Human-centered Design to Address Ageism and Ableism in Rural AmericaBy Sara CantorDecember 06, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureJustice & EquityAbstract:Despite the abundance of older peoplemany with disabilitiesliving in them, rural communities in the United States are not prepared to care for elders needs. Elders and people with disabilities in rural communities face structural barriers to vital resources like healthy food, medical care, and transportation. This article explores how a human-centered design (HCD) process can circumvent entrenched ageism and ableism to yield creative solutions that positively impact everyone in a community, using the successful roll-out of a healthy food initiative in Wilkesboro, NC, as a case study.Key Words:ableism, advocacy, ageism, human-centered design, innovation, ruralOlder adults and people with disabilities living in rural areas are some of the most isolated and underserved residents in U.S. society. This may not seem surprising, considering the resource scarcity many rural communities face. However, the proportion of people older than age 65 is higher in rural areas than it is in urban ones, and older adults in the United States disproportionately choose to live in rural areas, which begs the question:Why arent rural communities better designed for aging?Rural communities, which comprise no less than 97% of the total land area of the United States (Ratcliffe et al., 2016), and host about a fourth of the nations elders, are particularly ill-equipped to support an aging population. They tend to lack sufficient healthcare capacity, transportation and mobility supports, internet connectivity, and social services (Skoufalos et al., 2017).I dont think [rural communities] were meant to be places with such a high concentration of elderly people, said Johnathan Hladik, policy director at theCenter for Rural Affairs. They were meant for people of all ageseveryone else just left (J. Hladik, personal communication, June 29, 2023).We see the impacts of these gaps on quality of life: compared to urban residents, rural older adults have lower socioeconomic status and poorer health (Singh & Siahpush, 2014). While elders in rural areas report having larger social networks than those in urban areas, they also report higher levels of loneliness, which indicates structural barriers to connecting (Henning-Smith et al., 2019). In other words,the people are not the problem. Rather, its community designprograms, policies, systems, and infrastructurethat prevents people from thriving with disability and old age.Rural Design Means Constant InnovationSupporting rural elders to thrive through community redesign requires a deep understanding of their unique needs and capacities. Interventions that work well in urban areas typically require adaptation. One well-known programmatic example of this comes from Meals on Wheels. In urban areas, volunteers typically drop off meals with older adults daily. But in rural communities, the geographic service areas are often much larger, so one tweak has been to deliver more meals, less frequentlysuch as a weeks worth of food on every Monday. Another recent pilot sets up satellite sites in the community where food can be left and stored safely, until volunteers pick it up. In one mountainous area, this intervention reduced volunteers driving by 70 miles (C. Florence, personal communication, 2023).Necessity is the mother of all invention. It was about ensuring that we could extend resources and make the biggest impact with the least amount of cost, said Carter Florence, vice president of programs at Meals on Wheels America (C. Florence, personal communication, June 16, 2023).We can pair demographic data and trends with a deep understanding of residents lived experiences and create innovations to circumvent crises.Sometimes well-intentioned services see barriers to adoption because constraints are placed on the people and context in which they would be used. For example, many paratransit systems will only take riders to the grocery store, the pharmacy, or the clinic. This reflects a very limited view of elders needs, and does not recognize older adults and people with disabilities as having full, organic lives that may require, for example, attending a social event on Tuesday, an AA meeting on Friday, and a political town hall on Saturday.We dont have to wait for necessity to birth new inventions. We can pair demographic data and nationwide trends with a deep understanding of residents lived experiences and create innovations to circumvent crises. This article introduces human-centered design (HCD) as one approach to understanding and designing for lived experience. HCD is a process that creates programs, policies, and systems alongside the people they are intended to benefit. Not only does it illuminate assumptions and blind spots, when facilitated in a co-creative manner, this approach leads to transformative solutions that challenge the status-quo narratives of ageism, ableism, and other oppressive structures.Designing Alongside ResidentsAt Greater Good Studio, the human-centered design firm I lead, we believe that HCD is a tool for building constructive relationships between groups with different levels of access to power in society. Its a methodology for bridging the gap between the people making decisions and the people affected by those decisions. And its a process for rigorously co-designing alongside the people one aims to serve, whether they are rural elders, bus drivers, home health workers, or any other group with unique and unmet needs.We used HCD to envision and co-create healthier communities through an 18-month project called Raising Places. Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the project was designed to answer the question, What does it take to create places where children and families can thrive?While Raising Places started with a focus on one vulnerable group, children living in poverty, the same approach can be applied to older adults and people with disabilities who live in rural areas. Some of the best solutions turned out to meet the needs of all of these groups.Place-Based Design in Rural Wilkes CountyOne of the six Raising Places community sites was North Wilkesboro, NC, a small, geographically isolated town of about 4,200 people in rural Appalachia. Nestled in the foothills of the Brushy Mountains, its physical beauty masks the economic hardships of its residents. Beginning in the 1990s, local employers and manufacturers in town either closed or relocated to larger markets. Today, the county ranks in thetop 25 most economically distressed in the state(North Carolina Department of Commerce, 2022).To engage in Raising Places, the local convening organization,The Health Foundation, recruited a group of local leaders we named the Design Team. None of these folks had formal design expertise. Rather, the 10 design team members in North Wilkesboro came from across disciplines and institutions. What they shared was a vested interest in improving their community, particularly for its most marginalized residents.Reframing the Problem, From a Residents PerspectiveDesign is often understood as a problem-solving process, but this overlooks a critical first step: agreeing on the problem to be solved. The North Wilkesboro design team started with a well-known issue in town: lack of access to healthy food. They defined their community as a food desert, and at thekickoff workshop, when we asked them to write a positive goal, they drafted, We want all families in North Wilkesboro to know where their next meal is coming from, and to have it be healthy.However, their next step was eye-opening for all involved. One of the most important aspects of HCD is learning directly from the people most affected by the problem at hand. The design team recruited about a dozen neighbors, who they would ask to accompany on shopping trips and family meals. They wanted to better understand the everyday lived experiences of these residents, specifically low-income residents, as they related to food: its planning, purchase, and consumption.What are the ways that different levers in society might be pulled to prevent this from happening again?One of the design team members, Greta Ferguson of the North Wilkesboro Housing Authority, arranged to accompany April Burns, one of the older residents, on a grocery shopping trip. Ferguson suggested that they meet at the store, to which Burns replied, No, you will meet me at my bus stop. Burns lived only about a mile and a half from the store, but the bus ride took 90 minutes. To her, this was a routine shopping trip, but to Ferguson, it was unacceptable.Are you kidding me? says Ferguson. I was like, It doesnt have to be like this (G. Ferguson, personal communication, June 29, 2023).Fergusons proximity to Burns and her experience allowed her to understand the situation differently than had she been presented with bus usage numbers or statistics on local rates of diabetes.Viscerally, she felt that the situation was wrong.That by ignoring the riders experience, the bus system policies were upholding ageism and ableism. She felt certain that healthy eating wasnt being hindered by an individual lack of education, but by a structural lack of access. And now, both she and Burns were activated to do something about it.No Bad IdeasWith a new understanding of the barriers to eating well, Ferguson and her fellow design team members came to the second workshop ready to brainstorm. After community research, the next stage of HCD is ideation. As soon as we are aligned on the right problem to solve, a common next move is to come up with the one idea that will best solve it and start making that happen. But this rush to solutions centers the egos of designers and other experts. Instead, HCD encourages the belief that good ideas come from everywhere, and thatthe people closest to a problem are in the best position to generate ideas that solve it.The design team organized a local Ideas Workshop, inviting all of their research participants, as well as their own networks of friends and colleagues, to come together and brainstorm. More than 80 people gathered at the local community arts center to respond to a range of How might we questions. These open-ended prompts were meant to spark many ideas, and many kinds of ideas (seehttps://raisingplaces.org/www.raisingplaces.org/the-latest/ideas-lab-in-north-wilkesboro.html).Attendees could write or draw their ideas on paper. They could tell their ideas and stories to design team members, who were stationed all around the room to listen to and document them. Or they could like the ideas of others by adding stickers.Photo caption: How might we poster surrounded by stories and ideas at the North Wilkesboro ideas workshop.Photo credit: Janessa RobinsonThe workshop was successful for two reasons: first, it convened a critical mass of local players. From third-graders to elders, from relative newcomers to longtime community residents, from news media and politicians to teachers and social workers, people discussed the insights and opportunities presented around the room and felt a sense of hope and momentum.Photo caption: Attendees at the ideas workshop, including April Burns (right).Photo credit: Janessa RobinsonAnd second, the ideas were fantastic. More than 200 ideas from all corners of the community were written, drawn, and posted around the room. A scan of dot stickers indicated where the local energy was highest. Among the many ideas chosen for prioritization, the most promising was the concept of a mobile food market.In HCD, we often say things like, go for quantity and more is more when brainstorming, but it takes a certain degree of psychological safety to share your ideas. American cultures dominant norms encourage the notion of one right way of doing things, rather than considering multiple pathways to an outcome. For people who are not used to being listened to by folks in power, it can feel pointless or even risky to share ideas. The barriers are real.Even more acutely, when someone is living with past or present trauma, the very notion of thinking about solutions is practically absurd. But my experience has been that once someone has been listened to, and their living expertise has been truly recognized, they may shift their thinking, at least temporarily, to a state of wondering: What are the ways that different levers in society might be pulled to prevent this from happening again? This mindset shift is powerful.And so, the design team listened to stories. They encouraged not-yet-fully-formed ideas. They built on and added to the ideas that had already been shared. They encouraged people to add their feedback. They also assured attendees that the process would continue, that ideas would move into prototypes and eventually pilots. They sent a message to every attendee that their ideas mattered. And the community responded.Learning Through DoingThe next stage of HCD is prototyping. The goal of a prototype is not to validate its success; rather, it is to learn about which parts of the concept are working, which are not, and most importantly, why. The Raising Places design team launched the first prototype of the mobile food market with two pop-ups: one at Wilkes Towers, an apartment building for elders, and another at the Housing Authority.A design team member rented a van, bought produce from Aldi, and set it up on a folding table. They handed out vouchers so people could buy without spending their own money, and they surveyed customers about what they liked and didnt like.Both prototypes were very well-attended, said Jenn Wages, program director at The Health Foundation. At that point we decided: this is gonna be a thing (J. Wages, personal communication, July 11, 2023).Photo caption: One of the first prototypes of Wilkes Fresh a pop-up produce sale.Photo credit: Courtesy of the Health FoundationThe design team also learned an important lesson at Wilkes Towers. One of the first things we found was that the needs of older adults, especially those in congregate housing, were different from the general population, said Heather Murphy, executive director of The Health Foundation.They were only buying fresh fruits and vegetables that they didnt have to cook in anything other than a microwave because they didnt have access to full kitchens (H. Murphy, personal communication, June 5, 2023). This insight still guides their product assortment today. The following year, The Health Foundation committed to incubate a pilot of what had now been lovingly named Wilkes Fresh.In subsequent years, Wilkes Fresh ventured farther out into the community. And as the piloting continued, so did the lessons. One thing we found when visiting the outer parts of the county is that a lot of people out that way grow their own fruits and veggies . So, theyd only buy the things they werent growing themselves, said Wages (J. Wages, personal communication, July 11, 2023). This was an important reminder for the design team that success wasnt about big sales, but about meeting needs in underserved areas.Piloting means not only learning from each trial run, but also implementing changes to better meet the needs of end users. After Wilkes Fresh had been operational for a couple of years, Murphy noticed something about one of their customers, who used a wheelchair. Rather than shopping at the Wilkes Fresh central locations, this person had his order delivered to his door by staff. Heather decided to get proximate, or dig into this issue, by interviewing the customer. He explained that his wheelchair couldnt make it over the curb where the van parksa simple, yet profound example of the ways our communities are designed for people without disabilities.This customer attended a design workshop to explore ideas for improving Wilkes Fresh. There, he connected with the town manager, and asked him about curb cuts in that location.He affected that change. They were out there within days, to cut the curb. And he is now a champion of the market, said Murphy. (H. Murphy, personal communication, June 5, 2023).A Solution to Multiple ProblemsToday,Wilkes Freshoperates as a full-time mobile market selling locally grown produce in underserved areas of Wilkes County. Its a permanent fixture in the community and is operated by individuals in recovery through its organizational home atWilkes Recovery Revolution.Photo caption: The Wilkes Fresh van is hard to miss.Photo credit: Courtesy of Sarah WebsterWhile the concept was designed originally to meet the needs of low-income children and families, the Wilkes Fresh team has found that it benefits all types of community members. The market accepts SNAP-EBT vouchers, as well as Market Bucks, which the local health department gives to people who have been identified as food insecure. In this way, fresh food is not only physically accessible, but also financially accessible to low-income people across the county.'The design team had visibility and access into pockets of the town that had been harder to engage.Yet the model is also economically sustainable, because people of all incomes can pay full price for beautifully grown, local produce. This choice to make Wilkes Fresh a market, rather than a food pantry, has also had economic benefits, particularly for local farmers, many of whom are older and struggling financially.Wilkes Fresh has seen ripple effects across its customers. Its been major for us. Our residents are now choosing better options. Some weeks I give them Market Bucks, and they go and get the $4 pint of strawberries. Otherwise, they wouldnt spend $4 in the grocery store on that. Theyd use EBT to buy canned foods, said Greta Ferguson. She has even arranged for local teenagers to help residents who are homebound: they take a picture of the price board, go up and take orders, and then bring the residents their groceries. I try to keep it full circle, she added (G. Ferguson, personal communication, June 29, 2023).The Process Is the ProductHCD can lead to a wide variety of concepts taking root. In North Wilkesboro, the design teams discoveries led to many additional interventions being prototyped, piloted, and launched. My personal favorite is elegant in its simplicity: the WTA bus system implemented a reverse route. Now, Burnss trip to the store takes 5 minutes. These wide-ranging investments in programs and infrastructure add up to a community that is more inclusive and accessible to children, low-income people, older adults, people with disabilities, and others.HCD is arguably better suited for rural than urban innovation, precisely because of the momentum it can generate in a smaller place. Rasa Mirza, a design and innovation leader who in 2022 founded the Rural Design Network, believes that the future of design is rural. In these spaces, the web of relationships is woven stronger. So, if you do things like co-design, its easier to get folks together, she said (R. Mirza, personal communication, June 1, 2023).However, there is a flip side: Mirza explained that rural communities tend to have a longer memory: If you are different, you may have found yourself being ostracized your whole life. There will be people who have been systematically disenfranchised, are less likely to co-design events, less comfortable saying that a solution doesnt work for them. This may be true in urban areas, but its compounded in rural ones because the risk of being different is greater (R. Mirza, personal communication, June 1, 2023).Thats where convening a local design team comes in. In North Wilkesboro, the design team had visibility and access into pockets of the town that had been harder to engage. They were able to spend the social capital necessary to bring more marginalized folks into the center, building trust over time. And ultimately, they became the authors and champions of the solutions. Following the project, design team members told us that they were speaking up in public meetings. Some started nonprofits, others ran for public office.I grew to understand, in ways I had not before, how immensely different the life experiences of someone living two blocks away from me can be, said one design team member, reflecting on the project. This level of proximity is necessary if we are to tackle the systemicand yet deeply humanchallenges of our time.Do ageism and ableism still exist in the mindsets and structures of rural Wilkes County? Absolutely, just as they do in every other part of the country. But through the HCD process, ageism and ableism were identified. They inspired interventions that mitigate their effects in the near term. And they were held at bay by a local design team that is better equipped to learn, brainstorm, and prototype their way through the next challenge.Sara Cantor is the co-founder and Executive Director of Greater Good Studio.

Ryan, and Kimberly ShayOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:In this issue ofGenerations Journal, senior gerontologists describe their professional odysseys, mapping a complex landscape of personal, interpersonal, and sociocultural factors in the gerontology field. As the gerontologists age, their professional narratives are interwoven with autobiography. We are a group of emerging scholars who looked to this issue as a map of the field. We drew connections between our experiences and those of the senior scholars and found a common principle of proximity to study and describe aging, including multidisciplinary perspectives, closeness to our communities, and shared empathy across life stagesall of which are essential to gerontology.Key Words:gerontologists, personal, professional, community, empathy, life stages, scholarsEverything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.Toblers First Law of GeographyWhen creating a model simulation that would provide a language for describing urban population growth in Detroit, MI, W.R. Tobler (1970) stipulated a first law of geography, beginning with the assumption that everything is related to everything else. This would seem to mean systems are too complex to be knowable, but he emphasized that large variable sets may allow complex models to be more tractable than simple ones. Discovery, then, is in the description of proximitymapping the nearness of properties and events in time, process, and locationrather than over-simplifying a dynamic system.What can be said of geography is also true of gerontology as a discipline, and of the gerontologists experience. Gerontology is the study of change and stability across the adult lifespan in all personal, interpersonal, and cultural spaces. We can best understand the process of aging by accepting its complexity. The elements of time and space cannot be conveniently carved up because the experience of aging blurs the contingent, culturally constructed, often arbitrary boundaries we draw between them.Personal narratives of aging are told through the connections between events and relationships in our lives, and the links stretch forward over the years to a destined conclusion, often only evident in hindsight. The gerontologist, then, is the cartographer, sketching the aging landscape; and discovery comes from describing the proximity between the personalized episodes and the sociocultural context that are the landscapes terrain. Of course, terrains are not static, and in the lifelong pursuit of mapping their change, the gerontologist becomes a habitant of that aging landscape. The gerontologists autobiography interweaves with their scholarship, and the boundaries are blurred at those crossing points.In this issue ofGenerations Journal, senior gerontologists share their interwoven personalprofessional odysseys that have shaped the field. We are a group of emerging scholars at the start of our careersan assistant professor, post-doctoral fellows, and advanced doctoral studentswho were invited to review their writings. Our expertise is as varied as the senior scholars we are reading: neuroscience, social psychology, anthropology, cognitive development, occupational therapy, and nursing. Throughout our discussion, we have mapped the connections between their writings and our personal experiences to find, despite our differences in discipline and experience, a common principle of proximity to study and describe aging.Proximity to Ideas: A Gerontologist Is Made in the Space Between Theory and ApplicationIf everything is related to everything else in the scholarship of aging, then any expertise is relevant to gerontology. The multidisciplinary nature of gerontology is highlighted in the varied perspectives of the junior and senior scholars in this issue. We share a common experience in approaching aging research from a home discipline other than formal gerontology. A gerontologist is defined via the application of scholarship, and, it seems, not in the specific theories or methods from our training.Perhaps this definition derived from application reflects the complexity of the system we study. The senior scholars outline variable sets ad infinitum, including economics, social policies, personal health, interpersonal relationships, cultural identities, and geographic disparities. Invoking Toblers law, discovery in aging relies upon knowing the proximity of the relationship among variables. Placing variable sets next to one another is not enough; connections between sets must be drawn.Each gerontologist, with their different home specialty, charts only a part of the aging experience, and a map of the whole field relies upon stitching together their different accounts. The gerontologists choice of details for their corner of the map and their ability to link that specialty to myriad other perspectives depends as much upon collegiality among scholars of different disciplines as it does upon training from any one discipline. In other words, proximity todifferentideas about aging helps to make a gerontologist.With this insight, we found it even more curious that so many in our group of early career scholars contend with fears of not belonging in the field. Our origins in gerontology research are best described as circumstantial, including second careers, clinical re-specialization, and coincidental post-doctoral experiences. (A training in early childhood cognitive development did not obviously lead to a post-doctoral fellowship in a laboratory specializing in aging.)The allure of research questions and clinical practice about aging may have beckoned us to gerontology, but close mentors in the field taught us we could stay.In sharing these fears of not belonging, we found a kinship with the senior scholarsNancy Morrow-Howell, who came to gerontology by responding to advocacy for an older population;Marcia Ory, who was encouraged by colleagues at a new professional appointment; andPeter Lichtenberg, who was propelled by experiences of personal loss. Productive and meaningful careers in gerontology do not necessarily begin with that intention from the start of training or even as a first career.The allure of research questions and clinical practice about aging may have beckoned us to gerontology, but close mentors in the field taught us we could stay. From the periphery, it can be difficult to understand exactly what gerontology is. At some point, we each sought out a mentor (often outside our immediate training environment) to learn definitions of gerontology and to validate our roles in it.Lichtenberg alerts us that specialized training is needed for gerontologists and shares the concern that fewer professionals are seeking it. Looking back upon the recent years of our careers, we noted that we had all received specialized training from other gerontologists, in many ways delivered informally through research or clinical mentorship. Without that access to gerontologists at these pivotal moments, we would not now be part of the cadre Lichtenberg describes. Upon our collective reflections, this principle of proximity to different ideas about aging seems to be essential for not only the practice of gerontology but also the training of the gerontologist.Proximity of Experience: What Is Lacked in Years, A Gerontologist Makes Up for in EmpathyEven with training, there remains the somewhat harsh reality that most active gerontologists have no first-hand experience of being old. We all feltAndy Achenbaums fathers censure, What the f--- do you know about old age? as well as the reassurance from Lichtenberg that empathy and experiences at any life stage, even when not backed by the standard of time, help us to cross the invisible boundaries between younger and older adults.Several in our group of emerging scholars hold a lifespan perspective in our work that reinforces the value of experience at any life stage to supply empathy for the study of aging. This perspective is shared with the senior scholars and, in our view, relates to ideas of productive aging (Butler & Gleason, 1985). In this issue, several senior scholars point to aspects of productive aging as a new model of the time that was a tidal force directing the course of their careers. Although the motivations, skills, and interests for adults to be societally productive change over the life course, asLena Borellnotes, the constant needs for inclusion, participation, and meaning runs through life as a strong theme.There is a universal human experience that qualifies a younger gerontologist similarly to an older one. This is not to minimize the fact that ageism and exclusionary social structures, which initially inspired the productive aging model, are not yet fully dismantled. Considering a lifespan perspective may help to address these biases by reframing aging as a cumulative and progressive experience across all adult years. Or, in Achenbaums eloquent phrasing, manifold faces of age and many pathways to advancing in years . All nonetheless must prepare for and face up to deaths inevitability.The lifespan perspective is only useful, though, if framed as deficit and gain in aging. Addressing widespread concerns over declining health and premature mortality has been an obvious way to communicate the value of our work to society. This became a constant undercurrent in gerontology, which pulls research and social services to address the deficits in aging. Morrow-Howell notes that the overexposure to problems, tough situations, poor quality of life we gain socially and professionally immerses us in the age as deficit reality. The clinician and nurse in our group spoke to this having a monumental emphasis in their personal experience of gerontology simply due to facing daily the needs of patients in their care.We can compensate by including older voices in research, clinical translation, and policymaking as an imperative of modern gerontology.While addressing deficits is warranted, the pull of this undercurrent slows discovery without the counterforce of gains, engagement, and insights gifted with age. Age as deficit is a map of only the hazardous terrains, and it ignores the vistas. A gerontologist charting the aging experience thoroughly will be fascinated by the paradoxical proximity of deficit and gain that unfurls across the lifespan and that, amid these changes, there is the constant need for meaning in life.This lifespan perspective is projected in the autobiographical accounts of the senior scholars as they view their own process of aging through gerontology scholarship. Just as Peter Greenaway (1979) described a map telling where youve been, where you are, and where youre goingin a sense, its three tenses in one, we gerontologists are simultaneously in the present, and looking forward and backward in time. There is a vulnerability in aging while studying aging that we relate to as emerging scholars, even when we have more time ahead of us than not. For either good or ill, we are aware of our own aging and the importance of present decisions to our older selves awaiting us decades from now. The same applies to our scholarship as we try to read the currents in the field to find direction and to decide which research questions and clinical practices might have the most significant societal value (also likely delayed by decades, given the speed of translating research to practice).For all the value we can provide as gerontologists, despite our youth, we still cannot confidently tell Achenbaums father that we know todays older adult experience. If the first-hand experience of old age qualifies a gerontologist, we will be perennially disadvantaged because the odds are there will always be someone older than us. We can compensate by including older voices in research, clinical translation, and policymaking as an imperative of modern gerontology. Community-partnered research leverages older adults personal experiences to improve the quality and impact of scholarship. Evermore important are the experiences of historically excluded and marginalized groups, which have been left off the map.If we learn how to draw boundaries and connections from our academic training, then we borrow the palette to color our maps from our closest community partners. The shaded nuance and depth of agingthe humaneness in our scholarshipcomes from listening to older adults describe their concerns, triumphs, and aspirations. Here, we found another application of the proximity principle to include our communities, where the quality of scholarship entwines with the quality of our personal relationships.Kyriakos Markidesspeaks of his productive career addressing diversity issues in aging, and we can see how community connection created a type of dialect in his scholarship.We anticipate that as qualitative and mixed methods study designs become more prominent tools in the future, they will center the diverse experiences of older adults in the research process and science communication, especially when it comes to intersectional identities. Gerontology research teams are expanding to include multidisciplinary scholars and community partners that are ideally situated to guide us through the aging landscape.Proximity in Process: The Continuity of Scholarship Across Generations of GerontologistsIdeas take time to form and even longer to take effect. This is especially true in gerontology, as new cohorts are born only every few decades, and so the process of learning about aging unfolds across generations of gerontologists. The benefit of todays scholarship will become evident years from now in the lives and work of emerging scholars and manifest in the infrastructure supporting older adults. Each gerontologist changes the aging landscape by the very act of exploration, and we traced a cause-and-effect chain made in the links between our careers and the work of the senior scholars nearest to us.The next generation of gerontologists is not necessarily tackling new issues in aging. In many cases, we are seeing through the evolution of self-efficacy, health, and well-being for older adults, similar themes to what the senior scholars in this issue have been developing. In their writings, these scholars identify significant themes of their work in retrospect, but what would they have predicted for themselves and the field at the start of their careers? Here, we dabble in some prognostication for the next 30 years of gerontology research.We anticipate that the lifespan perspective on aging will be an organizing principle for the field. The past few decades of work have characterized the general experiences of the older adult in late life, their care needs, and their contributions in the workplace and community. Because no singular age denotes old age, characterizing the onset and progression of change (deficit and gain) is the next stage of understanding and, in turn, promoting the welfare of older adults as they themselves defined it. This way, we can begin to separate the actual limits in human functioning from the artificial limits that Morrow-Howell highlights in her writing. Artificial limits plague us at any age, in our scholarship as much as in personal life. These authors inspire us to challenge ourselves to disregard the artificial limits that we and others impose.We are propelled by a desire to promote health and well-being into late life, to maintain self-efficacy for older adults, and to combat ageism.This is a convenient framework to consider the contextual factors that modify individual experiences of aging. The articles in this issue highlight social, cultural, economic, and mental health contexts, and we anticipate subsequent decades of research will expand to consider the environment, as well as early life factors, and the interactions among them. The majority of gerontology research has been conducted in Western cultures with samples of limited diversity. This has been a productive start but is insufficient for understanding the full complexity of individualized aging; we have only just begun detailing this part of the terrain.We hear Markidess call to incorporate a social context into our understanding of aging and the means to improve the lives of older adults. The study of individual contextual factors is as essential for identifying resiliency in aging as it is for tailored interventions to reduce health disparities in late life. The path forward for this is not entirely charted, as many existing methods and study designs were not intentionally made for this purpose. There are new places open for the gerontologist specializing in method development, science communication in a time of radical mistrust of intellectualism, or student training to improve representation in our professions to better reflect the diversity of our communities.At the start of our careers, we are propelled by a desire to promote health and well-being into late life, to maintain self-efficacy for older adults, and to combat ageism. For the researchers the meaning is there in the open every day, says Borell, and we are motivated to improve the aging experience for our families and ourselves. But our ambition alone is not enough. We need advocates in education and research funding to support this work. More than ever, gerontology will become a team-science model to cover the breadth of the skills required to implement a study, build meaningful relationships in our communities, and communicate the importance of the work across social sectors.Ory provides a wonderful history of the field that was the context for her personal odyssey at a time when the National Institute on Aging was established and there was heightened advocacy to reframe the aging experience. We now have a different context for our work: We have never known a time without the National Institute on Aging, and their research funding priorities have shaped the field to exaggerate aging-as-deficit and health as a principal definition of successful aging.The work has been nonetheless successful, leading to increased longevity and decreased dementia rates in most industrialized countries (World Health Organization, 2022). Thus, in the next 30 years, we will have more older adults experiencing non-catastrophic decline than ever before. We are living today in the midst of a substantial shift in the aging landscape that will force evolution in research priorities and practice to support an active, engaged older generation for longer.Charting a Course for a New ExpeditionThis is the vantage point from which we embark on our careers. We turn to existing maps of the field to plan our course. In this issue, senior scholars sketch the terrains of their careers with clean lines that can only be made in retrospect. They have given us maps without all the false starts, wrong turns, and dead ends of a map made in real time. There remain areas of study wholly uncharted and those awaiting new details of the perpetually shifting landscape. We now pick up the search where they leave off. What discoveries and pitfalls await us?This brings to mind a scene of the British sitcom from the late 1980s,Blackadder II(Fletcher, 1986) upon planning for a voyage: The foremost cartographers of the land have prepared this for you; its a map of the area that youll be traversing. Blackadder opens the map to see it is blank.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2023Life-Course Reflections on a Career in AgingBy Peter A. LichtenbergOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:This article integrates my professional journey of practice, research, and administration with a reflection on how the field of gerontology has changed across 35 years and how the healthcare industry responded to the growing numbers of older adults. Paradoxically, while the field of gerontology has become more multidisciplinary and integrative, the number of specialists in gerontology across all health fields has declined or remained at very low levels. Research on aging, however, continues to grow. The lessons of working with older adults have long been a part of my personal journey; a gift to me and othersKey Words:Gerontology, professional practice, psychology and agingThe field of gerontology, the locations in which I could practice geropsychology, and the recognition of the importance of gerontology have changed considerably since I began my career 35 years ago. Yet, the older people I interview for my research and for whom I perform neurocognitive assessments in my clinical work have not changed much at all. Clinical settings were very different more than three decades ago and served older adults with widely varied physical and cognitive issues. Progress, and, paradoxically, reversals have been manifested in the fields of gerontology and societal practices across my career.In the early years of the psychology-of-aging field, a conceptual and practical divide existed between clinicians working on problems related to aging and those who worked on understanding normal aging. These were viewed as non-overlapping populations. Although my work clearly involved clinical problems related to aging, I pushed for connections between normal aging and some age-related disorders.Attending sessions and having conversations with colleagues at the Gerontological Society of America enabled me to integrate normal and pathological aging work. It was only slowly that the field began to recognize that cognitive aging and dementia, for example, existed on a continuum and that disease processes began neurologically well before there were even early symptoms. Thus, longitudinal studies of memory and aging held some of the greatest data for understanding early Alzheimers disease.Perhaps the most influential study in this regard was the Memory and Aging Project (1979present) led by Dr. Martha Storandt, a psychologist and cognitive aging scholar, which ran parallel to the Washington University Alzheimers disease study led by Dr. Leonard Berg, a neurologist and medical scientist. The two studies worked collaboratively, in that as years went by, many Memory and Aging Project participants experienced dementia, and it was instructive to go back to the cognitive aging data and identify the earliest measurable decline. Thus, there were reliable cognitive changes years before dementia symptoms became apparent. This study of early markers of decline has accelerated as the measurement of brain structure, functioning, and biomarkers has expanded. The field has become increasingly more integrated, with multiple disciplines working together at multiple levels of analysis (environment, biomarkers, social determinants, genetics, etc.).Profits Over PatientsA troubling disjunction is emerging in gerontology. It has been a growth field since well before the day I entered it, but gerontological care as a specialized practice has been greatly diminished, even as the numbers of older people grow. I worked primarily as a clinician and researcher for the first 14 years of my career, and in award-winning programs for the care of older seriously mentally ill adults and older adults in acute medical rehabilitation.The gerontological field has become increasingly more integrated; with multiple disciplines working together at multiple levels of analysis.From 1986 until 1991 I was the geriatric psychology director for services to 180 older adults with serious mental illness (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and comorbid dementia with severe behavioral disturbances) in what was then a Medicare-licensed intermediate care facility at Western State Hospital in Staunton, VA. Older adults in intermediate care facilities were not in need of more intensive skilled care and were more independent, performing their own activities of daily living, but due to a mental disorder or disability they could not live independently. These people were covered by Medicaid insurance.In what became a trend across the country, the state hospital system sought to decrease its costs by discharging these older patients to group homes, other assisted living residences, or in some cases to skilled nursing facilities. Not content to presume these policies and practices worked to everyones benefit, my team and I followed up on each discharged patient who went to an assisted living or group home situation. It was troubling to watch the older patients regress, and to see the lower quality facilities to which they were discharged. I sought opportunities to confront these problems.In 1991 I became the geriatric neuropsychologist at the Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan in Detroit. This was more of a consultation service, and it was exciting also to be able to participate in rounds with the physiatrist, observe patients in the occupational therapy (OT) or physical therapy (PT) gym, and give feedback to families. I also had the opportunity to lead a training program for pre- and post-doctoral trainees, and to perform more research.Being on the campus of Wayne State University also meant I was involved with the Institute of Gerontology there. After 8 years this geriatric service line was disbanded. These service centers were not profitable or efficient enough to last; both were closed despite high volumes of older patients. Such changes echoed an ongoing societal challenge, perhaps even a reversal, in promoting the well-being of older adults.The loss of geriatric expertise in medical rehabilitation can lead to lost expertise concerning frailty, dementia, delirium and depression, and substance use disorders. Specialists in geriatric medicine have declined significantly, as have training programs for such specialists.The paradox is that as the volume of older adults increased dramatically, the specialists to care for them declined precipitously. Funding for training programs dried up, and geriatric practices, usually dependent upon Medicare reimbursements, were not financially viable. Recognizing that specialty practice in gerontology and geriatrics was not going to rebound, in 2008 the Institute of Medicine put out a book called Re-Tooling for an Aging America in which they called for the immediate training of all health professionals in some geriatric content.The Work Remains Incredibly FulfillingThe problems and opportunities for an aging society remain, and that is why my years dedicated to leadership serving as administrator, researcher, and limited clinician have been so satisfying. Research to better understand and intervene on problems related to aging remains a high priority in the federal research portfolio.For me, the opportunity to lead the Wayne State Institute of Gerontology proved to be the most satisfying years in my career. As a director, I had the opportunity to hire outstanding faculty members and watch their interdisciplinary research programs grow, establish training programs for the next generation of gerontology scholars, and create a community engagement effort that connects the Institute to the Detroit community.Gerontological care as a specialized practice has been greatly diminished, even as the numbers of older people grow.Being outside of academic medicine opened greater opportunities for leadership, and a growth in my own research program. For 26 years I have co-directed the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research, a program to mentor scientists from diverse backgrounds and to connect with the community around research in new and meaningful ways.The opportunities to further the careers of so many wonderful colleagues are so meaningful to me. The extraordinary experience of working closely with the University of Michigan directors and leaders in the study of older Black adults, Drs. James Jackson and Robert Taylor, helped me improve as a mentor, and as a scientist.When the Professional Becomes PersonalThe people and lifetimes we study can hit home quickly; they are not just out there in the field. When I was 25 years old, my wife of 3 years died suddenly and unexpectedly. It was tragic and so off time. I experienced grief in the way 25-year-olds do when they lose the person most precious to them. I also crossed the invisible boundaries between younger and older adults; I was attuned to loss, and comfortable talking and hearing about it.It took many years, but I found incredible joy in a new relationship and a new marriage. After 20 years together and 15 years of marriage that brought us two children, my wife and colleague, Dr. Susan MacNeill, died of metastatic breast cancer; a case of mammogram failure to detect the mass at its early stage. In 2017 I wrote a paper for a special issue of The Gerontologist titled Grief and Healing in Young and Middle Age: A Widowers Journey. My career and my opportunities to help othersolder adults I work with and students and colleagueshave played a big part of my healing.So, too, has the role I have played with many friends and family members as a gerontologist. I was my parents choice for their power of attorney and when it came to their final days both my mother and father died peacefully with few days of total disability and no pain.Two of my best friends from college lost their spouses when they were in their early 60s, and I was able to be a trusted confidant as they grieved. Integrating my professional journey into my personal life for the benefit of friends and family and to help me understand my own journey has been a most meaningful career gift.Peter A.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2023In Search of the Good LifeBy Lena BorellOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:As gerontologists we know the nature of aging and later life differ widely, and many inequalities exist. The focus of this article is on how the good life in retirement is envisioned across settings. Recently, differences in cultural views on retirement age between two European countries caught my eye. When Frances President Emmanuel Macron raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, the French protested. At the same time, in Sweden we learned that 70 can be seen as the new 50, and the retirement age is 69. The article discusses hopes and wishes we hold as older persons about what retirement should mean.Key Words:retirement, meaning, participation, good life, protests, France, SwedenTravailler pour vivre et non vivre pour travailler[Work to live not live to work], proclaimed the banners of protesters massing in the streets of Paris against President Emmanuel Macron raising the retirement age from 62 to 64. Their words are understandable but unfamiliar. Perhaps especially so to this Swedish-born researcher who recently mandatorily retired at age 67 in accord with national policy.We have long known that aging and later life do not occur equally; diversities and inequalities exist between countries, social classes, genders, ethnicities, and communities, within families, and across eras of individual lifetimes. The nature and salience of these differences is coming into sharper focus as the field of gerontology continues to develop. Reflecting on this topic as a senior scholar, I see echoes of those dimensions surfacing across my career, which spans much of the field's development and my own lifes journey.I was reminded of the differences by those French demonstrations against President Macron's proposal to raise the pension age. His plan was to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 in response to burdens from declining economic conditions and increasing numbers of older adults. Two years is not a very long time, so what were the French strikes and demonstrations all about? I had to learn more. I was puzzled, and it was ironic considering my retirement was mandated as a national policy long defined as being for the larger social good, despite the fact that I was actively engaged in research and in developing programs to promote later life as a socially and personally meaningful and valued time.Diverse Social Contracts for the Good LifeThe French anger concerned more than the measure of two chronological years. The question at stake in France was, should the collective social contract for French citizens define them as workers serving the interests of industry and economy, or as persons entitled to a good life in exchange for the reasonable service they had provided to the country? Or, as voiced on another protest banner, La retraite avant laethrite[Retirement before arthritis] (https://youtu.be/Q0QmUXCMGbk).In France this historic discourse in relation to aging and the period of later life suggests thatla bonne vie(the good life) is expected to happen when one leaves work to become a pensioner and is supported by a guaranteed pension. It embodies the ideal that after retirement from work at age 62 the French look forward to living the good life. The good life is envisioned as a time when physical and cognitive health is still relatively sound and children no longer are dependent upon their parents, so retirees can enjoy family, friends, and activities. Retirement to the French seems to mean feeling free from work demands and finding time to enjoy life, while not occupied by work and family responsibilities. The discourse on work and a post-work life of leisure in retirement is obviously not the same everywhere, not even within Europe.Swedish Slogans Claim the Right to Work After 67Contrasts in the focus of debates about retirement age highlight a striking difference between France and Sweden. In Sweden there is an ongoing discussion on aging that argues 70 now can be considered to be the new 50. Older Swedish people today wish to keep working after retirement at age 67, but the right to do so is not taken for granted.Under certain conditions, such as a labor shortage, one may be given the opportunity to continue working after age 67. Still, this is not an option for all Swedes who would like to continue working. Longitudinal studies in gerontology (Skoog & Sterner, 2022; Wetterberg et al., 2022) across 30 years show that it is common in Sweden for todays 70-year-olds to have the same physical and intellectual capacity as 50-year-olds had 30 years ago. The older population in Sweden is described as healthier than ever before.It is interesting to think about and try to understand the cultural differences in Europe, exemplified here between France and Sweden. In France, the focus is on maintaining the retirement age (62) to live the good life far from work, while in Sweden the focus is on older people who want to have the right to continue working after age 67. The differences between cultures challenge the discourse on aging and gerontology research.The Good Life Is About Participation and MeaningThe two perspectives on retirement that emerge when we compare France and Sweden seem at first glance to be completely different. But when we try to understand, similarities emerge: there are shared aspects about what is of importance in aging and what retirement should mean to the older person. Discussions in the two countries are both related to being involved, participating, and experiencing meaning in daily life. This could be in leisure activities or work, but the shared focus is on taking an active part, being engaged in a life that is still vibrant. It is about participation and meaning and having the right to a choiceto take part in play or in work. (For some researchers work always include play.)Older people are not all that different from younger people in terms of needs and hopes for a good life.When we compare the two countries, we find similarities between the French people wanting their good life before arthritis, and the Swedish people who want to continue working after age 67 because work is the good life for them. The overarching idea is the importance of choice, whether to participate in either work or in leisure, and thus find meaning in everyday life.Our Ageist View of the Good LifeSurprisingly widespread in popular culture and in international gerontological research are ideas that you, as an older person, are inclined to spend the remainder of your life reflecting on your past life and not actively participating in activities that appeal to younger people.As an older person you are expected to look back on the life that has passed, as opposed to living life in its full sense in the here and now. This approach does not fit in France today, nor in Sweden. Comparing the conditions for retirement in France and in Sweden shows that a new view, based in research of what it is to be an older person today, needs to be launched. Participation for older people means to find meaning in everyday living, and the right to have a choice to work or not to work.Today, at age 70, in looking back, it seems to me that it takes extensive life experience to understand that older people are not all that different from younger people in terms of needs and hopes for a good life, and the needs for inclusion, participation, and meaning run through life as strong themes. We need to question and interrogate the assumed truths about what the good life is as an older person and talk more about how we imagine the good life for future generations.Participation and Meaning in ResearchThe concepts of participation and meaning are two themes that run through my professional life as a researcher, mentor, and teacher. Participation often becomes a methodological approach to learning, building upon collaboration between, for example, carers and researchers. One of my goals has been to conduct research and change practice in nursing homes for people who have dementia.To change practice, care staff participation is of pivotal importance. The care staff needs to point to and define the challenges and identify the best solutions to make improvements in care. These research approaches and ideas for creating new knowledge can make a real impact. This approach was implemented in a nursing home in Stockholm for 200 people who had dementia, calledThe Reality Lab.The Reality Lab was set up with the goal to better connect research and care in practice, and to create a site for learning, education, and innovation for staff and students. By inviting staff to take part in research, we also could more easily address meaning (the lived experience) in our research, beyond taken-for-granted behavior, routines, and care processes (Mondaca, 2020). For the researchers involved, this approach to conducting research is intended for publication and at the same time is meant to have a positive impact on developments in practice.For researchers the meaning is there in the open, every day. And it takes us back to the idea that older people are not different from younger people in terms of needs and hopes for a good life in old age.Lena Borell, OTR, PhD, is a professor emeritus of Occupational Therapy in the department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.Photo caption: People demonstrate against the retirement age increase in France, March 28, 2023.Photo credit: Shutterstock/Kamila KoziolReferencesDaman Official.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2023Still WritingNot Done Aging YetBy W. Andrew AchenbaumOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:How people talk about aging depends in part upon the ages of the conversationalists. I relied in my 20s on materials in gerontology collections. My own loving and suffering mid-career generated identification and empathy for older Americans. Only in late life have I more fully appreciated the joys and fears of soul friendsdiverse elders of the tribe who illuminate distinctive journeys of living into death.Keywords:longitudinal perspectives, old age, loving, sufferingDad turned stone-faced when I told him that my doctoral thesis would chronicle old age in the United States from 1790 to the 1970s. (Years before, when I declared a desire to become a professor, not the lawyer or doctor he had wanted me to be, Dad muttered, A school teacher.) He swore contemptuously this time: What the f--- do you know about old age? My father raised a good question, but it was one that I had the sense to leave unanswered. Dad died suddenly, just before my first childs birth and the publication of my bookOld Age in the New Land(Achenbaum, 1978).In mid-career I happily spent several years on the Generations Editorial Advisory board. I co-authored an issue on the changing perceptions of aging and the aged (Schenk & Achenbaum, 1994) and wrote occasional policy critiques (Achenbaum & Carr, 2014). Interjecting personal beliefs into professional writing, I joined other American Society on Aging (ASA) members in blazing critical gerontology as a counter-narrative to quantifiable, evidence-based research (Cole et al., 1993). Transitions about selected facets of my aging self can be documented in successive articles I wrote inGenerations.Writing in Generations About Aspects of My Second Half of LifeMy first essay, Reflections on Being Fifty, focused onThe Baby Boom at Midlife and Beyond:\"At fifty, everyone has the face he deserves I am still wrestling with taking off masks I learned so well to wear Of course the stuff that counts lies beneath the facial surface. Try as I might, I still have not achieved an integration of thoughts, feelings and actions that have eluded me most of my adulthood.\" (Achenbaum, 1998)I was struggling ambivalently to respond to my fathers profanely provocative question. I had learned, by the time I was 50, some things about late life. I had only envisioned superficial complexities, however. Decades of research and teaching rarely captured what fed my awakening soul, so I decided to seek out Baby Boomers and individuals in the Greatest Generation whose paths diverged from mine.While exploring what it means to grow older, disconnects in peoples stories redefined spaces between thoughts and gaps in feelings. I underestimated, for instance, how greatly chronic illnesses and declining capacities could affect older persons self-perceptions and social engagement. I seemed oblivious to kin who died unexpectedly in their prime until I better ascertained the transitory fragility of life through personal experiences of suffering.Chronically Me records how I felt:\"My body once had served me well with little care or thought for maintenance on my part. Now it was beginning to let me down Chronic illness gave me a taste of my own mortality that I had not viscerally experienced before I became tired and lethargic withdrew from friends [and] started to miss appointments, to forget names and citations.\" (Achenbaum, 2006)Mental, social, and spiritual decline were sapping energy and curbing enthusiasm in my prime.Nevertheless, in the third quarter of life, I was savoring some of the joys of living in liminal moments bracketed by loving and suffering (Pifer & Bronte, 1986). When my granddaughter Tabitha was born, I was a relative late bloomer at age 64. Some friends of mine had become first-time grandfathers before age 40. More than 90% of women and men roughly my age already were repositioning themselves in multigenerational familieshalf had at least one adult grandchild interacting with them better than they had with their offspring.At that time, I recounted, Minutes after the delivery I heard my son-in-law Erik say to my daughter Emily, We really have to name this childnow!... I feared making a false step or sarcastic comment. I wanted to see what happened next (Achenbaum, 2011).Grandfathers, I slowly learned, should remain on the sidelines, watching developments in silence.Advising undergraduates and mentoring doctoral students might have prepared me for becoming a grandfather. I was accustomed to offering advice primarily to prevent disastrous outcomes. Confused, distressed younger people, I insisted, could take or leave my counsel as they deemed appropriate. Transferring skills from an academic to a kinship setting, I had to figure out on my own when and how to step aside. Grandfathers, I slowly learned, should remain on the sidelines, watching developments in silence.Critically Exploring Agings Personal Frontiers and Respecting Collective BordersNew opportunities arose when I was in my mid-60s, which triggered memories of earlier struggles and mistakes, and tested my expertise as a (self/societal) critical gerontologist. Clearly perceiving myself as having been transformed by loving and suffering, I struggled with fresh challenges:\"I am [not quite] semi-retired from an academic career to which I devoted enormous time and energy On a personal note, I remarried [and then] a dark face of aging appeared. My bride was diagnosed with cancer nine weeks after the wedding [making] me an uncomfortable caregiver.\" (Achenbaum, 2012)Through these unwelcome rites of passageretirement took 7 years, while caregiving othersI often felt discouraged but never excessively burdened.Personal opinions about a disarticulated political culture turned overtly partisan in a special issue ofGenerationsthat I co-edited called, The Summer of Love, the Baby Boomers, and Their Arc of Aging. I fortunately was savvy enough to let co-authors, far more disparate in attitudes and experiences than media pundits usually portray, to illustrate points of divergence and converging moments as this generation matured and aged (Achenbaum, 2017). ASA member Paul Kleyman illuminated media hype, and Robert Applebaum estimated Baby Boomers financial readiness for retirement. Rick Moody limned our generations dramatic shift from great expectations to a crisis of meaning:\"The postwar period of baby boomer childhood and adolescence seemed to embody a story of progress, an expectation that the future would be better, that each generation would live better than those before . But this collective story about hope and progress has its dark side For many of them, it looks like Golden Pond may be drying up What about baby boomers as they confront later life? Are they disillusioned? ... Despite happy talk about aging . [they deflect] facts of aging, sickness, and death.\" (Moody, 2017)My successive contributions toGenerations, compiled altogether, evoked contrapuntal themes of growth and recapitulation, setbacks and breakthroughs. As May Sarton (1995) observed, it is quite easy to wither into old age, and hard to grow into it. Still writing, my longing and capacity for self-reflection continues relentlessly. Accordingly, I now interject three recent additional insights, which toggle between age-irrelevant personal knowledge and age-based societal disparities:Loving and sufferingin agingrequire strength, resilience, and courage.Aging can generatea spiritual questthat prioritizes hopes and wrestles with fears.Not everyone fulfills the first two propositions, but all of uslive into death.No cross-cultural comparative analyses validate these complementary propositions. Instead, they attest to an ongoing quest to highlight variegated dimensions of advancing years.Loving and Suffering in AgingI strive with mixed success to sustain a self-awareness that embodies loving and suffering in late life. I savor conversations with my wife and daughters; I seek solitude gazing at sunsets, when I am not cheating in card games with my grandchildren or dining with friends. These pleasures somewhat compensate for lossescognitive impairment, ageist rebukes, giving up control, and years-long haphazard caregiving (Achenbaum, 2021).Prosaic iterations and serendipitous intrusions frame my loving and suffering, often proving as transformative as unexpected epiphanies and debilitating crises. They refract choices and redirect decisions independent of my overlapping adherence to cultural norms and transactions. Shadowy revelations, emotional pain, and euphoric moments meanwhile inwardly interact in disturbingly random motion all the time. I suffer wounds when unmasking my self, many never to be fully healed by a transcendent, immanent, immortal love encased and enculturated in diurnal tasks. Blessed with hard-earned entitlements, I nevertheless cannot singlehandedly perfect a holistic integrity that embodies my being.I strive with mixed success to sustain a self-awareness that embodies loving and suffering in late life.I am a White male Baby Boomer whose Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish ancestors came to the United States over a span of 340 years. (This background probably influenced my working as an historian and gerontologist, a calling which landed me, sequentially in Athens, Fort Sill, Ann Arbor [in two stints], Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and Houston.) My career, like most peoples, was punctuated by ups and downs. I happily (though admitting residual misgivings) pass the baton to younger and older professionals.What, in ill thoughts again? declaimed Shakespeare inKing Lear(1606). Men must endure their going hence, even as their coming hither. Ripeness is all.Questions tougher (putatively more poignant than the one that Dad profaned a half-century ago) accompany twists and turns in my gero-psychological ripening. Did extra years engender the potential for meaning-filled strength, one that anchors core values such as compassion and respect for the dignity of others? Conversely, can longevity in an age-phobic culture exacerbate egotistical fears of worthlessness and abandonment?What animates hopes for flourishing, amid ceaseless adaptations to frailty and loss of intimate partners? Years of autonomy do not epigenetically segue the surrender of control over our destinies and demise.Facing advancing age with strength, resilience, and courage ideally nurtures wisdom. But where does such wisdom lie? Extracting it from scholarly sages, scientific punditry, or savvy soundbites helps, but wisdoms wellsprings are found within my conscious, spiritual, soulful beingall contingently present as I stumble on uncharted, often forbidding, pathways.Aging Often Sparks a Conscious, Spiritual, and Soulful QuestBreakthroughs in loving and setbacks on pilgrims ways, I am increasingly aware, instigate transformative developments toward authentic individuationwhether they be healthful or irrational, ecstatic or frustrating. Experiential awakenings, which burst forth often serendipitously (Achenbaum, in press), represent shards of knowledge amid clusters of unknowing. Both phenomena emit ironies, paradoxes, contingencies, and lacunae.One continuity prevails, however, over time and across space: The synergistic interplay of conscious, spiritual, and soulful aging integrates self-caring that energizes caregiving gifts. I suspect but cannot document how many elders around the globe want to connect with a healer, a life-sustaining, loving Creator (however imagined, named, and honored by sojourners).Conscious aging, for me, renews intentionally self-reflective growth through an open-ended ripening of heart and mind. Dualistic thinking and straightjacketed feelings give way to tolerating dubiety and ambiguity, to forgiving ones mistakes and misjudgments, and to shedding attachments and addictive behaviors. Conscious aging accepts limitations and flaws that for much of my life manifested itself in clinging to self-determinedly coveting more.Spiritual aging conjoins conscious roots and potentially enthuses soulful branches as seekers remember joys and to derive consolation in tragedy. Spiritual yearnings per se cannot hide wounds, discard resentments, or unmask invidious envy of kin, friends, and strangers. This raises questions unimagined earlier in life, however. Does a Creative Source of Being need me as much as I thirst for communion to receive grace-filled, overflowing love? Embarked in soulful aging, I strive consciously and stagger spiritually for friendship with a boundless, ineffable Ultimate Reality.Conscious aging, for me, renews intentionally self-reflective growth through an open-ended ripening of heart and mind.Yet doubts remain about being bounded by loving and suffering. Despite having come this far in my spiritual journey, I palpably dread being forgotten or rendered obsolescent. What if seeking love culminates not in union, but dissolves into dreaded and dreadful nothingness? What if divine love is a crucible that, by melting layers of my cherished self, tempts me to detest what led me all along to desire God? And herein lies the hoped-for, albeit paradoxical gift of soulful aging: I prepare for dying into death, with all its uncertainties, by centering my mind and anchoring my heart in the embrace of a mystical Being. Beyond my mortal comprehension, a standing invitation to love always preexisted my returning to dust.Death Is a CertaintyThere are manifold faces of age and many pathways to advancing in years, which elders here and abroad experience as they grow older in diverse ways. Some of us cannot overcome acute despair and chronic suffering. Loves vulnerability does not pierce those who never have felt beloved. Conscious, spiritual, and soulful aging neither prevents physical insults nor mitigates cognitive decline. Elders who neither look nor act like me have distinctive viewpoints and unique experiences. All nonetheless must prepare for and face up to deaths inevitability.Scientists and philosophers for millennia have been debating variously contested perspectives on death and interpreting manifold fears about dying. Like Seneca who once asserted that senectus morbidus est (old age is a disease), some experts and emerging professionals investigate and measure finitudes pathological origins.Aristotles emphasis on black humors foreshadowed researchers who quantify physiological causes of passing or detect genes producing free radicals that sever tenuous albeit dynamic bonds between loving and suffering.I doubt that anti-aging interventions prolong life well beyond current lifespan limits.\"Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimers and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infections.\" (Nuland, 1993, pg. 78).Myriad imponderables complicate living with fortitude and dying into finitude. Only 10 states and the District of Columbia permit medical aid in dying. Drugs and opioids administered to hospice patients often appear to be murky transactions, as do causes of sudden death in nursing homes and assisted-living centers. Does a spike in suicides among older Americans during the coronavirus pandemic suggest that feelings of loneliness, isolation, and abandonment should enter the etiology? Can pathologists and ethicists here and abroad create a uniform, standard definition of brain death after cardiac arrest or a massive stroke that allows for validating individuals accounts that recall experiences of bright lights in tunnels?Reflections at the bedside and before funerals, moreover, vary among those who mourn loved ones passing. Is the accidental death of a child or youth more grievous than the demise of an elder who has endured an incurable disease or decades-long diminishment? Some bereaved cremate their dead; others forbid the practice. And why is it that we deny anxiety about the hereafter, or blandly sentimentalize tradition-based beliefs concerning life-after-death? Its not yet for me to say, particularly as I must acknowledge doubts in the face of mystery.Still Writing a Bit MoreI Am Not Dead Yet!What the f--- do you know about old age? erupted Dad. Forty-five years ago, I wrote that many of the ageds present resources, problems, and opportunities, in fact, are distinctive products of the longstanding, complex, and cumulative interplay of historical events and personalities as well as ideational factors and structural forces (Achenbaum, 1978/2019). To this response, I still cannot compellingly encapsulate diverse demographics nor probe comparative societal intersectionalitythough I grasp multiple routes toward a forever elusive completion of being that defy nomothetic prescriptions or evidence-based inquiries (Goldman et al., 2022). Within limits to what I can write, loving and suffering change contexts with age.First, elders of the tribe vary in the degree to which they display underappreciated resources and support to grapple with mounting chronic ailments, mental impairment, as well as psychological decrements and socioeconomic disengagements that persist in an ageist culture. Second, regardless of religious affiliations or secular constraints, older people mostly can opt to lean into spiritual quests, with convoys of friends to balance loving and suffering.It is not for me to write more until I further encounter the Fourth Ages unfathomable joys and endure unexpected problems that lie ahead. I have learned, in facing finitude, that love is universal and abundant. It is not immutable, however.Any homecoming with a divine spark probably will be fraught with ambiguity, mystery, and surprises. Loving and suffering animate advancing years. They are freely given, not a communal state to be earned. Dying since birth, presently I await death in patience and silence, whatever its cause, shape, or timing. So I surely will keep meditating and writing for Generations should I be granted extra, healthful years.W.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2023Perspectives of a Social Gerontologist: Aging with the FieldBy Marcia G. OryOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:A personal reflection by noted social gerontologist, Marcia G. Ory, who provides insights on the field of gerontology and her nearly 50-year career trajectory at the intersection of aging and public health. She discusses her personal and professional journey, with callouts to mentors. Her review emphasizes stabilities and changes in the study of healthy aging, and the lifelong relevance of core principles of aging. This reflection applauds social gerontologists who have led the charge to reimagine aging.Key Words:healthy aging, mentors, mentoring, social gerontology, life course perspectiveMy current work and life mantra is healthy aging is the new normal (Ory & Smith, 2017). Imagine my delight when I saw the recentNew York Timesopinion piece How 90 Became the New 60 (Collins, 2023). Aging has certainly been a journey for many of us, whether professionally or personally. One of my first aging truths, learned from the esteemed social gerontologist Matilda White Riley, was that aging was a life-course process and socially determined (Dannefer et al., 2005).There is always an origin story for any lifelong journey. For me it was seeing family members with different life trajectories and intuitively recognizing the interacting health influence of genetics, lifestyle factors, and place. Family is for life, and I value my more than 50-year marriage to Raymond Carroll, (including a nearly 20-year commuting relationship), who has encouraged me to follow my dreams and acted as the anchor for my returning to Texas after a 30-year hiatus.As I look back over my nearly 50 years of professional life, I can see stabilities and changes in my career path, as well as parallel paths in the field of gerontology. Like many in my generation, I did not start off as a trained gerontologist, but as a social scientist who asked questions about norms and sanctions affecting important early life decisions such as fertility and parenting (Ory, 1978). I landed my first academic job in the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina, knowing little about public health as a field of study but quickly appreciating the importance of community as context and an agent of change.The Value of Mentors Often it is hard to sustain friendships and collegial relationships over time and space. As a young academic, I benefited greatly from my association with JoAnne Earp (see UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health, 2022), who filled many roles as lifelong mentor, friend, and colleague. She instilled in me a passion for public health, and later in life a sense of appreciation and gratitude for others.My transition to aging as an area of study was definitely influenced by my social setting and mentors. My aging origin story began with a brief postdoctoral stint at the University of Minnesota in the late 1970s, where I gained an appreciation of how policies and programs affected families and the intergenerational aspects of long-term care, working with Reuben L. Hill and Nancy N. Eustis (Ory, 1980).It was in the early 1980s, with a freshly minted public health degree from Johns Hopkins University, that my public health and aging perspectives first began to coalesce. I feel fortunate to have had the privilege of starting my National Institute on Aging (NIA) career while Robert (Bob) N. Butler was still its first director. I can remember listening to his inspirational messages about confronting ageism stereotypes (Butler, 1969) and wishing that I could one day gain his vast knowledge about factors associated with aging well.My transition to aging as an area of study was definitely influenced by my social setting and mentors.This wish was realized through my long association with Matilda W. Riley and Ronald Abeles, and the opportunities they gave me to grow with and shape the Social Science Research on Aging program at the NIA.The 1980s and 1990s were exciting decades for moving the field of social gerontology forward, and establishing pillars of aging principles and solutions that hold true today. With incredible insight, Riley discussed the importance of viewing aging within a dynamic multidisciplinary approach but with a sharp lens on how social structures defined and were defined by aging (Dannefer et al., 2005). At this time, there was great lament about the confluence of two social conditionsan expanding aging population accompanied by a structural lag in roles and opportunities for older persons (Riley et al., 1994).Her call for social change can be seen in a more age-integrated view of society that results in greater flexibility and choice of roles throughout life. While still rarer than desired, I marvel at the growing examples of life-long education, creativity, and opportunities for meaningful work and social interactions at any age.In the health arena, it is almost axiomatic that it takes nearly 20 years to go from discovery to practice (Morris et al., 2011). Similarly, transformational social ideas take a while to become embedded. While all her projections for meaningful aging are not yet part of the social fabric, Rileys legacy is that aspects are continually rediscovered and recycled by a younger generation of scholars and partitioners who see value in a more age-integrated society.During my 20-year tenure at the NIA, I worked on a variety of issues setting the stage for my post-government academic life. Under Rileys leadership, we set up a Behavioral Geriatrics Research initiative to examine the dynamic interplay among aging, health, and behavioral processes (Ory et al., 1992).This work culminated in the coining of one of my favorite life-course lifestyle mantras, Its never too late to start a healthy behaviorbut always too soon to quit. And coming full circle, with nearly 20 years of immersion in the NIAs life-course perspective, I had the pleasure of joining forces with Bob Butler to host an invitational thought leader roundtable on Maintaining Healthy Lifestyles: A Lifetime of Choices.And, I had the distinct honor of working with the three NIA Directors, Bob Butler, T. Franklin Williams, and Richard J. Hodes. Each of them have put their own mark on the aging fieldbut with a common goal of furthering research to better understand the multidimensional aging processes and make a difference in the lives and roles of older people in society.What I especially liked about my tenure at the NIA starting as a youngish 30-something professional was working with leading scholars in the behavioral and social sciences on aging and having the opportunity to learn from these giants in the field. While many early gerontologists are unfortunately no longer with us, their work lives on as a legacy to aging research and practice. And of New Collaborations and Ways of Viewing Aging Research and PracticeBut equally rewarding was the opportunity to work with a younger generation of emergent scholars who have now come into their own as leading scholars and practitioners in the field. My favorite mechanisms were the cross-site collaborative projects around a focal topic such as Alzheimers disease, falls and injuries, lifestyle behavior, provider-patient interactions, or minority aging.Not surprisingly, in my current academic research, I remain engaged in these topics, which are still highly relevant to the health and well-being of older adults. I see some of the same issues being addressed, but with a slightly different focus.Coming to the Texas A&M School of Public Health in 2001 provided me with a new lens for my research and practice. Concurrent with a recent research shift toward translational research, I am now more likely to address questions of how evidence-based programs and practices can be scaled and sustained to benefit the maximum number of older adults, starting with my leadership in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Active for Life Initiative (Wilcox et al., 2008).As a public health researcher, I have a keen appreciation for the importance of working with key community stakeholders to help define the research process from beginning to end. Working on interdisciplinary teams with academics and practitioners, I have benefitted from the sage insights my architectural and planning colleagues have about environmental supports for facilitating or impeding healthy lifestyle factors, navigating ones environment with cognitive impairment, or designing long-term care environments to minimize infections and falls, while simultaneously enhancing social interactions (Ory et al., 2020).The longer I spend in the field, the more I appreciate its research complexities and the ever-evolving aging population and changing social context.Now my passion is identifying and evaluating social, behavioral, environmental, and/or technological solutions that can make healthy aging a reality for more older adults while simultaneously supporting their families and communities. Increasingly, I employ the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) translational dissemination and implementation framework, asking whom these programs are reaching, what intended and unintended consequences they have, how they are being adopted and implemented, and the extent to which benefits are sustained at the individual and organizational levels (Glasgow et al., 2019). The longer I spend in the field, the more I appreciate research complexities and the importance of recognizing that one is researching an ever-evolving aging population and changing social context (Ory, 2022).While much of my focus revolves around new ways of looking at long-standing age-relevant topics, the past few years have highlighted new public health problems that have substantial deleterious impacts, especially on our older population. Hence, my recent involvement in promoting opioid overdose education and harm reduction strategies within an ever-evolving opioid crisiswith waves from prescription misuse to illicit drug-takingthat can have quite deadly widespread population impacts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2022).Similarly, the recent COVID-19 pandemic underscored the vulnerabilities of older adults, who have borne a disproportionate share of morbidity and mortality, exacerbating existing fractures in healthcare and public health (Nicklett et al., 2022). Another new area for me is the recent attention to precision health, and its capacity to either accelerate or reduce existing health and healthcare inequities (Ory et al., 2023).Takeaways from 50 Years in GerontologyWhat can one say about nearly 50 years of professional experience in social gerontology interspersed with personal aging? I remain optimistic that population dynamics have brought new ways of thinking and actionwhether my long-ago 1970s graduate student foray into overpopulation depicted in Ehrlichs Population Bomb treatise (1968) or newer concerns about rapid population aging coexisting with declining life expectancies in the United States (Ory, 2020; 2022).I have had excellent mentors along my career pathand I hope I have served as mentors to others. While my pathway to senior gerontologist status might appear destined and straightforward, in retrospect, the road traveled takes many turns, some planned and some fortuitous. On a personal note, I attribute my insights into healthy aging to my mother, Esther Rose Levine Ory, who provided an excellent role model for successful aging and taught me the importance of viewing aging from both a research and practice perspective. On a professional level, social gerontologists have led the charge to reimagine aging (American Society on Aging, 2023), and I am proud to be one in long standing.My final thoughts are to stress the need to act locally but think globally. I urge us to all take to heart the WHOs (2023) four action pillars of the Decade of Healthy Aging including combating ageism, creating age-friendly environments, integrating healthcare, and not forgetting quality and accessibility issues in long-term care. These four pillars reflect the current moment of recognition that healthy aging is possible, the movement toward reframing aging, and the momentum to make Matilda Rileys vision of an age-integrated society a reality.EpilogueMany friends and colleagues ask me when I am going to retire. My first thought is hopefully never if retirement means no longer doing what one loves. Ive set three goals for myself of what Id like to accomplish in my professional career:To obtain one more multi-investigator grant, as I love the collaborative research processand fortunately I have several irons in the fire;To cap my career with at least 500 peer-reviewed articles of relevance to the social gerontology field;To continue mentoring the next generation of scholars and practitioners so that the healthy aging legacy lives on.But I think it is also important to have a post paid work-life plan. Toward this end, Ive recently set up a foundation, Healthy Across the Generations, to have a platform to continue supporting research, education, and service to personify the perspective: Active for Life Everyone, Every Day, Every Age.Marcia G.

MarkidesOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingJustice & EquityAbstract:In this article, I take a brief look at my understanding of the development of gerontology, mostly social gerontology, from the 1960s to today, through my career as a gerontologist since 1976. I comment on conceptual development, the quest for successful aging, ethnic minority and Hispanic aging, and the internationalization of gerontology. My views are based upon my decades of research as well as experience as the founding and current editor of the Journal of Aging and Health, which I founded in 1989.Key Words:health, Hispanics, minorities, immigrants, life course, successful agingI began my career in 1976 as a gerontologist at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in San Antonio, where part of my job was to conduct a survey of around 500 older people in a transitional area of San Antonio, two thirds of whom were Mexican Americans and one third non-Hispanic Whites. With two follow-up surveys completed in 1980 and 1984, we developed the first longitudinal study of older Mexican Americans, the results of which helped to establish a productive research program that included theThree-generations Study of Mexican Americans in San Antonioin the early 1980s, and later on theHispanic Established Population for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly(Hispanic EPESE), our long-term study of older Mexican Americans in the Southwestern United States.Below I provide an overview of my understanding of how gerontology has evolved from the 1960s to today, with some focus on conceptual development and ethnic minority aging. I also offer thoughts on changes in gerontology Ive witnessed as editor of theJournal of Aging and Healthacross the past 35 years. Then I draw conclusions and provide my perspective on where we are as a field and what I see as challenges and opportunities for us with respect to our near future, especially in light of the recent and growing internationalization of gerontology.The Search for the Good Old Age, Life Satisfaction, and Successful AgingIn my view, gerontology came of age in the 1960s with the lively debate between disengagement theory, originally proposed by Cumming and Henry (1961), and activity theory, which predated disengagement as it was originally articulated in 1953 by Havighurst and Albrect. But it was during the 1960s when it received serious attention that was stimulated to a great extent by the debate with disengagement theory (Havighurst et al., 1968; Lemon et al., 1972; Wylie, 1970).By far the most popular outcome of this research was the operationalizing of subjective well-being in terms of life satisfaction, morale, or adjustment to various aspects of aging and old age. Most prominent among dimensions of well-being was life satisfaction, usually measured by the Life Satisfaction Index (LSI-A) proposed by Neugarten and colleagues (1961). George Maddox also published influential papers on the relationship between activity and morale (Maddox, 1963; Maddox & Eisdorfer, 1962). And in 1975 Powell Lawton published the updated Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (Lawton, 1975).All of this coincided with the establishment of the National Institute on Aging in the 1970s, along with increases in its funding programs.Measures of depressive symptoms replaced life satisfaction and morale as the favored outcomes of gerontological studies in the 1980s and beyond. In 1977 Radloff had published The CES-D Scale: A self-report depression scale for research in the general population, which quickly became the favorite measure of psychological well-being of gerontologists and others studying the general adult population. Before long, researchers lost interest in life satisfaction as the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) captured depression, an outcome that could be impacted, whereas people had begun to think there wasnt a whole lot that could be done about life satisfaction.Healthy life expectancy has become a favorite measure of a populations health that is easily quantified and monitored.As a continuous measure, the CES-D captured the average number of depressive symptoms in populations. A score of 16 and over was thought to approximate clinical depression, though experts have cautioned against calling it depression. Gerontologists and other social scientists found a useful measure of depressive symptomatologypsychological distressor overall psychological well-being at any age. Funding agencies welcomed applications using the CES-D, something that can somehow be impacted. And Radloffs paper has been cited more than 60,000 times, which must be a record for any publication proposing a new measure.At the same time, theoretically oriented gerontologists had begun debating what constitutes successful aging while broadening their formulations. In 1989 Carol Ryff proposed a positive view of successful aging as consisting of dimensions of well-being such as self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth (Ryff, 1989, p. 35). This and other formulations of successful aging that emphasized positive aspects of aging have been widely offered by others (see, for example, Baltes & Baltes, 1993; Rowe & Khan, 1987; Vaillant & Mukamal, 2001). Also, the focus of health-oriented gerontologists and demographers shifted away from extending life to extending active, healthy, and happy life, the major focus of the health expectancy field. Healthy life expectancy has become a favorite measure of a populations health that is easily quantified and monitored (Stiefel et al., 2010). Others have proposed and calculated disability-free and disabled life expectancy (e.g., Farina et al., 2021). Such formulations of aging have become dominant among gerontologists, demographers, epidemiologists, and others (Jagger et al., 2020).Conceptual Approaches to Aging in Ethnic Minority PopulationsIn the 1970s and into the 1980s the dominant perspective on aging among African Americans centered on the notion of double jeopardy, or the double-disadvantage of being Black and old or growing old. Instead of originating in a scholarly tradition, the double jeopardy hypothesis had its origins in attempts of certain advocacy groups (National Council on Aging, 1972; National Urban League, 1964) to highlight the disadvantage of older Blacks in such important areas as income, health, housing, and life satisfaction.Dowd and Bengtson (1978) attempted to formalize the double jeopardy hypothesis and evaluate it with data on middle-age and older Blacks, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites in Los Angeles. Their formulation suggested that disadvantages of minority populations earlier in life (middle-age) in income, health, primary group relations, and psychological well-being would widen in old age. Their cross-sectional analysis found some support with regard to income and self-rated health but not in primary group relations or psychological well-being. But larger studies with national data and more objective measures of health and better measures of income found consistent evidence that both income and health differences between Blacks and Whites actually decline in old age, supporting what had been called the age-as leveler rather than the double jeopardy hypothesis (Ferraro, 1987; Markides, 1983; Ward, 1983).No such consistent evidence was found between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. Both Ferraro (1987) and Markides (1983) suggested that the decline among Blacks might be partly attributable to the often-observed racial mortality crossover in that Blacks who survive to advanced old age may be disproportionately more physically (and socially) robust than Whites who survive to advanced old age (Manton & Poss, 1977; Wing et al., 1985). I was so fascinated by this literature that, with the help of a colleague, I developed a selective survival perspective and outlined its consequences on health, suicide rates, and status of older adults among high mortality populations (Markides & Machalek, 1984).While the double-jeopardy hypothesis made much sense intuitively, assessing it empirically was often difficult due to a reliance on cross-sectional data. A conceptually broader perspective that subsumed race/minority status and age was the multiple hierarchy stratification perspective, which also included class and gender (Bengtson, 1979). In this formulation the bottom of the hierarchy would be occupied by poor, older women from minority populations, while the top would be occupied by upper- or middle-class and middle-age White men, with others falling somewhere in between.While this formulation has received some attention in recent literature (see, for example, Brown et al., 2016), a parallel formulation that has achieved considerable prominence is intersectionality, which had its origins in Black feminist theory (Collins, 2002; Crenshaw, 1989) and has received increasing attention in studies of health inequality and race/minority status (e.g., Evans, 2019; Green et al., 2017; Richman & Zucker, 2019). Attention by gerontologists and life-course researchers has been somewhat limited (Calasanti & Giles, 2018). But intersecting age with gender, minority status, and socioeconomic status sounds a great deal like the multiple hierarchy stratification perspective.The healthy immigrant effect has found its parallel in Australia and Canada, the other two traditional immigrant destinations.A more dominant life-course or aging perspective has been cumulative disadvantage/ advantage theory. As a life-course perspective, it owes a great deal to the work of Glen Elder (1994) and views differentiation throughout the life course, including the influence of early life conditions (Ferraro et al., 2016).Attempts to cross-fertilize social science and age theory have been made by ORand (1996) and by Dannefer (2003) and has been applied by gerontologists to life-course differentiation with respect to race/ethnicity and minority status, and to some extent to immigrant status (Markides & Rote, 2019). And a synthesis of intersectionality and life-course analyses to better understand unequal aging was recently offered by Holman and Walker (2021) who also have noted its relevance to other groups defined by disability, LGBT status, and other statuses differentiated by discrimination and related factors.Hispanic Health and AgingWork on Hispanic health and aging in the 1980s was motivated by our studies in San Antonio but also by our conceptual work, which proposed a Hispanic Epidemiological Paradox of a relatively favorable mortality and health profile of Hispanics despite relatively lower socioeconomic status and associated risk factors (Markides & Coreil, 1986). The paradox was attributed primarily to a healthy immigrant effect and possibly strong family systems.By the 1990s the evidence began showing lower mortality rates for the Hispanic population than for non-Hispanic Whites, but there were questions about the quality of the populations mortality data as well as attributing possible advantages to a salmon bias, or the tendency of less healthy Hispanic older people to return to their home countries. While the salmon bias found some support, it was too small to account for the populations mortality advantage (Turra & Elo, 2008). And, importantly, by 2010 the National Center for Health Statistics was able to publish for the first time official life tables on the Hispanic population that were based upon data adjusted for misclassification of ethnicity on death certificates and other data artifacts.These life tables estimated a two-and-a-half-year advantage in the life expectancy of the Hispanic population over that of non-Hispanic Whites, and a much larger advantage over the life expectancy of the African-American population (Arias, 2010). And with considerable attention by scholars as well as the media, the Hispanic Paradox has become an established hypothesis that has guided the field of Hispanic health.So, what about the field of Hispanic aging? What did data from the Hispanic EPESE have to say about the Hispanic Paradox? Our data have clearly suggested that, while Mexican Americans, as well as other Hispanics, are long-living populations, they do so with poorer health and more disability at older ages. Clearly part of the story of the healthy immigrant effect is that immigrants to the United States arrive with better health but lose their advantage within 10 to 20 years by adopting the native U.S. populations bad health behaviors and high obesity rates (Antecol & Bedard, 2006). But the Hispanic EPESE and other data had always found evidence of high rates of obesity, as well as diabetes in older Mexican Americans at younger ages. And data on trends in the health of Mexican Americans ages 75 and older found substantial increases in self-reported diabetes among men and women from the early 1990s until the middle-2000s (Beard et al., 2009; Markides & Gerst, 2011).This increase in the prevalence of self-reported diabetes was accompanied by significant increases in activities of daily living (ADL) disability and cognitive impairment, as well as slight increases in obesity and hypertension. These increases were opposite to the experience of the non-Hispanic White population, which was experiencing improvements in the health of older people at that time. We concluded that the older Mexican-American population (really at all ages) was at a similar stage in the epidemiological transition that the non-Hispanic White population had been in in the 1970s and early 1980s, when increases in life expectancy were accompanied by increases in the prevalence of morbidity and disability (see, also, Markides & Eschbach, 2011).And the healthy immigrant effect, including convergence to native levels, has found its parallel in Australia and Canada, the other two traditional immigrant destinations where immigrants went to stay. Importantly the healthy immigrant effect applies mostly to voluntary immigrants but not to refugees such as the Vietnamese population in the United States and elsewhere (Markides & Rote, 2019).The Internationalization of GerontologyI started theJournal of Aging and Healthin 1989, a time when gerontology was dominated by the United States and to some extent by Australia, Canada, and Western European countries. During the journals first few years only a handful of submissions and published papers came from countries other than the United States, namely Canada, Sweden, and Denmark. And by far the favorable health outcome at that time was physical disability typically measured by ADLs and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). Measures of depressive symptoms such as the CES-D were the most popular mental health measures, not just at theJournal of Aging and Health, but at other mainstream social and behavioral gerontology journals.By the 1990s social and health gerontologists increasingly incorporated measures of physical function/mobility that included a timed short walk, repeated chair stands, balance measures, and measures of strength such as a handgrip measure (Guralnik et al., 2000). These performance measures have become very popular because they predict important outcomes such as disability and mortality in a variety of populations in longitudinal studies and are relatively easy to administer in respondents homes.In the United States a major development was the establishment of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) in the early 1990s to follow large samples of middle-age and older Americans longitudinally. And before long the English Longitudinal Study was established and then the SHARE (Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe) longitudinal studies collected data on 20 European countries. Health and Retirement longitudinal sister studies have since been established in numerous other countries throughout the world.As a gerontologist for almost five decades, I have seen quite a bit of progress in our understanding of the aging process.With such increasing interest in aging and health in so many parts of an aging world, we have seen a major internationalization of gerontology, especially health gerontology, most profoundly so in the first couple of decades of the 21st century. During the 3-year period of 20202022, for example, theJournal of Aging and Healthreceived an average of 1,300 new submissions per year, more than 70% of which originated in other counties, led by China, Brazil, and India, in that order. Other developing countries submitting significant numbers have included Mexico, South Africa, Malaysia, Thailand, Iran, and others. My understanding from speaking to other editors is that other journals have had similar experiences.Of course, the internationalization of the field has been a welcome development and promises to give a boost to gerontology conceptually, through longitudinal cross-country and cross-region comparisons. In my opinion this has not happened yet as many of the papers originating in the developing world are replicating analyses on outcomes done in the United States and other western countries, some of which were abandoned some time ago, such as searching for the correlates of life satisfaction and self-rated health. But many important and methodologically sophisticated publications have increasingly originated in some developing countries, especially China.And what are recent trends in health gerontology from an editors viewpoint? The most obvious trend in recent years has been the replacement of disability by cognitive function and dementia as the key outcome of interest, no doubt to a great extent due to the huge increase in recent decades in Alzheimers disease funding by the National Institute on Aging. Another trend here and elsewhere has been the diversification of outcomes, which might indicate successful aging. These continue to include such measures as depressive symptoms, and increasingly measures of cognitive function, sleep, resilience, and social isolation and loneliness, the latter becoming especially prominent because of the pandemic. And there has also been increasing attention paid to contextual factors such as neighborhoods, the community context, and the built environment.Concluding ThoughtsThis overview of gerontology, more specifically social gerontology, is as I see it based on my limited and personally biased perspective as a social gerontologist based in a medical center in the United States. As such what I see as important in our field is based on my long-term research on minorities, mostly Mexican Americans, but also as editor of a major journal. In terms of conceptual development regarding ethnic minority aging, a great deal of progress has been made by viewing advantage/disadvantage and inequality throughout the life course with a major focus on how early life conditions influence peoples lives in their later years. And a synthesis of cumulative advantage/disadvantage and intersectionality perspectives (e.g., Holman & Walker, 2021) is relevant to understanding unequal aging beyond race/ethnicity to include such statuses differentiated by gender, social class, sexual identity, disability, religious affiliation, and others. In health gerontology we now speak about health disparities, for example, to encompass all of the above and other factors in the United States well as in other western countries. And especially in the United States the goal goes beyond equality to focus on achieving equity as in the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) efforts by educational and scientific institutions.Gerontologists and others will continue searching for the formulas for successful aging that go beyond defining success as not being physically disabled. Who is to say that Stephen Hawkins, for example, did not age successfully? Formulations such as the one proposed by Carol Ryff and discussed earlier present a viable blueprint for any group, community, or society anywhere.With respect to ethnicity and ethnic minority status we have seen progress in examining diversity in understudied groups such as those of Asian, Middle-Eastern, and other origins not just in the United States but also in other Western countries. And increasingly gerontologists in developing countries and regions are turning to investigating ethnic and minority diversity in their own backyards. The internationalization of gerontology is welcome for a variety of reasons, including that research in the developing world promises to improve the lives of older people. It also provides an opportunity for us to broaden our perspectives to the benefit of all. And in speaking of internationalization, an important and rapidly growing trend that needs more serious attention by gerontologists and others are the millions of people being uprooted from their home environments and transplanted to new environments. The lives of aging refugees as well as the lives of older people left behind in troubled regions by outmigration deserve considerably more attention.As a gerontologist for almost five decades, I have seen quite a bit of progress in our understanding of the aging process, especially by more serious study of the life course and the influence of early life conditions on later life. And in health gerontology we have made significant progress in incorporating the influence of the social and community context in our work. Perhaps an important challenge for the future will be the incorporation of the societal context in our understanding of aging, as well as contributing to the improvement of the lives of older people everywhere, as well as the lives of all at all ages.Acknowledgements: I am grateful to Mark Luborsky, editor of this special issue of Generations for inviting my contribution and for useful and encouraging feedback throughout the development of this manuscript.Kryiakos S.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2023In Praise of Adventure: Changing the Narrative of Later LifeBy William L. RandallOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:For many of us, aging is viewed and experienced in essentially tragic terms: as a narrative of decline, a downward trajectory to decrepitude and death. Such a way of storying later life can set us up for (among other things) narrative foreclosure, which can feed the depression to which we are susceptible in the face of agings many challenges. This article presents an alternative and more positive narrative of later life. Drawing on ideas from narrative gerontology, it outlines how aging can be re-genre-ated from tragedy to adventure in at least four main directions: Outward, Inward, Backward, and Forward.Key Words:adventure, biographical aging, conscious aging, narrative gerontology, spiritualtyA 2010New York Timesarticle, Seeing Aging as a Never-Ending Adventure, tells of Englishman Tom Lackey wing-walking in his 80s as a way of getting past the sadness of losing his wife. [H]e strapped his feet to the top of a single-engine biplane and flew across the English Channel at 160 mph. As if this werent enough, his plan was to prepare for his 90th birthday by being the first of any age to wing-walk it in both directions. Noted Lackey of these exploits, numbering at least 20, My family thinks Im mad, to which he added, I probably am (Johnson, 2010).Agingas adventure Though it seems a contradiction in terms and though Lackeys version of adventure is, literally, over the top, this is the metaphor to whichas a recent retireeI find myself drawn. And its one I invite anyone, old or young, to entertain.I've long been interested in the metaphors we live by (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), one in particular: life asstory. Beginning with my book,The Stories We Are(Randall, 1995/2014), this interest has had me pulling on insights from narrative psychology, literary studies, and other disciplines to articulate anarrativeperspective on later life, or a narrative gerontology. According to this perspective, our lives as we experience them subjectively arestories, forever unfolding, often shifting course, continually thickening with meaning. They are flesh-and-blood novels that we compose and re-compose in memory and imagination as author, narrator, protagonist, and reader, more or less at once.Inspired by such a perspective, Ive spent my career pondering the poetics of aging (Randall & McKim, 2008), namely how such familiar elements of stories as plot, character, genre, and theme can illuminate the internal dynamics of development in later life, its biographical dynamics. Besides representing a unique starting point for approaching vast topics like wisdom and spirituality, this way of thinking opens a space for seeing aging as a process of not just getting old but actively, consciously growing old.Regarding the element of genre, stories come, of course, in different types. For Christopher Booker (2004) inThe Seven Basic Plots, they include not just tragedy and comedy, but such archetypal storylines as Rags to Riches, Voyage and Return, Overcoming the Monster, and The Quest.This way of thinking opens a space for seeing aging as a process of not just getting old but actively, consciously growing old.Given these options, we are at liberty to alter how we story later life, and not stay stuck in the tragic trajectory by which aging is often perceived and which can lead to narrative foreclosure (Bohlmeijer et al., 2011). By this I mean the conviction that, though our life continues, our story has effectively ended; no new chapters are apt to be written.Such a conviction is a recipe for depression, which is treated as a medical matter, when what is needed is not another pill so much as a better story: a counter-story to the portrayal of aging as a problem to be solved, a fate to be fought, a downward drift to decrepitude and death. We need to re-genre-ate how we talk about aging, to shift from a rhetoric of decline to one of discovery, of quest, ofadventure.Aging as AdventureOne ally in the mission to change the narrative of later life is Florida Scott-Maxwell (1968).In The Measure of My Days, written in her 80s, she made several soulful observations. When you truly possess all you have been and done, she said, you are fierce with reality (p. 42).I want to tell people approaching and perhaps fearing age, she wrote, that it is a time of discovery. If they say, Of what?, I can only answer, we must each find out for ourselves, otherwise it wont be discovery (p. 142).She spoke, too, of how she and others her age seem to lead the way into the unknown; of how all is uncharted and uncertain (p. 139). Unknown, uncharted, uncertainthis is all adventure-talk, and we have the option to adopt such talk as we journey into later life.I'm hardly the first to combine aging with adventure. Betty Friedan (1993) devoted a whole chapter to that combination in her book,The Fountain of Age. Certainly, a burgeoning business of gero-tourism is enticing people ages 50 and older with sufficient means to take up everything from skydiving off cliffs to hiking in the Himalayas, escapades looked to as examples of positive aging, successful aging, or other up-beat mantras that have their merits, to be sure. I'm all for resisting ageist assumptions about how seniors ought to think and act. And we neednt take anything away from off-the-charts achievements by Lackey and the like in the campaign for healthy, active aging. They inspire us to rise up from our couches, toss aside our canes, and just do it.But such campaigns, albeit well-intentioned, only scratch the surface. There are other less expensive, less dangerous, and deeper, more fulfilling avenues to adventure in later life, perhaps four in particular.Before I outline them, lets consider the word adventure. Used so cavalierly, defining it has become a challenge. (As is defining tragedy, for in its classical forms there is a degree of redemption at work. In the middle of the protagonists demise, some insight is attained, some moral truth grasped.)In essence, an adventure is a reaching out or a venturing forth toward some goal or prize, some destination, however dimly envisioned, that lies ahead. So conceived, adventures can be either firsthand, like competing in sports, or vicarious, like feeling the adrenaline of the play-by-play from the safety of our sofas. And they can be small or large in scale, from a weekend road trip to more existential ventures such as leaving home and heading off to college, or to war; or falling in love and starting a familyor beginning all over with somebody new!Only quite recently has aging been seen as a naturallyspiritualizing process.Creative activities of countless kinds can be adventures. This is the essence of Art: something new comes into being that wasnt there before. Life, with its ups and downs, discoveries and disappointments, is arguably an adventure! So, too, is science: the entire enterprise of asking questions, gathering information, and pushing back the frontiers of our knowledge. The key is that there is a measure of unpredictability at work, of trial and error, suffering and surprise, courage and risk, and the possibility, at any turn, of failure. Otherwise, its not an adventure but a commute, like driving to the mall.As with any story worth its salt, there must be some trouble to make it worth telling. No trouble, no tale. Conveniently, aging itself brings all manner of troublesarthritis and diabetes, cancer and dementia, bereavement and lossto complicate the plot. But it is precisely because of this, because of our apprenticeship with sorrow (Weller, 2015, pp. 110), that our horizons are widened, that we learn and grow, that aging is an odyssey, an adventure.Adventure OutwardFirst, though in no necessary order, is theadventure outward. This includes anything that pulls us out of our comfort zones and takes us to fresh places, from wing-walking at one end of the spectrum to playing piano at the other, with all manner of horizon-stretching undertakings in between: traveling to countries weve long pined to see, pursuing subjects weve been curious about for years, joining a club or a cause and forging friendships we might not have made while raising our kids. Sooner or later, though, such adventures nudge us to inquire within. If my family thinks Im mad, Mr. Lackey might eventually wonder, then perhaps they have a point Adventure InwardThis is part of what Erik Erikson envisioned in proposing that, in his eighth stage of development, the route to ego integrity islife review(Erickson, 1963). Carl Jung claimed that, in the afternoon of life, it is our duty to turn inward (Jung, 1976). Not that honoring that duty is easy. The longest journey, its been said, is the journey inward. This is the longest and most uncharted, for it is where aging converges with spirituality. And in mainstream gerontology, its only quite recently, really, that this convergence has received its share of attention, that aging has been seen as a naturallyspiritualizingprocess, much like it is in many Indigenous cultures and traditional societies. One avenue to the adventure inward is looking back across our past.Adventure BackwardTheautobiographical adventure, as I call it, has received comparatively more attention, and from no less a pioneer of gerontology than Jim Birren. His program of guided autobiography (Birren & Deutchman, 1991)which entails writing short pieces about our lives related to pre-set themes like health, education, or love and sharing our writing with othersis one of many fine strategies for possessing all that we have been and done. By this I mean re-acquainting ourselves with the various experiences, major or minor, intentional or accidental, that have comprised our lives across the yearsnot just the same-old, same-old of day-to-day existence, but what sticks out as dramatic, ecstatic, ironic, or odd as key turning-points in our life-course overall.It is these experiences that were most likely to look back on as lending content and color to our identity and rendering our life worth living. When we invite an older adult to tell me your story, what theyre likely to recount are not all the times that they did X or Y, but this one time when I was walking to work and... was bit by a dog, or hit by a bus, or met my future spouse.Yet the adventure backward is not always the joyful jaunt down memory lane that we might hope. Reflecting seriously upon the past, as in any adventure worthy of the word, means dealing with the positives and negatives alike, making it an adventure downward as well. It means opening ourselves to the many layers of our inner world, not knowing in advance what secrets will be uncovered in our inquiries, what hurts unearthed, what demons or dreams awakened, what backstories will emerge from the shadows and beg to be told. And we cant know, until we get into it, what patterns of thinking and feeling will come to light that, earlier in our lives, we lacked the distance to discern, what unfinished developmental business will ask to be acknowledged.Adventure ForwardHere, we enter territory thats particularly contested. As if aging as adventure weren't controversial enough, aging as adventureforwardseems, frankly, oxymoronic! What, really, is there to look forward to? Were born, we suffer, we die ... end of story, a story with no intrinsic meaning to begin with.Given the materialistic-medical paradigm that dominates our modern world, it is seen as silly to assume that aging might actuallyleadsomewhere, might be a preparation for something, and that dying, whatever form it takesheart attack, cancer, or dementiamight be a beginning as much as an end.But if its possible to reimagine the story of dementia (Freeman, 2022), then why not reimagine death? Those working with people at the end-of-life, for instance, have attested to how, for some, dying feels less like a termination than a transition, a birth almost (Banerjee, 2005). What is more, research into so-called near-death experiences (or NDEs) has suggested that aging itself be seen as anearingdeath experience.InConsciousness Beyond Life: The Science of the Near-Death Experience, cardiologist Pim van Lommel (2011) describes an NDE as both an existential crisis and an intense learning experience (p. 329). People who have had themwhen their heart stopped functioning while they were lying on the operating table or were pinned beneath a truckreport remarkably similar features to their sojourns on the other side: traveling down a tunnel toward the light, undergoing a panoramic review of their lives, feeling loved in ways theyve never felt before, and finding that the reality theyre exposed to is realeror fiercerthan that of ordinary life.And they go on to experience similarly transformative effects upon their return: a decreased interest in material possessions, a broadened sense of time, an appreciation for the interconnectedness of everything and everyone, a desire to learn unlike any theyve known, and an enormous reduction in their fear of death, even a looking ahead to it.What is needed is a perspective on our finitude that leaves the door open for our infinitude as well.It calls to mind Lars Tornstams (1996) theory ofGerotranscendence, according to which those in very late life naturally experience a blurring of the boundaries between self and other, present and past, life and death. It points, too, to the fledgling field of transpersonal gerontology (see Wacks, 2011); transpersonal in the sense that our livesand with them our aging and dyingoccur within a far vaster context than a biomedical one. I mean a cosmic context, that of the universe in all its multidimensional mystery, bursting with creativity at every level, from the quantum to the galactic. Accordingly, what is needed is a cosmology of death (Schlitz et al., 2011).What is needed is a perspective on our finitude (Baars, 2010) that leaves the door open for our infinitude as well, a perspective that scientist-mystic Teilhard de Chardin (2001/1957, p. 76) hints at with his beguiling image of the hidden mystery in the womb of death.Flying HighAging as adventure, not a sentence assigned us by a cold unconscious cosmos but a journey of discovery and becoming to be made with openness and awe, a falling upward, as it were (Rohr, 2011). Surely, though, this is Pollyanna-speak, the sort of happy-ever-after thinking that we ought to have grown out of long ago?Admittedly, the perspective Im proposing is just a story, one of many to which we might subscribe. The prevailing narrative in several circles, including gerontological ones, is of course that agingand with it, deathhas no intrinsic meaning at all. In Science Set Free, however, scientist Rupert Sheldrake (2012) took this narrative to task. Science, he maintained, has defaulted to a worldview that claim[s] that all reality is material or physical, and can be boiled down to chemistry and physics (p. 6). Among the 10 core beliefs around which it revolves and that most scientists take for granted (p. 7) are: that nature is purposeless, and evolution has no goal or direction; that minds are inside heads and are nothing but the activities of brains; that unexplained phenomena such as telepathy [and NDEs] are illusory; and that mechanistic medicine is the only kind that really works (p. 7f).Such a set of beliefs, he says, has become equated to what Science is. But it, too, is just a story, albeit a very powerful one which, he contended, restricts unbiased, open-minded investigation of the mysteries around us and in us, an investigation in which the line between science and spirituality, physics and meta-physics, is in fact quite fine.The upshot of Sheldrakes thinking for us is that we get to choose the stories by which we live, and age, and that the mechanistic-reductionistic narrative and, with it, the whole narrative of decline is not the only story in town. In a sense, this takes us back to Lackey Speaking at the recent funeral of her 15-year-old son, the victim of a stray bullet at a house-party scuffle that got out of hand, the sister of a Caribbean-American colleague of mine brought everyone to tears. Her arms around her three remaining teens, she shared with the congregation, of which he had been part, stories of how kind he was, how funny, how determined to succeed of how his final words were Im not afraid. To sum up his own view of life and to lift up the spirits of his pals, the phrase she kept repeating was fly high fly high fly high.We need to heed this womans words, uttered amidst the darkest nightmare and deepest sorrow that any parent can know. Where aging is concerned, we, too, need to set our sights high. For, just maybe, we've gotten the story wrong. To talk of aging asadventureoutward, inward, backward, and even forward toois one way, I say, to turn things around.William L.

Robbins-PankoOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:Increasingly popular global narratives of successful, active, and productive aging can create universalist models of a good old age. They also suggest that there exists an opposite: an unsuccessful, inactive, and unproductive old age. This article argues that we can reframe how we think about aging by focusing on meaningful everyday activities and aspects of the collective past. Drawing on ethnographic research in Poland, where the oldest generations have lived through dramatic sociocultural and political-economic transformations, the article suggests that we can create more complex and inclusive ways to talk about aging.Key Words:active aging, lifelong learning, care, ethnography, everyday life, Poland, Europe, postsocialismWhen I lived in Poland, I learned to think differently about how we talk about aging. I witnessed older adults who were striving to disrupt ageist stereotypes by living active, independent lives, and older adults who were suffering due to illness, loneliness, or poverty. That is, I saw examples of older adults whose experiences of aging aligned with the dominant cultural narratives of late life. These increasingly popular and globally circulating narratives create two opposing models of aging, as a time in the life course characterized by either success or failure, activity or passivity, productivity or unproductivity.But I also observed older adults whose experiences cannot be described by these models. Even for the older adults who seemed to fit into this dualistic paradigm, important elements of their lives were not represented within it. This binary framework cannot capture the complexities of late lifes experiences and meanings as they are lived by older adults, and can risk universalizing particular cultural ideals of late life (Lamb et al., 2017).To move beyond the binary, this article argues that directing research attention to meaningful everyday activities can offer new ways to think about aging. It draws upon long-term ethnographic research in Poland to argue that experiences of aging occurring in contexts not specifically about aging can offer new insights and help us to reframe how we talk about aging.Such reframing highlights aging as an experience fundamentally shaped by the society, culture, politics, and economics of a particular place, in a particular time. Like other times in the life course, aging is a profoundly local experience. To understand local ideals of aging, it is necessary to examine experiences and meanings of aging in their sociocultural and political-economic contexts. Ethnographic research is well suited to this endeavor because of its inductive approach, which builds meaningful categories of analysis from observing specific empirical phenomenon rather than predetermining these categories. For instance, rather than presuming that physical and social activity contribute to a good old age, and then documenting the quantity and quality of those activities, ethnographic research asks what types of activities contribute to a good old age according to the perspective of older adults themselves, and how the contemporary and historical context have shaped these activities. Ethnographic research takes a culturally relative perspective by attempting to understand a particular phenomenon within its own terms.Poland offers a productive example to think about contextual dimensions of aging because older Poles have lived through multiple dramatic political-economic and sociocultural transformations. The oldest generations in contemporary Poland were born before World War II and have lived through the devastation and losses of that war, the redrawing of the countrys boundaries after the war, the imposition of state socialism by the Soviet Union, the collapse of that system, the introduction of market democracy, and entry into the European Union.All these transformations occurred not only at the national level, but also at the personal level. In other words, these changes were not only in the realms of politics, economics, and geography, but also in everyday life and in how people understood themselves and their place in the world (Verdery, 1996). This is a tremendous amount of change to occur during one lifetime. Aging in Poland, then, is an exemplary case through which to explore how experiences of aging connect to sociocultural and political-economic context.Older Poles learning English in contemporary Poland, then, are part of a deeper history of class aspirations.To explore the social roles and cultural meanings of aging in Poland, I conducted 22 months of ethnographic fieldwork between 2006 and 2014 in two cities in western Poland, Wrocaw and Pozna (see Robbins, 2021, for a more extensive presentation of this research). I sought out field sites that were associated with active aging as well as those associated with its opposite, institutional long-term care. Additionally, because none of these sites demonstrated typical experiences of aging in Poland, I sought out other contexts that were neither cultural ideals nor their opposite. These included neighborhood senior clubs, parish clubs, and allotment gardens.Methods included participant observation, the hallmark of ethnographic research, involving dual subjectivities of doing and observing. What this meant in practice shifted by context. In lifelong learning institutions, I attended classes with older adults and led a conversational English class. In long-term residential care, I accompanied residents to physical therapy sessions and Catholic mass, shadowed a nurses aide, and kept residents company. In senior clubs and parish clubs I participated in club activities, and at allotment gardens I participated in gardening and joined in social gatherings. I also conducted semi-structured and open-ended interviews with older adults, staff, and local aging activists.Active Aging in PolandIn contemporary Poland, active aging programming is proliferating, as the European Union and national, regional, and local governments aim to promote the health of the growing aging population. One of the most prominent forms of active aging in Poland is the University of Third Age (UTA), a type of lifelong learning institution popular in Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world. The concept of the third age is an idealized time in the life course in which one has retired from the labor force and can contribute to society in other ways, such as through volunteering (Laslett, 1996).The third age runs counter to the fourth age, which is supposedly characterized by dependence and decrepitude (Laslett, 1996, p. 192). UTAs exist in large cities and small towns, and vary in institutional form, with some formally affiliated with local universities and others existing as stand-alone organizations. These institutions are popular with older Poles; for instance, in Wrocaw, multiple UTAs regularly turn away interested older adults due to lack of capacity.The programming at UTAs is quite diverse. At the UTA at the University of Wrocaw, there are classes in academic subjects such as physics and psychology, and activities such as sailing, choir, and handicrafts. Classes in foreign languages, especially English, were popular. I taught conversational English classes during my research, and many older adults shared that they were learning English to communicate with their childrens spouses and grandchildren in the United Kingdom. (Many Poles emigrated to the UK after 2004, when Poland joined the European Union, as it was legal for Poles to work there without a visa.) This geopolitical context shaped discursive framings of active aging.The meanings of active aging in Poland have to do with the national transformations that older Poles experienced and the changing imaginations of the proper place of Poland in the world. Particularly important is the transition from socialism to capitalism, such that active aging includes aspiring to a kind of old age that aligns with supposed Western ideals. For instance, a former institutional leader in Wrocaw spoke of creatingEuroseniorzy(Euroseniors.) She aimed to accomplish this through practices explicitly connected with the EU, such as taking older adults on trips to the EU parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg and to meet their representatives.Others were less explicit, like helping older adults to become open instead of closed in their attitudes toward the world, and in their interest in learning new skills and meeting new people. One NGO called @ctive Senior taught participants how to use ATMs and invest in the stock market, and to take responsibility for their health, as opposed to being passive and following directions from doctors. Both institutional leaders and older Poles considered these activities a transition away from the socialist past and toward individual and national belonging in the EU and the world.But, although some of the activities of the UTAs, such as learning English and visiting the EU Parliament, were connected to recent sociopolitical changes, they also resonated with older forms of sociality and education. UTAs have existed in Poland since the 1970s and have been teaching foreign languages since that time. Additionally, Poles have been learning foreign languages for generations, especially during the partition era, as a way to access cultural prestige. Older Poles learning English in contemporary Poland, then, are part of a deeper history of class aspirations.Moreover, UTAs included more than learning new skills; older Poles also engaged in activities in which they had participated earlier in their lives. Although institutional leaders and participants did not discuss these activities (e.g., handicrafts, choir) as frequently as other topics, they were still an important element of the life of the UTA. The national past was also evident in some of these activities, such as choirs and cabaret performances. Topics such as Pope John Paul II, who was Polish and is beloved in Poland to this day, and the now-Ukrainian city of Lviv, which used to be part of Poland and has multiple links to the current city of Wrocaw, were common. Continuity exists in contemporary practices of active aging at both individual and national levels.At the UTAs multiple activities, participants described new friendships as one of the most important aspects of their time there. Unlike in earlier phases of life, older Poles felt they now had time to make new friendsand importantly, these new friendships were based upon affinity, distinguishing them from relations like coworkers and neighbors. They associated these relations not only with this new phase of life, but also with Polands recent Westward orientation, in contrast to the socialist past, in which social relations had a utilitarian quality. For older Poles at the UTAs, active aging has elements of aspiration toward a new way of life, and connections to the shared past. In other words, this is a form of aging in which values of commonality, sociality, and collectivity are equally as important as individuality and independence.Creating Meaning Through Storytelling, Gardening, and Other Everyday ActivitiesIn Poland, living in long-term care such as nursing homes is a stigmatized way to receive care in late life. There is a longstanding cultural norm of living at home in late life, and a strong preference to be cared for at home, among family, rather than to be cared for by paid workers (uszczyska, 2021). In addition to this stigma, there is also a shortage of beds in long-term residential care. In 2015, only 3.4% of older adults who were categorized as dependent resided in long-term care institutions, while 4.6% received paid home care (The World Bank, 2015).I expected that long-term care would reflect this stereotype and that residents would feel isolated and marginalized. Although there certainly were some residents who experienced their time in care facilities this way, there were others who were able to live lives they felt were satisfying. At the level of everyday life, the experiences of older Poles in institutional care were quite similar to those of participants at the UTAs.One even told me he credited his garden with keeping him alive during and after cancer treatments.Across multiple contexts, older Poles formed connections with others by telling stories, learning new skills, and sharing food and drink. For instance, in a long-term rehabilitation center, one older woman who had been a farmer often told stories about her own bodily suffering after the stroke that had caused her to move from her home to this care facility. She interwove stories of her suffering with that of the Polish nation, describing the difficulties of life during state socialism. Just as the framework of Polish history mattered for older Poles at UTAs who learned English and new skills as a way of aligning with Polands recent Westward orientation, so, too, did older Poles in institutional care make sense of their lives in terms of the national past.Although the skills they acquired were quite differentlearning foreign languages or to use a computer at the UTAs, re-learning motor skills or how to operate a wheelchair in the rehabilitation centerthe activities were sources of meaning, connection, and satisfaction for older Poles.Finally, the sharing of food and drink was a key way of forming social relations, as attendees of UTAs shared coffee in a university cafeteria after class or residents of institutional care shared tea and snacks following class. Across both third- and fourth-age contexts, then, these meaningful everyday activities offered opportunities to experience a good old age.In contexts beyond the third and fourth ages, older Poles engaged in everyday practices that exceed binary understandings of aging. Older Poles went about their daily lives in ways that cannot be explained by concepts of either the third or fourth age. This is evident from my research at allotment gardens, places more typical for older adults to spend their time than either UTAs or institutional care. Many older Poles have had their gardens for decades; some have inherited them from kin. People often grow a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and flowers, and the allotments often have small sheds and outdoor seating where neighbors and friends can gather.Older Poles shared that they valued their allotment gardens as a respite from city life and as an escape from the tedium of staying at home in ones own apartment. They appreciated being outdoors among animals that they would not otherwise see. Some described allotment gardens as specifically Polish places; one older man commented that having ones own allotment garden, ones own property, was something that distinguished Poles from the tsarists to the East, meaning the Russians.During state socialism, Polish agriculture was never fully collectivized, so small farms existed throughout the socialist era, distinguishing Poland from its neighbors (Nagengast, 2019). Another proudly boasted of the hollyhocks he grew, describing them as our flower, which have a folkloristic quality. For several older Poles I knew, tending to their allotment gardens structured the rhythms of their days, weeks, and months. One even told me he credited his garden with keeping him alive during and after cancer treatments. At the gardens, older Poles created meaningful lives for themselves by creating and sustaining relations with particular places, plants, and people. There is a vital sociality to experiences of aging at allotment gardens that exceeds dominant binary, linear understandings of late life.ConclusionEthnographic research on aging in Poland demonstrates that older Poles create meaningful lives for themselves in ways that exceed normative binary understandings of old age. Foregrounding these everyday activities can help us to reframe how we think about aging. For instance, instead of interpreting daily life in a nursing home in a negative frame that focuses on experiences of dependence and suffering, we could take a more fine-grained interpretive perspective to explore what possibilities there might be for meaningful activities like storytelling, learning, and sharing food and drink.In turn, such reframing may offer new directions for social policies focused on aging. For instance, funding could support not only organizations such as Universities of the Third Age, but also organizations such as senior clubs and gardening groups. Reframing how we think about aging, then, may offer new possibilities for more inclusive social policies that can reach a broader segment of the population.This research also demonstrates that aspects of continuity matter as well as rupture, even in a place like Poland, where the oldest generations have lived through such dramatic violence. Paying attention to how the collective past comes to matter, in addition to individual biographies, can help to provide more nuanced analytic insights that better reflect the diversity of experiences of aging. That is, local, regional, and national histories can offer new insights into how older adults conceptualize their own lives. Understanding these shared pasts can help to localize how we think about aging. By using analytic language that aligns with older adults own experiences and ideals of late life, researchers, practitioners, and older adults can work against harmful and reductive stereotypes created by binary imaginaries of late life.Jessica C.

Using a Stockholm-based case study, it considers the need for spaces, places, and tools accessible to people who have cognitive decline to enable social citizenship, including age- and dementia-friendly communities. The case study, empirical research, and policy are discussed in relation to tools for mapping participation in a smart and digitalized society.Key Words:age-friendly, dementia-friendly, design, technology, occupational therapy, social citizenship, social participation the city could be considered as a text its user could be defined as the interpreter of urban space the city-text is made of people and things, of their relations and interactions.(Greimas, 1979, as cited in Terzoglou, 2018, p. 122)Designs for public spaces, places, and tools construct a storyline or script for how Johan (from the case study below), and all members of society participate in their everyday lives in the public space (i.e., outside the home). Such storylines influence not only the way we speak about aging but also can enable or disable older adults like Johan from participating in activities in the public space to enact their social citizenship. Social citizenship refers to a relationship, practice or status, in which a person with dementia is entitled to experience freedom from discrimination, and to have opportunities to grow and participate in life to the fullest extent possible (Bartlett, 2016, p. 37).Case Study: Johan Finding and Losing His WayJohan, age 68, was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease 2 years ago. He is a widower with two children who live far away, so he cannot rely on them to help him with the everyday activities of managing the home, finances, or grocery shopping. I love my apartment in the city, Ive lived here for years, and I want to keep my independence as long as I can, Johan says, although he is aware that the disease is progressing. He loves doing activities outside the home, including going for walks, meeting with friends, and visiting museum exhibits. Going out daily in his local neighborhood has become increasingly important as he is no longer able to travel the long distance to visit family.Lately, however, finding his way around has become doubly problematic. First, while he uses landmarks to find his way, those landmarks once thought stable are changing, a new block of apartments has replaced the community center, the post office closed, and there are several new stores that he no longer recognizes.Second, everyday activities such as grocery shopping are increasingly challenging. He has difficulties finding the groceries he prefers, especially when products are rearranged, or when the layout of local stores change. Previously, Johan could manage these minor changes easily without much thought, however, he doesnt feel as quick as he once was and with the increase of technologies such as self-service checkouts at stores, online banking, telemedicine, and automated travel passes on smartphones for public transport, he worries he will not be able to keep up.Modern technology, rather than enhancing accessibility, is making things more complicated and his neighborhood less accessible. Johans daughter suggested that he get his medicine delivered and even have his groceries and newspaper delivered. But Johan enjoys going out, getting fresh air, choosing the groceries himself, and speaking with the store assistants.Recently, Johans daughter has bought him a smartphone and a smartwatch to help him find his way and keep in contact with her. Johan wonders, Will this really help? Ill have to remember to charge and take the smartphone and smartwatch with me every time I go out, there are so many steps to make sure they work and Im not sure how I feel about being tracked.Modern technology, rather than enhancing accessibility, is making things more complicated and his neighborhood less accessible.Johan exemplifies the multiple ways the powerful unspoken language of human-built designs (from urban environments to devices) affords or hinders the ability of older persons to maintain full adult personhood and social citizenship. Social citizenship highlights the inherent need to participate in culturally, personally, and socially meaningful activities and places in the public space. It also expresses our ideals of freeing older persons from discrimination, whether explicit or implicit. While recently the normal script for participation has been adapted to consider affordances for physical accessibility in design and language, there remains a gap in evidence-based knowledge needed to inform interventions and design that accommodate cognitive impairments. This article addresses this issue, and the emerging discourse on the need for spaces, places, and tools that recognize the importance of cognitive accessibility to enable social citizenship, including age- and dementia-friendly communities.The Problem with Age- and Dementia-friendly CommunitiesParallel discourses influence how older adults enact their social citizenship through participation and interactions with human-built technologies in the public space (i.e., spaces, places, services, tools, and technologies), and in turn, older adults interactions shape the design and development of the public space. When we talk about aging, there is an ongoing tension between the ethos of universal design of inclusive communities for all members of society, and the adaptions and affordances for communities tailored to specific groups, i.e., age- and dementia-friendly communities. The former foregrounds smart technological solutions that promote cognitive accessibility according to our interactions with the technological environment. The latter emphasizes physical accessibility of the built environment in which technology is neglected or assumes a subsidiary role.On the one hand, international policies and legislation emphasize the need to promote equitable participation and inclusion for all members of society (e.g., the United Nations [2015] Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages; Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable).Digitalization is positioned as an integral part of creating more intuitive, inclusive, and smart cities and communities (European Commission, 2022). In cities such as Stockholm, there is a drive to make them smart, meaning cognitively and digitally intuitive places that promote connectivity through accessible data and digital platforms that communicate with each other via sensors and other technologies. In Johans case this means the ticket office is gone and there are fewer staffers at the public transport station to answer his questions, his senior travel pass is on an app on his smartphone (requiring a PIN), which he taps on a sensor to use public transport. The smart city makes Johans life more difficult.On the other hand, age- and dementia-friendly communities have become a policy goal for national governments and intergovernmental organizations (e.g., the European Commission and the World Health Organization), due to the increasing prevalence of people in their communities who are aging and living with dementia. Age- and dementia-friendly communities share a common goal to enable social engagement, confidence, health, and well-being, by compensating for disability through environmental adaptations and affordances. The design of age- and dementia-friendly communities has focused on physical accessibility (e.g., signage, lighting, seating, wayfinding) and some dementia awareness programs (van Hoof & Marston, 2021).In Johans Stockholm neighborhood, as in many other cities, there are ramps and lifts to enable access for wheelchairs, prams, and other mobility aids. But, when Johan faces cognitive challenges, such as remembering the directions to where he needs to go or the PIN for his smartphone to access his travel pass, theres little assistance or support available. He feels embarrassed to ask for help from strangers. Branding places and services as age- and dementia-friendly can help to raise awareness but these initiatives have been criticized for not actively including people with lived experiences in their design and/or development, and everyday technologies have been neglected or presented as subsidiary and neutral.A More Holistic View of Cognitive and Physical Aspects of AccessibilityContemporary debates on inclusive (age- and dementia-friendly) communities have tended to emphasize physical aspects of accessibility at the expense of cognitive considerations. Thus, there is a need to reconcile a more holistic view beyond the mind-body, corporeal-cerebral, cognitive-physical accessibility dichotomies, that considers physical and cognitive aspects, especially when it comes to designing increasingly smart and digital public spaces, places, and tools.During the pandemic, it became evident that digitalization in policymaking and research on age- and dementia-friendly communities had been overlooked (Reuter et al., 2020). The subsidiary role of technology for older adults has largely focused on assistive technology, such as memory aids or brain-training applications to decrease and/or prevent cognitive decline. These place the burden of responsibility on the older individual but have not been developed with the older adult user in mind. And research has revealed insufficient cognitive accessibility of privacy policies for health/wellness apps and websites in Sweden, the UK, and the Netherlands (Neal et al., 2023).Many assistive technologies place the responsibility on the older individual but have not been developed with them in mind.As communities become increasingly reliant upon technology, patterns of behavior, habits, and social norms associated with everyday technology use are evolving (Gaber, 2020; Peine & Neven, 2021). Increasingly, research challenges the assumption that technology performs a subsidiary or neutral role in the lives of older adults living with or without dementia (Gaber, 2020; Peine & Neven, 2021). Literature suggests that older adults, especially those who have dementia, experience increased challenges using everyday technologies in their activities of daily living and thus everyday technologies perform an important role in facilitating and/or disabling participation (Gaber, 2020; Hedman et al., 2017). Longitudinal research shows that decreasing everyday technology use is associated with decreasing participation in places in the public space among older adults living with dementia (Hedman et al., 2017).Without due consideration of older adults as mainstream technology users, like other members of society, there is a risk of segregating older adults into diagnostic/age-specific communities, which could exclude them from being involved in the ongoing discourse, design, and development of technologies and places they interact with every day.Designing Public Spaces, Places, and Tools Through the Lens of Social CitizenshipA framework of social citizenship provides a better way to think about these issues, a lens through which to understand the ways older adults (including those living with dementia) enact their agency and citizenship though participation in ordinary places in their community (Ward et al., 2021).Social citizenship adopts a strengths-based view of participation, whereby places in public space are viewed as zones of mastery, opportunity, and challenge (Ward et al., 2021). Older adults participate in places and activities in public space for various reasons (Brorsson, 2013), including health and well-being benefits such as social interaction (Livingston et al., 2020), mental health promotion (Odzakovic et al., 2020), cognitive stimulation (Evans et al., 2019), physical activity, and mobility (Odzakovic et al., 2020).However, health and well-being are not only individual concerns, because they are also socially constructed and relational (Gaber, 2020; Ward et al., 2021). Thus, older adults participation is not only motivated by functional, health, or mobility reasons. Participation in activities and places is also a way for older adults living with and without dementia to enact their social citizenship (Gaber, 2020).Social citizenship underscores that older adults living with and without dementia are active agents with personal autonomy, competencies, histories, rights, and responsibilities., which link the person to a community and country of residence (e.g., sense of familiarity, meaning, and place-making; Bartlett, 2016; Gaber et al., 2022). An older adult living with dementia can express their agency and self-determination through varying degrees of participation and this contrasts with the traditional, more biomedical views of dementia where the person with dementia is regarded as a passive victim of an inaccessible and shrinking world (Ward et al., 2021). Instead, the person with dementias changing participation reflects their sense of agency and choice to participate in some places within the public space but not in others. Agency also is linked to an older adult living with dementias use and non-use of different types of everyday technologies.Social citizenship underscores that older adults living with and without dementia are active agents with personal autonomy, competencies, histories, rights, and responsibilities.Social citizenship transcends the view of citizenship as a status bestowed upon people, in favor of the idea that citizenship is dynamic and enacted through participation in everyday and ordinary places and activities, such as Johan walking and socializing in his neighborhood. Earlier studies have explored everyday activities such as visiting a hair salon (Ward et al., 2016) or engaging in a social activity group as ways of co-constructing a sense of citizenship through shared interactions with the neighborhood and other people (Phinney et al., 2016).Tools for Mapping Participation in a Smart and Digitalized SocietyThe meaning of participation cannot be reduced to discrete units of analysis, rather the focus should be on the dynamic and ongoing transactions between people, the activities they perceive as meaningful, and their environments (Brorsson, 2013; Margot-Cattin et al., 2019). Transactions occur in multiple spatiotemporal planes and degrees of complexity. Measurements of existing age- and dementia-friendly communities are needed to push the narrative forward (van Hoof & Marston, 2021). There is a specific need when developing age-friendly communities to include the perspectives of older adults living with and without dementia (Brorsson, 2013; Gaber, 2020; van Hoof & Marston, 2021).Two tools to better understand age- and dementia-friendly communities, including technological considerations, include the Participation in ACTivities and Places OUTside Home Questionnaire (ACT-OUT; Margot-Cattin et al., 2019) and the Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire (ETUQ; Nygrd et al., 2016). The ACT-OUT Questionnaire aims to capture detailed information on places and activities in combination, specifically identifying participation restrictions and pointing out barriers and facilitators in different contexts (Margot-Cattin et al., 2019). The ETUQ assesses the participants perceived ability and relevance using more than 90 everyday technologies (Nygrd et al., 2016).The ACT-OUT Questionnaire and the ETUQ have been used to educate students (e.g., occupational therapy and other healthcare students), clinicians, service providers, designers, and the public about the need to consider cognitive accessibility when designing public space, for example through a short film (https://vimeo.com/362114355).More recently, a cross-national study (Gaber et al., 2022) using the ACT-OUT showed that both diagnosis of dementia and country of residence had significant effects on levels of participation in activities and places in public space and thus, opportunities to enact social citizenship. Older adults living with dementia participated in significantly fewer activities and places than those without dementia. Participation was significantly lower among older adults living with dementia in the following 10 types of places:mall, supermarketdentists officesmall storesenior center, social clubpharmacyentertainment, cultural placebank, post officeforest, mountain, lake, seadoctors officesports facilityThese community locations map a starting point to focus development of targeted supports and programs, policies, and built environments to support older adults to enact their social citizenship (Gaber et al., 2022).ConclusionHuman-built technologies, in the form of public spaces, places, and tools, directly but subtly shape the kinds of habits, routines, places for living, and experiences of older adults in ways that are not yet fully recognized or addressed in design. Thus, possibilities for a better future for aging remain challenging. This article proposes moving toward a strengths-based view of aging that recognizes older adults can enact their social citizenship through participation in activities and places in the public space they perceive as being culturally, personally, and socially meaningful. This requires a greater consideration of cognitive aspects of accessibility to reconcile the corporeal-cerebral dichotomies that have influenced biomedical approaches to healthcare, design, and service delivery. As a starting point, we call for increased involvement of older adults living with and without dementia in the design and development of human-built technologies, targeting those 10 places as well as everyday technologies that are perceived as particularly challenging.Sophie Gaber, PhD, MSc, Reg OT, is an occupational therapist and postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Healthcare Sciences at Marie Cederschild University, in Stockholm, Sweden.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2023The Gendered Nature of Age WarsBy Susan PickardOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureAbstract:This article explores the gendered dimension of age wars narratives in the media. It traces the symbolic role played by older women in these representations of generational inequity, stemming from old tropes and images associated with the struggle for selfhood that lie at the heart of psychosocial development. It suggests this age-wars theme is pronounced in a younger generation that desperately fears aging yet struggles to fully grow up. But such modern mythmaking is harmful, shaping societal perceptions of older women that underpin inequality and disadvantage, suggesting the urgent need for the circulation of counter-myths and stories of generational cooperation and solidarity.Key Words:age wars, sexism, ageism, generations, third age, fourth ageAs a professor of sociology at the University of Liverpool, I direct the Centre for Ageing and the Life Course. For the past decade my research has focused on the intersections between gender, age, and well-being, theoretically and empirically. Recent research includes ongoing funded projects on frailty and ethnicity, and on menopause and ethnicity, as well as theoretical studies of the interplay between age theory and gender theory.Visual and narrative representations of old age in North American, European, and U.K. media, for the main part, are divided into two main categories, one associated with the third age and one with the fourth. Broadly speaking, the third age is the aspirational category, associated with successful aging, health, and wealth. By contrast, the fourth age is associated with undesirable qualitiesill health, senescence, and dependence.One factor the representations share is that they are often gendered. It is the privileged older woman depicted enjoying an exotic holiday or other expensive leisure activity who stands for the third age, contrasted with the frail, bent-backed old lady hunched over her walker in ankle socks and an old-fashioned frock representing the fourth age. Increasingly, in media depictions of the age waror intergenerational strife (an increasingly popular trope through which to discuss social issues/problems)both the third and fourth ages are targets for charges of generational inequity.In some cases, there are specific grievances directed at one or another category; in other cases, no distinction is made between them, and it is the old who, in multiple ways, are depicted as oppressors of the young (Toynbee, 2023). Again, it is the figure of the older woman who becomes, in multifaceted ways, the symbol of generational unfairness, though one also is struck by the frequent presence of young women representing youth who are angry at injustice.While this is not a new phenomenonthere are deep structures to such representations including in myth and fairy tale, which problematize gendered old age as the threatening Otherthe particular forms this phenomenon takes today suggest a powerful combination of ageism and misogyny associated with a number of social trends. For example, there is a fierce split between two generations of feminists, with the older generation characterized as Karens by Generation Z (Stern, 2019) and the younger as snowflakes, in ways that obscure ongoing intergenerational solidarities (Bindel, 2021; Smith, 2023). At the same time, young women have become symbolic of the promise of neoliberalism, epitomizing the entrepreneurial subject who works continually on self-improvement, and are posited as key to the economic success of the West (Gill, 2007; Scharff, 2016).In this piece I will explore the gendered nature of the age war and consider why it occurs. I will draw upon a variety of diverse frameworks to explore how we talk about older women, gender, and aging, including feminist theory, (feminist) psychoanalytic theory, and cultural and media studies. I will ask: why are older women associated with generational unfairness? How, and through what themes and imagery, is this expressed in popular discourse and representations? The final section will explore the possibility of resisting this harmful trend.Old Age: The Third Age, the Fourth Age, and Their Representational RegimesThe concepts of the third and the fourth ages were introduced into the English-speaking world by Peter Laslett (1987). Lasletts specific focus was on the third age, his aim being to redeem and reconceptualize old age by decoupling it from outdated connotations of sickness, poverty, and dependency. The third age developed in the cultural imagination in part via articles in the news and popular media in the three decades that have followed, with an increasing association with activity, entrepreneurship, and opportunities for self-development (Shimoni, 2018).Meanwhile, the fourth age has been developed in ever more negative terms, a repository for all the aspects devalued when emphasizing the youthful self. In line with this negativity, medical categories, including frailty, developed at the same time, signaling the entry-point to the fourth age (Gilleard & Higgs, 2011a).Privilege sometimes indicates wealth or social capital and sometimes suggests a generation taking more of its fair share of societal goods.At the same time, a trend toward anti-aging and turning back the clock has developed in parallel. This is important in understanding the degree to which youthfulness is prized. While High Street pharmacy chains now offer Botox and cosmetic surgery is enjoying a boom (Wilson, 2023), the most radical approach, available only to the super-rich, is that of attempting to stop or reverse aging altogether. As many women have commented, the availability of technologies to modify aging appearance increases the pressure to use them Such cultural attitudes suggest that the gap between the perceived desirability of youth and old age is increasing (berg et al., 2020).Although there is a long history of problematizing old age in arguments about social inequality, which precedes the third/fourth age division, the dominant theme in older arguments has concerned the perceived burden placed by old age on the (younger) population. However, the trope of the privileged older person has reasserted itself in media representations with remarkable vengeance, especially in the U.K. since 2008, where it has emerged in news coverage of issues such as austerity following the financial crisis, Brexit, the election of a Conservative government, COVID, and the cost-of-living crisis that followed the pandemics end (Pickard, 2019).These two formulations of anti-aging biasolder adults as a burden, and older adults as unfairly privilegednow proceed in parallel and occasionally merge, with privilege sometimes indicating wealth or social capital, and sometimes suggesting a generation taking more than its fair share of societal goods of any kind, including welfare.The Gendered Dimension of Age WarsWhat is notable, yet rarely remarked upon, is the gendered dimension of this depiction (Pickard, 2019). Both depictionswhether of old age as a burden or as privilegedare frequently illustrated in international news media by photographic images and discourses featuring older women. These comprise seemingly patriotic older women with bunting and symbols of empire such as the Union Jack and the Jubilee; older women enjoying the privileges of wealth (yachting trips, snorkeling in tropical waters, and other examples of carefree, expensive leisure); as well as older women in need of care, backs bent over walkers. These images are often juxtaposed with those of younger women, frequently presented as protesting in large groups about generational injustice. One example is that of a young woman holding a banner proclaiming: Youll die of old age, well die of climate change (Shafik, 2021).On the one hand, these articles proclaim that third agers have taken too much from the economy, leaving nothing for the young, a view put forward in an article inThe Times. The article makes an argument about intergenerational inequality by counterposing Caroline, in the privileged position, and her daughter Sadie, who is young and oppressed (Duncan, 2023).Called The OK Boomerwhen privilege gets dangerous, nearly all of the accompanying photographs illustrating this privilege are of older women, including the ubiquitous figure of Margaret Thatcher. Caroline is a rentier capitalist, according to journalist Emma Duncan, not because she is a member of the super-wealthy leisured class, but because she has paid off her mortgage after 42 years of work and can now afford to go on nice holidays.Twenty-six-year-old Sadie says, Theyve taken all the property and the money and left us with all the debts. Who they refers to is unclear as the article also documents Caroline pledging to sell the house and give half the equity to her children now. (To be clear, it is not the merits of these arguments I am debating here, but rather the manner and tropes through which they are fashioned.)On the other hand, poor, vulnerable old women are also dangerous because of their need for healthcare and pensions. Images illustrating these articles can evoke pity, for example the image accompanying an article headlined UK elderly suffer worst poverty rates in western Europe (Doward, 2019) is of an old woman placing a penny carefully into a cloth purse, suggesting the need to, literally, count every penny. However, the subtext suggests that such neediness swallows up resources that would otherwise be directed at younger generations and is thus every bit as threatening as greed and rapaciousness.What makes older women symbolic of generational inequity? Is it ageism, sexism, or a toxic combination of both?In reportage in 202021 in relation to care homes and the COVID-19 pandemic, and in photographic images accompanying newspaper articles from as far apart as theDaily Mail,The New York Times, andThe Guardian, the figure of a fourth-age old woman, rather than an old man, recurs strikingly. Study supports that older women do not decrease in competence in the eyes of younger adults based on the acceptance of help, whereas older men do (Sublett et al., 2022). Of course, it is also more culturally acceptable for older women to acknowledge their vulnerability and accept the help and care of others.If feminine age is a problem, by contrast, COVID had a hero in the form of an old man. Captain Tom Moore was a 99-year-old man who, though frail and reliant on a walker for mobility, nevertheless pledged to complete 100 laps of his garden before reaching his 100th birthday, raising more than 1 million in the first year for the National Health Service (Carney et al., 2022). His achievement was celebrated with a knighthood given to him by Queen Elizabeth II, in July 2020. Though vulnerable, he continued to exhibit agency, strength, and productivity, which distanced him from the feminine aging associated with the fourth age and its risks.What Accounts for Cultural Aversion to Older Women?What are the reasons for this combination of visual and narrative ageism and misogyny that makes older women symbolic of generational inequity? Is it ageism, sexism, or a toxic combination of both? Feminist literature, gerontological or otherwise, has often looked at such issues through the lens of double jeopardy/marginalization/oppression, in which intersections add to the individual disadvantages to become something qualitatively different. However, intersectionality has little to say about the complex and contradictory associations we are discussing here, including their deep symbolic and emotional resonances.To explain the generational ageism and misogyny, we need a different starting point conceptually, and Freuds model of gendered development in childhood is a good place to star as it offers a more sophisticated explanation of the origins of these antagonisms. Here the break with the father and the break with the mother are portrayed as very different psychic events. Whether in terms of the primal horde or the family drama, the sons battle with the father is a clean, swift struggle to take or assume power. The separation with the mother is of a different order. For boys, it takes the form of a robust rejection of femininity, the silent enemy that can undermine a mans masculinity throughout his life and establish an enduring misogyny (Chodorow, 1978; Dinnerstein, 1976).For girls, separation with the mother is prolonged and messy; not a struggle but a slow detachment, potentially never completed. Contemporary conditions, as compared to the time when Freud wrote, impede that separation further for many young people. Against the backdrop of societal changes, including an extended education and expensive housing leading to a delay in establishing themselves as independent adults, dependency on the mothers care, emotional and financial, can stretch well into ones 30s.Furthermore, in the context of ongoing gender pay gaps and unequal domestic work and childcare provision, daughters may feel that their mothers generation has failed to realize the goals of feminism, thereby letting them down (Smith, 2023). We thus have the push-pull of repulsion and attraction, the need for separation with an ongoing, stuttering dependency.This psychosocial push-pull, however, has deep roots that can shed a little more light on this paradox. It is depicted in the archetype which Jungian scholars have termed the Great Mother, orMagna Mater. Represented in statues, paintings, and other images found across the world and through the ages, Jungian scholar Erich Neumann (2015) saw this figure as representing the struggle for individuation described above.She comprises two aspects: the Good Mother and the Terrible Mother, which are intertwined (Neumann, 2015). The Good Mother, nurturing, selfless, to be consumed by her offspring, can also become the Terrible Mother, refusing to let go and thus blocking individuation. Meanwhile, the Terrible Motherdestructive, taking back what she givescan become the Good Mother by encouraging transformation to a more mature consciousnessthroughstruggle (Neumann, 2015), displaying a complex and oscillatory dynamic.At the same time, the good and terrible aspects are fundamentally combined, especially through the principle of generativity: the inseparability of the cyclical nature of birth and decay, suggesting that what is given in birth and prized in youth is taken back in senescence and death. Magna Mater is thus a deeply uncomfortable reminder of our own mortality, our own co-existence with the cyclical processes of the animal and vegetable worlds.The figure of the older woman thus comes with a heavy weight of cultural baggage. These, to be clear are not actual women, but myths of womanhood and the feminine, as Simone de Beauvoir (1949/1997) described inThe Second Sex, portraying not a reality but rather aconceptionof womanhood from the male perspective and against which women have to struggle in their lived experience at every stage of their life.A similar distancing effect from old age can be achieved by means of the presence of old women in literature and movies who are killed or defeated.In her magnum opus, de Beauvoir outlines the link between the processes of Othering the female sex and old age, respectively, and interprets these myths as suggesting that to a large degree the Otherness of old age (in patriarchal society) derives from, and is an intrinsic part of, the alterity of the feminine.These myths tell us: Women weave human destiny; but they also cut the threads (de Beauvoir, 1949/1997, 170). And again: What man thus cherishes and detests first in woman, lover as well as mother, is the fixed image of her animal destiny, the life essential to her existence, but that condemns her to finitude and death. From the day of birth, man begins to die: this is the truth that the mother embodies (de Beauvoir, 1949/1997, 188).This oscillating movement is also captured by the concept ofabjection. As extrapolated by feminist psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva (1982), this captures the need, in infancy, to expel the Otheror the body of the motherin order for the self to be fully formed. But the Other is never fully expelled and hovers henceforth as a threat and temptation. Abjection also is associated with a cultural response to the fourth age (Gilleard & Higgs, 2011b), expressing a desire to keep ones distance from the unwelcome changes associated with senescence, even while the latter haunts our pursuit of eternal youthfulness.One way to hold abjection at bay is to turn ones body into a citadel resisting change. An example of this is provided by the tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson. Age 45, he employs a team of 30 healthcare experts committed to reversing the aging process in each of his organs. Led by regenerative medicine physician Oliver Zolman, the team devises a strict dietary, exercise, and sleep regimen to which Johnson must adhere, combined with dozens of monthly medical procedures aimed at improving the function and condition of his organs and tests to check for progress. Johnson explains, This really is an impassioned approach to achieve age 18 everywhere (Vance, 2013).A similar distancing effect from old age can be achieved by means of the presence of old women in literature and movies who are killed or defeated. We are all familiar with the trope of the bitter, twisted old woman, such as Miss Havisham, Baby Jane, and Norma Desmond, and there has emerged an increasingly popular genre of hagsploitation movies (Billson, 2018).Barbara Creed (1993) identified two distinct but interlocking threads in these representations, comprising woman-as-monster and woman-as-victim, evil and pitiful, bad and good. Both are equally threatening; both are framed within the male perspective. Creed observed that the horror film serves as catharsis, as a form of ritual expulsion, when defeating the monster allows the audience to reaffirm the boundaries of the self.One nuanced contemporary example is the aging matriarch, Violet, ofAugust: Osage County(Wells, 2013). Violet resembles a monster both through her wild and disheveled appearance and in her disruptive behavior at her late husbands funeral. But she also is both victim and heroine, revealing long-buried secrets concerning her husbands character (for example, he fathered a child with Violets sister), thus shattering his image as benevolent patriarch. She attempts to reveal truth regarding the double-standard of aging to her three daughters who are approaching midlife, as if to provoke them into understanding that while the family patriarch is dead, the patriarchy is thriving. Their own aging, she seems to tell them, will show them the rottenness at the heart of the sexual economy.But Violets daughters do not want to hear this: they remain loyal to their menfolk and their main fear is that they will turn into women like Violet. As Victoria Smith (2023) has observed in her book on the vilification of middle-age women, critiques that older women are well placed to make against patriarchy, the gender hierarchy, and the sexual economy are dismissed by younger generations because they are no longer part of the sexual economy. Because of their age they are depicted not as enlightened but as bitter and jealous. Meanwhile, such an alliance between younger women and men against older women (whether or not the former claim to be on the side of progress) works to the benefit of patriarchal power.Discussion and Concluding ThoughtsIn this piece, I have identified some deep structures and myths in the cultural imagination that link (feminine) gender/womanhood and old age in a way that makes them the Other to the masculine self of late modernity. This alterity is associated with the need to separate from the mother and maps perfectly onto the so-called generational divide that is a popular cultural theme with a younger generation that desperately fears aging yet struggles to grow up. But, to paraphrase Lester and Ross (2003), both pictures and text can injure (Loos & Ivan, 2018) and not just reflect but also create and exacerbate antagonisms. These representations of older women are modern versions of much older myths and, as de Beauvoir noted, are more impactful than laws on the cultural imagination. The harmful elements of these discourses directly underpin the material disadvantages that affect older women more than older men, including the lack of opportunities in the workplace and the diminished social capital that comes with age.These myths also help to obscure the huge intragenerational differences between older people, as well as the deep bonds of sympathy and solidarity they share with younger people (e.g., Duffy, 2021). Stories of generational harmony, along with sympathetic images of older women (neither greedy nor pitiful) reflecting diverse lives and situations are thus important countermyths. Likewise, any attempts, including frequent readers letters to news media, that challenge and deconstruct these stories (Cohen, 2002), to demonstrate the link between ageism and misogyny and advocate for different portrayals of older women and their value to society serve as key elements in alternative stories.Susan Pickard, PhD, heads the Department of Sociology, Social Policy and Criminology at the University of Liverpool, in the U.K. She may be contacted atsusan.pickard@liverpool.ac.uk.Photo credit: Shutterstock/PattyPhotoReferencesberg, E., Kukkonen, I., & Sarpila, O.

KobayashiOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstractA social epidemiologic approach to health and aging provides a specific language for conceptualizing, investigating, and contributing novel understandings of the nature of aging. The integration of creative counterfactual thinking through a causal lens, life-course models, and cross-national comparisons allows social epidemiologists to critically examine the determinants of health and illness across diverse global contexts. These tools provide a foundation from which empirical evidence can be generated to reimagine what aging could look like in the future, under various revisions of global and local social structures around the world.Key Words:social epidemiology, life course, causal inference, counterfactuals, comparative research, health equityBodies tell stories that voices cannot. Aging bodies tell stories of accumulation; of years spent in struggle, with freedom, with plenty, with little, with kinship, in isolation, and with joy and sadness. It is in later-lifehowever we define this phasethat the totality of ones experiences become physically inscribed in health status. Health, or lack thereof, is the ultimate expression of social inequality.Epidemiology is the study of the distribution of health and disease in populations (Susser, 1973), and social epidemiology is a subfield of epidemiology. Social epidemiologists study the ways in which societies are organized to produce or impede population health (Berkman & Kawachi, 2014). Through its integration of sociological theory with mathematical approaches to causal effect estimation, social epidemiology provides a language for conceptualizing, discovering, and determining the universalities and local diversities in health and aging.Social epidemiologists use data to tell stories of bodies that people cannot tell with their voices, whether because they lack the opportunity or platform to tell their stories, because they are forbidden from telling their stories, or because they lack the words with which to tell their stories. As with many other academic disciplines, social epidemiologists hold a precious form of power in their ability to use data to tell stories. The language with which we choose to tell these stories has real consequences for the perceptions, policies, and actions that will shape the futures of aging bodies to come.Within and beyond social epidemiology, a predominant conceptualization of aging is that of decline, one that frames conversations around inevitable losses. Aging brings about increased health risks, including chronic diseases, in addition to declines in physical and cognitive function, all of which can lead to frailty, dependence, and loss of quality of life.Theoretical models of successful aging and healthy aging implicitly retain this focus as they emphasize successful aging or healthy aging despite the inherent risks of getting older. But social epidemiology gives us tools with which to recognize nuanced heterogeneities in aging within and across societies, allowing a reframing of the narrative around aging and an uncovering of the realities of aging, from global to hyper-local scales.A global perspective necessitates encapsulating global geographies and interconnections in society, and understanding universal commonalities that drive social processes and often lead to vast disparities (Finn, 2023). We also can use a global perspective when referring to human universalities, such as the need for food, water, shelter, companionship, love, dignity, and a sense of purpose.A hyper-local perspective can add nuance, by telling us more about the day-to-day living conditions in which these needs are fulfilled or denied, providing contextually specific data to inform appropriate intervention and prevention strategies. Finally, a consideration of how experiences accumulate over time tells us the stories of aging bodies, and social epidemiologic data gives us the language and power to tell these stories.This article discusses how social epidemiology provides a language for conceptualizing, discovering, and determining the universalities and local diversities in health and aging. Three main approaches are discussed: the use of a life-course approach, the practice of causal inference using quantitative data, and the creative leveraging around the world of cross-national comparisons to identify variations in risks and protective factors for health during aging. The article ends by summarizing how these approaches can contribute to reframing narratives about how people age around the world.Social Epidemiologists, Aging, and the Life CourseSocial epidemiologists use a life-course approach to conceptualize and investigate the stories of bodies, especially of aging bodies. While life-course theory originated in sociology, epidemiologists have refined it to include considering disease development and latency periods, approaches to causal effect estimation, and the integration of novel methodologies (Mayeda et al., 2021). Understanding the complexities of health and illness during aging requires a life-course approach, as risks for chronic health conditions such as cancers, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimers disease and related dementias are understood to accumulate over time and express in clinically recognizable symptoms following long latency periods. The popular phrase the long arm of childhood was coined by demographers Mark Hayward and Brigid Gorman (2004) in a study of the relationship between early childhood social conditions and mens mortality in the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men in the United States.What would the world have looked like if we rolled back the clock and altered some aspect of reality?In social epidemiology, and in epidemiology more broadly, applying a life-course approach largely involves crafting ones research question as informed by a life-course theoretical model (Mayeda et al., 2021). A thoughtful application of the life-course approach requires knowledge of the pathophysiologic process underlying the chronic disease of interest so that appropriate life-course periods of exposure can be identified for investigation, as well as the appropriate induction period, which is the time elapsed between exposure and disease onset.For example, a social epidemiologist using a life-course approach might ask, Do the effects of exposure to air pollution on the risk of dementia depend on the timing and duration across the life course during which air pollution exposure is experienced? They may then examine different types, sources, and concentrations of air pollution exposure at different times and durations across the life course, as informed by empirical evidence or theory on the biological effects of air pollution on the brain. Life-course approaches to health and aging in social epidemiology invite us to ask empirical questions with improved theoretical and empirical rigor and appropriate temporality between exposures and outcomes, all of which supports the validity of effect estimation and ultimately the planning of effective interventions to support health during aging.The Role of Data in the Storytelling of Bodies: Association Is Not CausationA key goal of social epidemiology is to understand the causes of health and disease to inform effective interventional strategies that promote population health and health equity. To achieve this goal, social epidemiologists must perform causal inference, the process of determining whether a causal relationship exists between an exposure (say, air pollution) and a subsequent health outcome (say, later-life dementia). Causal inference is not unique to epidemiology; many disciplines share a rich philosophy and history of theoretical frameworks and applications of causal inference (Imbens & Rubin, 2015; Rothman & Greenland, 2005; Sobel, 1996). Many academics across quantitative science disciplines are familiar with the phrases association is not causation and absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, which allude to some challenges inherent in the practice of causal inference.Despite these challenges, causal thinking in social epidemiology invites us to imagine counterfactualswhat would the world have looked like if we rolled back the clock and altered some aspect of reality to see what would have happened in this alternative, counterfactual timeline?When thinking about health and aging, causal thinking invites us to ask what would have happened to the distribution of health and illness in this population, in this place, at this time, had historical exposures occurred in a different way, counter to reality?In the air pollution example, the use of counterfactual thinking combined with a life-course approach would encourage us to frame our research question in terms of the potential population distribution of dementia outcomes that would have been observed, had the subset of individuals classified as exposed to air pollution been, counter to fact, not exposed. The definition of air pollution exposure and the study design used to answer this question would be selected to test hypotheses about different types and sources of air pollution experienced at different life-course stages in relation to later-life dementia risk, as informed by theory or empirical evidence of the pathophysiological effects of air pollution exposure on the brain.The clear conceptual and mathematical definitions of counterfactuals are a cornerstone of causal effect estimation in epidemiology. Forcing ourselves to imagine and articulate a counterfactual world when estimating the effect of an exposure on a health outcome is a creative exercise in which we consider how things might have been under a different exposure scenario, whether that exposure scenario is on a micro or a macro scale.We find one of the strongest clues that counterfactual worlds in which humans achieve longer and healthier lives are possible in global life expectancy data. Life expectancy is a useful indicator of the overall well-being of a population. Around the globe, as of 2020, life expectancy at birth ranged from 53 years (Chad) to 85 years (Hong Kong, Macao, and Japan; World Bank, 2022).Life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to infant mortality rates, such that other informative metrics, especially when thinking about older populations, are remaining life expectancies at age 50 or at age 65. The existence of wide variation in life expectancies around the world tells us that they have the potential to be lengthened, pushing us to ponder the counterfactual social, economic, and political conditions under which longer life expectancies could be achieved.Of course, life is worth little without quality of life, and it will take a substantial restructuring of the conditions under which people age for populations to live not only longer, but also healthier lives. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent declines in life expectancy in several countries prompt us to examine how national responses to the pandemic, not only in terms of public health control measures but also changes to political institutions, social protection policies, and the social fabrics of societies have impacted the health and well-being of populations (Finn & Kobayashi, 2020).Cross-national Comparisons Can Uncover Global Universalities and Local Diversities in AgingThe social epidemiologist Geoffrey Roses (2001) seminal work Sick Individuals and Sick Populations articulates how the drivers of differences in health outcomes between individuals may not be the same as the drivers of differences in health outcomes between populations. The causes of ill health may be masked on the individual level if they are homogeneously distributed within a given population. Roses example is that of the distribution of systolic blood pressure among middle-age men in two populations: Kenyan nomads, and London civil servants. Rose explained that while an analysis of the determinants of high blood pressure within either population alone may help to identify individual-level drivers of high blood pressureanswering the question, Why do some individuals have higher blood pressure than others?such an analysis would miss the more important public health question, Why is hypertension absent in the Kenyans, and common in London?The causes of ill health may be masked on the individual level if they are homogeneously distributed within a given population.To answer the latter question, Rose (2001) proposed we need to study the characteristics of populations, rather than the characteristics of individuals. Zooming out to the scale of countries, to think not just aboutindividual bodiesbut about thebody politicat large, allows us to identify population-level levers that may be pulled to alter the macro-level contexts shaping health and disease risk.Cross-national or cross-population comparisons are a valuable yet under-utilized tool for social epidemiologists to identify population-level drivers of the prevalence and incidence of health conditions. When integrated with a life-course approach to health and aging and a careful consideration of the conditions necessary for causal effect estimation, cross-national comparisons can be powerful for identifying sources of variation in the health of older populations.The 2020 Lancet Commission on Dementia concluded that 2.3% of all dementia cases were attributable to air pollution exposure, yet the evidence upon which this conclusion was based came from a single cohort study in Canada, a country with some of the lowest air pollution levels in the world (Livingston et al., 2020). A social epidemiologic approach that leverages cross-national data, drawing from Rose, could provide a more comprehensive picture of this potential dementia risk factor that better represents the real living conditions of people who experience air pollution exposure. Exposure to air pollution is dependent upon many factors, namely physical proximity to a range of sources such as indoor open flame cooking, outdoor fires, road traffic, and agricultural or industrial production.While the study of health effects of air pollution is often overlooked by social epidemiologists, exposure and susceptibility to air pollution are linked to poverty and social marginalization and are thus highly inequitable within and across societies (Hajat et al., 2015). Further, the long-term health effects of air pollution exposure may only express themselves in later-life, in health conditions such as chronic respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and dementia risk, necessitating a life-course approach.A study of air pollution and dementia risk in the United States may conclude that only certain sources of emission prevalent in the United States are linked with later-life dementia risk, and that physical residential proximity to these emission sources is inequitably distributed across racial and ethnic groups and by socioeconomic position (Gonzalez et al., 2023). A restricted geographic scope of study limited to the United States or other high-income nations may also conclude that air pollution contributes to a relatively small share of dementia cases, given the prevalence of exposure in these settings. In contrast, studies of air pollution and dementia risk in many low- and middle-income countries would likely expand their focus to include the indoor combustion of household fuels for cooking, lighting, and heating, as well as open waste burning.The nature of air pollution exposure around the world is variable and likely different from that of the experience of high-income older populations that are represented in current dementia evidence. This is a major inequity in the dementia evidence base that limits policy to support the healthy aging of populations worldwide, which social epidemiologists are well-poised to address.Another bit of language social epidemiologists contribute to how we can think and talk about aging is consistency of cause. Differences in air pollution as a health risk exposure across global contexts can be seen as a violation of the consistency assumption of causal inference in epidemiology. The consistency assumption is the idea that there should be only one version of the exposure, and if any aspects of the exposure vary between individuals, they must be ignorable with respect to differences in their effects on a given outcome (Cole & Frangakis, 2009). In other words, different exposures require the estimation of different causal contrasts, and these exposure-specific contrasts should map onto hypothetical interventions that could be designed in the future.While air pollution is a broad enough descriptor that any reasonable study of its health effects would need to be as specific as possible about the type and source of the pollutant(s) of interest, it can be difficult to ascertain the origins of airborne particulate matter and measures of ambient particulate matter in different contexts. Measures of fine particulate matter taken in the streets of urban Delhi, the surrounds of the Agbogbloshie electronic devices toxic waste site in Accra, in suburban areas near petrochemical sites in Texas, or following wildfires after periods of extreme heat may capture the same molecules but in different combinations and concentrations, from different sources, and with different health implications.Social epidemiologists are aware of consistency assumption violations with respect to social exposures such as education or income.Social epidemiologists are aware of consistency assumption violations with respect to social exposures such as education or income (Rehkopf et al., 2016). Rather than abandoning a research topic due to consistency violations, social epidemiologists can creatively leverage consistency violations to use empirical data to identify and learn from heterogeneities in risk and protective factors for health during aging across diverse global contexts.A related concept that allows social epidemiologists to identify variations in risk and resilience to health outcomes during aging across contexts from national to local scales is that of effect modification. Effect modification occurs when the effect of a risk factor on a given health outcome differs across population subgroups, usually due to a third factor or attribute held or experienced by that subgroup that confers additional susceptibility or resilience to that risk factor. While air pollution is a risk factor for dementia, identifying certain population subgroups or regions in which older adults appear to be resilient to the impacts of air pollution on dementia risk would be informative for designing policies to protect other populations.Such investigation of effect modification would additionally contribute to the reframing of predominant narratives about inevitabilities of risk associated with aging. Effect modification in the case of the air pollutiondementia example could be any form of risk mitigation system that dulls the impact of exposure, such as air filtration or masking, or even a certain genetic polymorphism that blunts the exposures biological effect. Careful investigation of effect modification allows social epidemiologists to uncover diversities in aging at local scales.ConclusionA key goal of social epidemiology is to understand the causes of health and disease to inform effective interventions that promote population health and health equity. The integration of creative counterfactual thinking with life-course models and in a cross-national comparison framework allows social epidemiologists to critically examine the determinants of health and illness across diverse global contexts. These tools provide a language for describing global universalities and local diversities in health and aging, as they have the potential to illuminate where, when, and under what circumstances aging-related health outcomes may be malleable through intervention.Hence, social epidemiologists can help us to re-imagine what aging could look like in the future under alternative population distributions of risk and protective factors for health, and alternative organizations of societies that structure such exposure distributions for their populations. It is up to social epidemiologistsand other quantitative population health science researchersto use their linguistic tools responsibly to help improve the health of older adults worldwide and address global issues of health equity among the most marginalized older adults.Lindsay C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2023How We Talk About AgingBy Mark LuborskyOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:How far have we come from our ancestors in the way we now speak of aging, and where might we be headed? This journal issue provides examples pointing readers to the many ways to recognize the forms in and levels from which we talk about aging. Each articles topics addresses a different way talk about aging surrounds us and shapes the life and experiences of old age.Key words:aging, narrative, paradigms, diversity, designWe have come a long way since the early part of the 19th century in our capacity to talk meaningfully about aging. Scholars working to determine a systematic count of older persons earlier in history found it is not simply a matter of enumerating older individuals from historical records. Those records embody ideas about who counts as a case of the older person that persists in contemporary societal stereotypes.During the 19th century, one of the earliest population censuses featured one category that lumped together a diverse set of people and situations, composed of persons who were either poor, aged, infirm, or disabled, as described by an early gerontologist Jill Quadagno (1982).This census category challenged her efforts to construct a demographic profile of older adults living in early industrial society in England, which she used to help debunk presuppositions that problems of old-age dependency did not exist in the 19th century because family provided such care. Social policy developed in that era, voiced in the legislative idiom of Poor Laws, created a centralized bureaucratic system for societal support to people based upon personal poverty.Recognition of older persons as a separate category from the poor evolved later in that era when pensions emerged in policies designed to allocate resources solely based upon old age. This category expressed the societal-level value of collective accountability and responsibility for elder care beyond that resting on an individuals family or locality. We are still on the long road to devising adequate policies that account for the national-level impact of growing numbers of older adults and ensuring socially and personally meaningful later life for everyone.One ambition for thisGenerations Journalissue is to provide examples pointing readers to ways to recognize the multitude of forms in and levels at which we talk about aging. The hope is that increasing recognition of the varieties of ways in which we talk about aging can help illuminate fresh opportunities to advance knowledge about aging, how it is lived, and strategies for building more just futures for later life.This journal issue is deeply grounded in a comparative perspective that seeks commonalities and differences in aging across levels of life from the vantage of cross-cultural, cross-national, intergenerational, and individual differences. We can learn from a global, cross-cultural view of alternative solutions for organizing human society, plans and meanings for life, and responses to change, as well as from exploring diversities in how individuals envision and construct their life biographies. The utility of this perspective is evoked by the adage Laboratories of democracy for the American system of individual states, attributed to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis (1932). He drew attention to the strengths of granting states the capacity to experiment and devise practices and social and economic solutions to pressing issues independently, without risk to the rest of the country. In this fashion, various strategies may arise to benefit all later.What Comprises the Salient Case of Aging?One takeaway for readers is analytic. It should engender a greater curiosity about our commonsense notions of who and what is salient to include in considerations of aging and where aging occurs. By that, I mean continuing to question what is the most valid, salient unit of social and personal experience required to advance our understanding of aging and the relevant issues. What is the case we define as aging, and what are the nature and variety of forms of narrative in stories of aging?Consider how we define the elements that make up the case (Ragin & Becker, 1992) of aging. A paradigm shift has occurred. Until recently, aging was narrowly conceived of using the individual as the basic unit for study and site of interventions. Our obsolete historical legacy conceived of aging mainly in the body, defined chronologically by the passing of calendar days, on a single undifferentiated path where it is natural to lose capabilities and health and become passive and isolated.We are still on the long road to devising adequate policies that account for the national-level impact of growing numbers of older adults.Today, to understand the relevant aging unit, we conceive of it as the complex product of intersections of biological, sociocultural, economic, historical, and local contexts and processes. Illustrations include initiatives targeted at the level of urban design to create dementia-friendly cityscapes in Bruges, Belgium, and Washington, DC. We now conceptualize aging in terms of lives lived through a diversity of times and places in concert with others (people and contexts), a composition of larger societal life-course scripts that provide life meanings played out across a score of world events, opportunities, and constraints. This perspective incorporates intersectionality at higher levels of analyses than the narrower boundary-driven sciences of the past, and by doing so, opens fresh new avenues to change societal-level designs for living in later life, the treatment of older adults, and societal structures to reduce ageist structural violence.Other significant expansions to our lens on the case of aging include newly recognized assemblages of connectedness, rather than the individual body, localized brain centers, or the individual. These wider lenses, or levels of analyses, now include the brain connectome, the neural network of individual brain regions, gut biome interactions with brain function, social contagion of depression and well-being, to the human-built environment that can be dementia-inclusive and friendly rather than impediments.Thus, today, the focus of discovery and interventions indexes not just services to individuals but also integrates contexts including interpersonal, economic, policy, and human-made environments. At each level, gerontologists and others are working to define relevant phenomena and events and assemble them into patterned relationships to create meaningful accountsnew notions of narratives about and for aging. These narratives are explicit and highly visible (as scientific paradigms, cultural traditions, and popular stereotypes), implicit deeper (assumptions), and emerging. As narratives, they provide a particular script, present tensions and dilemmas, and explanations for life. Such narrative modes of reasoning are a focus of this issue of Generations Journal.Sticks and Stones Will Break My Bones, But Words Will Never Harm MePerhaps the most readily familiar way to think about how we talk about aging is in terms of the linguistic vocabulary of words. How we talk about older people is becoming more socially regulated with shifts in what are publicly acceptable terms. We have moved from the era of sticks and stones will break my bones (Christian Recorder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, 1862) to a deep appreciation of the tangible suffering from pejorative stereotypes and verbal abuse. For example, the elderly or aged as a master identity has come to be displaced with inclusive neutral terms such as older people to foster broader notions of age as only one feature of the whole complex person rather than the only feature. Yet, interestingly, in ageist styles of talking to older persons, elder speak persists (Shaw & Gordon, 2021), observable in the use of singsong tones, simplifications, and repeating in ways similar to baby talk, evoking a paternalism and infantilization of the older person. In these ways, vestiges persist from those early associations with infirmity in daily interactions with older persons.Analysis of 25,000 movie dialogues from across the globe showed how popular media speaks about older adults negatively across all regions (Ng, Indran, & Wang, 2023). Ageist discourses stigmatize older persons in care contexts and those who care for them (Manchha, 2023).The word stew of ageist terms and stereotypes that encode demeaning microaggressions remains a worthy focus of policy, study, and social action. The need for change is heightened given what we now know about the corrosive health and well-being effects of denigration and isolation due to systemic institutional and daily stigma experiences. Hopefully, progress toward more equitable lives for people in later life will continue to improve, whether due to the raw pressure of sheer numbers of older adults or the growing anti-ageism policies and socially progressive movements such as age-friendly university initiatives and advocacy groups for the environment (Pillemer, 2017) led by older persons themselves.Understanding Continuity and Change Through Narrative IdiomsNarratives come in several flavors and sizeslarger and smaller scale ones. There are grand sweeping master narratives (e.g., Successful vs. Productive Aging, Manifest Destiny, Black Lives Matter) embodying an overarching cultural ideal, design for living, and definition of the good life or society. Calls for a new narrative for aging are a familiar idiom for arguing about needed social transformations (Diehl, Smyer, & Mehrotra, 2021). Master narratives have the power to create and explain events, conflicts, and resolutions as manifestations of that ideal. Autobiographic narratives craft life themes over time from the unfolding of life journeys events, beliefs, and experiences acquired across life course stages, transitions, and developmental eras lived in historical periods, family events, and conditions.Constructing narratives about individual lives, bodies, or society is a common form of talking about aging by scientists and popular media. A narrative account provides a higher order idea or meaning by explaining events and facts. Narratives are a distinctively human form of reasoning and meaning-making beyond words or phrases. In the sociolinguistic view, narratives report a sequence of events, experiences, and an evaluation or a moral to the account. A narrative differs from merely listing events, facts, or ideas.The word stew of ageist terms and stereotypes that encode demeaning microaggressions remains a worthy focus of policy, study, and social action.The critical point is that understanding narratives about aging can contribute insights into foundational issues in creating meaning, particularly those that shape how we envision and meet challenges, appraise, and regulate relationships among people, places, and events. This issue ofGenerations Journalfeatures a spectrum of narratives from the individual to the global in scope.Gerontologists are increasingly developing specialized languages to expand our capacity to discern and build accurate narratives about aging. These languages are needed to give voice to the nature of aging across scalar levels (social, biological, or historical eras within a society), from the cross-national and cross-cultural harmonized datasets social epidemiologists construct to create conversations about global and local patterns of later life, health, (seeKobayashi) to the individual actively constructing lifelong personal biographies, which challenge stereotypes of what later life should be and can be when national culture changes, such as when the politics of Poland shifted from Soviet Socialism to Capitalism (seeRobbins-Panko). At both scalar levels, we have learned to talk about aging as a larger unit, produced at the intersections of diverse historical conditions, social policy and political economies, natural events, and cultural definitions of gender.Less visible but rich conversations about aging are embedded in the materiality of our everyday taken-for-granted life. Silent, unending conversations with older persons are expressed in a vocabulary whose terms are those of the physical materials and designs created by our human-built environment and technologies. That is, the designs and devices we use for buildings, streets, and everyday items, such as electronic door keypads and microwave controls, actively support and limit possibilities for people to engage in the routines and habits needed for participating in daily life. Such designs shape differently and disenfranchise legitimate expectations and experiences for moving through spaces and engaging in everyday technologies affordances (seeGaber and Brorsson).Yet, while talk about aging is coming to occupy a public center stage, from a justice perspective, some dialogues for aging remain less spoken or silenced and wait in the wings offstage of our mainstream communities. In this issue, we also hear talk of aging from the worlds of persons aging differently and marginalized due to contemporary beliefs and social practices related to gender, ethnicity, and their intersections in LGBTQ communities of color (seePickard,McCoy. Curiously, even in genres where the authors purpose is to create imaginary future societies, such as in science fiction, seldom include older persons. Even the alternative socially just worlds of science fiction too often replicate negative attitudes toward aging women in a quest to return them to a state of youth (Wrigley, 2019).The final section of this issue circles back in two ways from the societal level by returning to a rich axiom of how gerontologists talk about aging, that is, as individual lives lived through times and places. Individual differences are in the protean variety of self-biographymaking as it unfolds over time, the autobiographic narrative enterprise. Ones stance and understandings, resistances to, and embrace of aging changes fluidly over the lifetime leadingAchenbaumto urge appreciation of distinctive journeys of living into death.Randallargues for talking about aging as a time for seeking and relishing possibilities for new adventures, and against more familiar biographical enterprises where making sense of the life lived and ones future in later life feature railing against or mourning losses and declines, or relatively complacent continuity with the past.Considering how we talk about aging would be incomplete without attention to questions that arise by recognizing that aging concerns, issues, and experiences are inherently intergenerational. We invited two generations of gerontologists to talk about aging. Senior scholars who devoted careers to studying aging were asked to reflect on the parallels of a life lived studying aging and their development, while being and becoming one of those persons. The resulting essays, not unexpectedly, offer distinctly different formats for talking about their life, the articulation and focus of what comprised career and aging experiences (seeBorell,Lichtenberg,Markides,Morrow-Howell,andOry).The final article takes up an unusual opportunity to ask questions about how and in what way the thoughts of senior scholars are heard as meaningful to the newest generation of scholars who are starting to chart their careers and lives and doing so at different times and states of gerontological knowledge (seeDaugherty et al.). An intergenerational dialog was created by sharing the essays with emerging scholars (doctoral, post-doctoral, and junior faculty) who report here on the themes and takeaway messages from their dialogue discussing the articles.Ultimately, the hope is that the seeds of this collections ambitions to describe the complexity of ways we talk about aging take root and help grow better designs for lives lived long and meaningfully.Mark R.

This could partially be due to his training as a social anthropologist, and his affinity for hands-on projects. He is a professor in Wayne State Universitys (WSU) Institute of Gerontology, director of Aging and Health Disparities Research, and professor of Anthropology. And he co-directs Social Work and Anthropology, an innovative integrated doctoral degree at WSU.His academic and professional path has been winding, as although aging may not have been on the radar of social anthropologists while he was studying in the 1980s, his dissertation field work compared the retirement transitions of men and women.That work enabled me to join the Philadelphia Geriatric Center as one of what the research director M. Powell Lawton deemed his infestation of anthropologists among multidisciplinary researchers, said Luborsky. During that time, he helped to establish the Association for Anthropology and Gerontology, moving to Wayne State in 1997.In Detroit hes working on an initiative with the Detroit Mercy College of Dentistry to alleviate oral health disparities among older minorities, and in Sweden hes at work on a team project, Application and Evaluation of a Method to Co-Create learning Organizations in Health and Social Care for Frail Older Persons, which includes training providers in narrative strategies to enhance patient-centered care.He is also writing up a multiyear, multidisciplinary project that involved the EPA, CDC, Michigan Department of Health, and community groups examining exposure to environmentally persistent industrial toxicants (e.g., PCBs, mercury) among disadvantaged Detroiters who fish to provide sustenance. The project culminated in devising and evaluating interventions. Findings identified significant harmful chemical levels and health promotion challenges and solutions requiring attention to the intersections of historical, cultural, biological, and behavioral issues. The result of the work was an interactive museum exhibit Follow the Lines: Environmental Legacy, Health & Fishing the Detroit River, which drew more than 4,000 residents.For two terms Luborsky served as editor-in-chief ofMedical Anthropology Quarterly: International Journal for Analysis of Health.This work all aligns with Luborskys deep curiosity about how people seek continuity and change across the lifespan, and why some individuals and organizations function well long-term in facing hardships due to health or life circumstances and transitions, yet others struggle unendingly.While Ive received my share of awards for research and mentoring, I'm particularly grateful for the recognition of international scientific leadership when I was competitively selected for appointment to full professor as Foreign Adjunct Professor in the Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences, and Society at the Karolinska Institutet Medical University, Stockholm, Sweden. I spent several weeks multiple times a year there for over 20 years.As a bonus, attending the Nobel ceremony and banquets is quite the experience, he said.Why do some people and organizations function well facing hardships due to health or life circumstances and transitions, yet others struggle unendingly?While pondering whether to guest edit this remarkable issue ofGenerations Journal, Luborsky wandered into a nearby old cemetery where he found a section for infants, an adjacent area for unwed mothers, and in the center a circle of church leaders. Preserved for eternity in death was a life narrative embodied in motion and places I traversed, which maps our American views of life stage categories, judgments about life circumstances and community social positions. The narrative path also recreated normative but now resisted older cultural categories of social life.This walking narrative connected viscerally with me to the invitation to speak to audiences about ways to see necessary but less well-recognized forms by which we discuss ideas about age and aging, he said.He hopes readers curiosity will be stimulated to ask new questions. How many ways do we talk about aging? How can we now recognize it and use it to confront otherwise commonsense, taken-for-granted ideas and practices about aging and later life?I hope such questions can advance readers work in research, policy, or practice, Luborsky added.He thinks raising their awareness of the ways we talk about aging can open new opportunities for learning and interventions such as in the design of our built environment, daily technology, cross-cultural data, political structures, media, and career paths. Also, learning the diverse ways senior scholars and older people talk about their lives and careers can highlight alternative routes for living long lives as they span successively different times, places, and conditions.This issue offers tools in the form of critical concepts that can lead to more productive questions and studies. How do we define the case of aging and what to include in that definition? For instance, now we define aging in a more intersectional way than we had in the past, moving away from defining aging only in terms of the chronologically advanced body. Also, Luborsky included in the issue ways to talk about aging using international quantitative databases for comparison, cross-national ethics for late-life, or comparisons between historical periods in one country.His take on how we talk about aging is a philosophical, anthropological, academic and practical exercise, all at the same time. Its a fascinating issue put together by a complicated person, and I hope you learn as much as I did while reading it.Alison Biggar is ASAs Editorial Director.Photo credit: Shutterstock/fran_kieYou may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

Despite changes in public sentiment, race, sexuality, and sexual identity continue to influence personal and public responses to their needs as stigma stands as a formidable barrier to access to services. This article is a discussion of how sexuality introduces infrequently addressed levels of complexity to their lives, and it is a call to action in the hopes that data and social analyses will empower grassroots activism that will garner positive change for LGBTQ elders, especially Black elders.Key Words:LGBTQ aging, Black LGBTQ elders, racism, oppression, homophobiaThe challenges of growing older for LGBTQ people are many and tremendous. My expedition through aging is shaped by a strident, multidimensional, and, at times, perplexing identity: Black lesbian medical anthropologist activist pastor. This journey has become at once daunting and delightful, challenging and comforting. It is overwhelming and pleasant to have simply lived more than 7 decades.Growing up, it seemed normal to imagine aging as mirroring the experiences of my parents and grandparents. I expected my hair to turn gray and my eyesight to diminish. My body would become less flexible, my hearing would weaken, and life would be a constant dance of avoiding or surviving the many chronic illnesses hiding in the shadows.For some reason, it never occurred to me that sexuality could be a significant factor for a woman of a certain age. For some reason, I believed there was a point at which life leveled off, and breathing was all that mattered. Part of me somehow expected to outgrow my gay self and just be my old self. Imagine my surprise to learn that aging was just one more coming-out adventure, yet another journey through the pathways of oppression I had navigated in my life since birth.There is a growing body of data on how sexuality and sexual identity obscure aging and shape public understanding and empathy. As a scholar, I wantedno, neededto trust the data; I wanted to live with hope and proudly march toward transformation and health. How could life be otherwise? Everyone likes old people, and, at least in theory, everyone wants the best for individuals who remind them of their grandparents.But in reality, the data collected using anthropological observation and participation methods reveal how little changes for LGBTQ older adults, especially Black LGBTQ elders. At the end of the day, understanding and empathy rarely go beyond an academic conversation. This article discusses a dimension of aging for the LGBTQ folks who fell through the cracks in the data. It illustrates the great dangers inherent in public policies steeped more in data than in lived experiences and offers a few potential responses.Many Black LGBTQ people do not know the data and how it can carry them down a path into aging that differs from the journey they have been familiar with all of their lives. I hope the information discussed here will somehow breathe new perspectives into existing responses to data and influence a different articulation of and inquiry into aging.Coming Out OldFor most LGBTQ people, coming out is a never-ending, revolving-door experience. It begins before puberty with questions and continues through complex contradictions appearing at every developmental juncture. At first, it is about coming out to oneself, noticing something different emerging from a place of mystery and confusion. Why am I attracted to her while my girlfriends are swooning over him? Why does it feel so good when he brushes against me on the basketball court while the other guys push him away? Why dont I want to dance with her or marry him? Most of all, why do I feel wrong, broken, and misplaced all the time?Then, at some point, words emerge to give life meaning. It becomes painfully apparent that there is a label for what you have felt for so long, and the world can now call you something other than strange. Lesbian. Gay. Bisexual. Transgender. Queer.Although life becomes a cacophony of joys and sorrows, victories and defeats, knowing what to call yourself brings a kind of comfort to LGBTQ people that is at once harsh and consoling. They can cautiously move and rejoice as public awareness and acceptance evolve. Progressive and liberal sensibilities surface as trendy acceptances of all things different.Part of me somehow expected to outgrow my gay self and just be my old self.With the turn of the century came a shift in attitudes about who and what people were born to be, and coming out, while still challenging, became fashionable, almost a requirement for invitations to parties, churches, and public demonstrations against all categories of injustice. Pathways obstructed by ignorance and discrimination gradually cleared, and opportunities for disclosure and open expressions of sexuality and sexual identity expanded.It has been said that growing old is not for the faint of heart. There is no better representation of this sentiment than LGBTQ older adults of the 21st century. This Baby Boomer generation has lived through a whirlwind of contradictions, conflicts, and circumstances like no other group before them. They emerged into an American Dream that was advancing as a strict ethos of heterosexuality; the ideal family was a husband who provides, a wife who produces, and children who obey. Few imagined that the rights and privileges LGBTQ people enjoy today would have been possible during their lifetimes.There has been no other point in history when LGBTQ persons could be such visible contributors to the making of America, no more significant example of a social contract honored. Then life happens again, and the angst of childhood returns with the realization that the circle of life is closing in. According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2016), more than 2 million LGBTQ people are ages 50 or older, 1.1 million are ages 65 or older, 20% are people of color, and there are more than 1.2 million African-American LGBTQ persons.As with other marginalized groups, LGBTQ people are disproportionately affected by social determinants of health. One-third of the LGBTQ population live at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, among which 40% are African American, 40% are Latinx, and 48% are transgender individuals (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). Almost one-third of LGBTQ adults older than age 65 live at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (Emlet, 2016).Coming Out Old, Black, and UnhealthyColin (the names and geographic locations have been changed in all subjects) is a 73-year-old Black gay man who grew up in the South. His family loved him but found his feminine demeanor embarrassing and contradictory to their strong Baptist values. After graduating from high school, he left Georgia to escape the constant ridicule and violence against his sexuality. He credits surviving the blatant racism of the South with giving him the stamina to withstand homophobia.He worked as a home health aide for more 25 years in several cities, finally settling down in the Midwest. At age 58, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer but could still work part-time. He had been estranged from his family for many years because of his sexuality. Although he had built an alternative LGBTQ family, many of his closest friends had died from HIV. Those who escaped HIV began dying from or being crippled by the ordinary illnesses of aging.A year after recovering from cancer, he was diagnosed with diabetes and advanced osteoarthritis and had to live on Social Security Disability Insurance. The decreased income required him to move to a low-income apartment for older adults. He was unable to go to bars, which had been his only social outlet for most of his life, and felt awkward participating in the social activities offered at the apartment complex.Nothing in his experience as a Black gay man who once danced into the wee hours of the morning made playing Bingo and Mah Jong interesting. He began drinking alone more often, which exacerbated his illnesses. His only connection with any kind of community was through online chat sites. After being scammed a couple of times by men he met online, he gave up and just sat in his apartment watching television, becoming more depressed and incapacitated.Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE), the largest and oldest organization dedicated to supporting and empowering LGBTQ older adults, highlights three areas in which the impact of sexuality is especially significant for LGBTQ elders. The first is the overall effect of discrimination. This is particularly poignant for Black elders who, like Colin, have faced racial inequalities from birth. It has been reported that Black LGBTQ older adults are discriminated against because of their sexuality more frequently than are older Whites. They also have lower incomes and educational attainment, less social support, and higher levels of sexuality-related stigma (Kim et al., 2017).He credits surviving the blatant racism of the South with giving him the stamina to withstand homophobia.The second area that impacts LGBTQ older adults identified by SAGE is their need to create a family of choice. Due to familial rejection and legalized discrimination, their reliance upon chosen family creates social isolation and vulnerability for LGBT elders. Research reveals that LGBTQ people are more likely to not be in relationships, to live alone, and to have fewer support systems, such as children and relatives. The third area of impact reported by SAGE is that LGBTQ older adults are at increased risk for health problems, including smoking, obesity, alcohol abuse, mental illness, and HIV infection.These infirmities are more severe due to discrimination and social isolation. Infectious diseases and other health problems present especially onerous situations for older adults in general. Wallace and colleagues (2011) found that LGBTQ older adults had poorer overall health than did their heterosexual peers. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 9 in 10 deaths from COVID-19 were among persons older than age 65, and more than 70% of those who died from flu-related deaths were older adults (Tejada-Vera & Kramarow, 2022). When a lifetime of racial discrimination is accompanied by a second tier grounded in sexuality, inequities in healthcare take on a new dimension for Black LGBTQ elders, and disparities in mental and physical health abound.Coming Out Old, Black, and with HIVMichael, a 65-year-old Black gay man living in Florida, was diagnosed with HIV in 1981, just as the disease debuted. He cant remember how he contracted the virus. He only remembers feeling fear and shame, waking up each day surprised to still be alive. Medication has prolonged his life and enabled him to survive. Homophobia, both expressed by the public and internalized, prevented him from having a decent job, living in a safe environment, or getting an education.He had grown up working with his father on a farm in the South and had become quite good at yard work. Before being diagnosed with HIV, he was able to secure a job on the landscape crew at a university, which provided him with a steady paycheck and health benefits. When Michael was first infected, the lack of treatment options crippled his body and deadened his spirit, and for years he was unable to work.However, Anti-Retroviral Therapy strengthened his body to a point where he could supplement his Supplemental Security Income by doing landscaping jobs on the side and off the books. As Michael ages, however, he deals with multiple comorbidities. He has had two heart attacks, resulting in heart stents and daily cholesterol medication. Many of his friends have died from HIV, including those who managed to survive the disease for years. He smokes marijuana and drinks alcohol excessively. He moved back to live with his family in the South when rising costs made living in Seattle impossible. The healthcare system in Florida is markedly different for persons with HIV, but he gets around that by not reporting his move. He has a friend who picks up his medications and regularly mails them to him, but he lives in constant fear that his scheme will be uncovered or his health will worsen. He receives Social Security, food stamps, and a small stipend from his old job. Its just enough to help with groceries and buy enough beer and marijuana to fill the gaps in his life.Now, Michael just cuts grass. Every morning, he wakes up hoping that a neighbor will call and need him to help make their yard pretty or ask his advice about how to get more vegetables and fewer weeds. If no one calls, he works in his yard, trying to do whatever he can to give life meaning, just for one more day. Maybe he can make that avocado tree stop losing leaves or figure out how to keep the rats from eating his tomatoes. Maybe this or perhaps that. His life has become a saga of isolation and despair shared by many other Black gay men.Since the disease first surfaced, Black people have been most disproportionately affected by HIV. This remains the case, with Blacks accounting for 40% of new diagnoses in 2021 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). Although antiretroviral medications have enabled persons with HIV to live longer, the disease exacerbates the burdens that already challenge Black LGBTQ people. Most were infected during their youth or in middle age. The preexisting robust and blatant racism and homophobia, coupled with HIV stigma, make life even more catastrophic. For many, just when it was almost safe to come out as a homosexual, HIV appeared to drive them deeper into new and unexpected closets of shame and hopelessness.Coming Out Old and FemaleMargaret and Phylis met at a neighborhood card party in their 20s and became good friends. Eventually, they decided to come out as lesbians and build a life together. Margaret worked as a housekeeper in a hotel in Detroit for more than 32 years, until it closed due to the areas financial distress. She received a modest settlement and a small pension check every month.Phylis worked on the production line at an automobile factory until she retired after 30 years with a generous pension and retirement savings. Throughout their relationship, Phylis had taken charge of everything; she managed their financial and social lives. Because of income and credit ratings differences, everything had been purchased in her name. Margaret suffered from hypertension most of her life and had severe back problems from years of working as a maid. For the most part, however, life had been pleasant for more than 40 years. They bought a small house together, frequently hosted parties, took vacations every year with a small circle of LGBTQ friends, and had a few supportive family members.Things changed drastically when Phylis was suddenly killed in an automobile accident. The day after her funeral, her family appeared at the door to take possession of everything Phylis and Margaret had worked so hard to build together. Margaret had no legal standing because they were not married. She was given a month to pack her things and find somewhere else to live. With the help of a sympathetic lawyer, Margaret received a small settlement, which was enough to rent an apartment in a senior complex. She was also allowed to keep some of their furniture and mementos from their relationship.Aging for Black LGBTQ adults living on low or limited incomes is merely a continuation of the multilayered oppression they have always experienced.Unlike Phylis, she had no family and considered their friends to be her adopted family. However, she was embarrassed by her losses and became distant from those friends. At age 67, she found herself alone and having to start over again with very few resources.Fredriksen-Goldsen and colleagues (2013a) analyzed data from the 20032010 Washington State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) on health outcomes and chronic conditions. They reported significant differences in the chances of older lesbians and bisexual women becoming disabled and having mental health challenges compared to heterosexual women and having greater odds of obesity. Also, it was determined that older lesbians are more likely to drink excessively and smoke than heterosexual women.Coming Out Old and UninformedStanding under the umbrella of trendy gayness, LGBTQ older adults must face the potentially crippling challenge of coming out while old. There is a growing mountain of academic articles and reports on aging replete with stories similar to those mentioned here. Primarily they include accounts of how things are bad but improving, highlighting this program or that policy to offer direction and hope for LGBTQ older adults. Alas, this information rarely trickles down to those who need it most. A lifetime of discrimination, especially in housing, education, and employment, along with legalized discrimination and social rejection, has resulted in severe economic insecurity and limited access to services and information for this population.Without direction, new information, shared resources, and proactive support, Black LGBTQ older adults are left with familiar and historical experiences to shape their later life expectations. They know firsthand the limitations placed on their lives by race. They know the constraints wrapped around their lives by the racism they encountered within LGBTQ communities. They remember being carded when trying to go to gay bars that restricted access to only a few attractive young Black people. Those policies have not changed much in recent years, so older LGBTQ Black people simply expect and receive more of the same. The data fail to reveal how aging for Black LGBTQ adults living on low or limited incomes is merely a continuation of the multilayered oppression they have always experienced.The only difference is a wider web of loneliness caused by deaths and illnesses threatening their sanity and distorting their futures. They never read the articles and reports because they dont move in those circles. They never did. Their only contact with academia was when researchers needed to diversify their sample. Even then, they seldom found out what happened with the stories they shared.Coming Out Black and Empowered: Transformative AgingPerhaps this articles overarching goal is to issue a call to action for academics, community organizers, and anyone concerned about the lives and futures of aging LGBTQ persons. It is time for data and social analyses to empower grassroots activism that will garner positive change for LGBTQ elders, especially Black people, who have been observed and discussed, counted, and chronicled without equitable benefit for far too long. Isolation and healthcare are critical issues.Perhaps now is the time for the academic community to step up. There are few LGBTQ community centers throughout the country. It would be a mighty effort to establish senior centers all across the country designed to accommodate the needs of LGBTQ older adults. These facilities might offer informational programs about surviving the homophobia that frequently accompanies racism.Programs could be offered to help navigate end-of-life issues and understand how new governmental and public health policies have brought positive changes and opportunities. An LGBTQ senior center, for example, can be a place for intergenerational relations to be nurtured and histories shared. Many LGBTQ elders today had few role models as they were growing up and more examples of brokenness than inspirations for greatness. Researchers must share the knowledge they collect in ways that will provide more than fodder for their curriculum vitae.The data suggest that many individuals providing health services to LGBTQ persons are sorely crippled by their own implicit biases. It is critical for providers in all areas and at all levels to receive extensive cultural sensitivity training that addresses the ethos of LGBTQ elders. For example, spirituality is an essential component of Black culture. Despite the oppressive attitudes Black LGBTQ people have encountered from people of faith, many continue to embrace and depend upon the spiritual values and practices they received throughout their lives. They are fed by the messages of hope and survival, animated by the spirit of joy, and emboldened by the promises of liberation.These are but a few recommendations for making data come alive for LGBTQ adults. The bottom line is that getting old is definitely not for the weak. As a Black lesbian who is growing older with every setting sun, it is my simple hope that my final days and those of my peers will somehow be cluttered with efforts and energies to keep us excited and filled with passion and promise.Rev.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalFall 2023A More Complete Story of Aging: Age as Deficit and as AssetBy Nancy Morrow-HowellOctober 18, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingAbstract:My research career began focused on age-as-deficit; then, when studying productive aging, I moved to an age-as-asset perspective. I have come to another understanding of later life: deficits and assets exist within older adults and within the older population. We must tell the full and accurate story of aging and eliminate artificial limits curtailing engagement in life. Real limits exist as our bodies grow old; but powerful artificial limits are created by physical and social structures, policies, organizational practices, attitudes, expectations, and internalized beliefs about aging. If we eliminate artificial limits, we might handle real limits better, both individually and as a society.Key Words:ageism, productive aging, internalized ageism, age-friendlyMy scholarship has focused on the productive engagement of older adults. The concept of productive aging originated more than 40 years ago. Dr. Robert Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging, introduced the term out of dismay over the discounting of older people and the rampant ageism in this society (Butler & Gleason, 1985). He railed against the negative characterization of older people as a drain on society and against the prevailing view of age as deficit. He advocated for moving attention away from the problems of old age to a more realistic picture of the current and potential contributions of older adults to families, communities, and societies.Butler (1997) argued that our society needed the capacity of older adults as workers, volunteers, and caregivers. From these advocacy roots came a new paradigm for population aging wherein the capacity of older adults is recognized as a resource for families and communities and older adults are seen as assets (Bass et al., 1993).I got on Butlers productive aging bandwagon about a decade after scholars began developing conceptual frameworks and conducting analyses to understand antecedents and outcomes of productive engagement. That is not where I had started my scholarly work. As a gerontological social worker, I began my academic career with a focus on theproblems, on addressing the need for assistance in the older population. My research centered on aging network services: who needed what, who got what, what were the barriers and unmet needs, what were the outcomes. These were, and still are, very central topics for a gerontological social worker.Over time, I became aware that I was very unevenly exposed to the experiences of growing old and later life. In my work, all older adults were clients or patientsin need of assistance. My profession is devoted to helping people deal with challenges they face in everyday life. Social workers see people because something is wrong, because there is a social, psychological, or financial need. We are overexposed to problems, tough situations, and poor quality of life. It is easy to overgeneralize. I was totally immersed in the age-as-deficit reality. These issues are real, they are challenging, and they deserve our professional commitment.When my colleagues and I at Washington University began to study the productive aging literature, I became aware of another reality, another side of the story about aging. Butlers productive aging paradigm was an antidote for me, as it was to a field focused on the problems of aging. In my new scholarship, we focused on older adults doing paid and unpaid work, and we focused on programs and policies to optimize this engagement. We talked about positive outcomes to communities and society and how to ensure the best outcomes for the older adults themselves as workers, volunteers, and caregivers (Morrow-Howell et al., 2001). My new perspective: age as asset.There are real limits as we grow old and there are artificial limits.From the beginning of the scholarship on productive aging, there have been critics. Scholars and advocates worried about the potential to exploit and marginalize older people, especially those who had been disadvantaged over the life course. Moody (1993) argued that the productive aging paradigm forwarded the values of growth, energy, activity, accumulation, and efficacy, and suppressed a wider vision of later life. Scholars acknowledged that the paradigm was intended to confront the age-as-decline and the greedy-geezer narratives; but they were concerned that it was an extension of market logic, where economic worth was the highest value and where individuals who could not produce would be denigrated (Estes & Mahakian, 2001; Holstein, 1999).Further, I often heard from others that my perspective was too optimistic, that it denied the reality of decline and incapacity. It denied the realities of later life for many (if not most) people and the end of life.I am now at a different place, and I have arrived here for several reasons: I have entered my 7th decade of life; I have become involved in the Gerontological Society of Americas Reframing Aging Initiative (www.reframingaging.org); and I am surrounded at my university and community with heightened attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion. With these changes, I have reframed my own aging and scholarly work on productive engagement. I understand more about the concerns regarding the productive aging framework, and I am more aware of solutions.I have concluded that the productive aging perspective enables us to tell the whole story, which is an accurate story of aging and older adults. Yes, there are declines and the need for help; and many older people are challenged or unable to engage in the roles we are advocating. There is truth to Bette Daviss famous line: Old age aint no place for sissies! At the same time, there is much functional ability, human capital, vitality, and courage. Age as deficit and age as asset are both true at the same time. It took me a while to truly embrace this in how I think about aging. Neither side of the coin will do. If we focus on the deficits, we perpetuate stereotypes and the elderly become a monolithic group of dependent people.If we focus on the capacity inherent in this group, we risk ignoring the need for services and the compromised functional positions most of us will experience.Perhaps my strong leaning toward the assets of aging, the opportunities in older societies, was necessary to counteract the age-as-deficit narrative that was so pervasive in gerontological social work. But now I strive to tell the full story. Older adults need caregivers and older adults are caregivers; older adults need home-delivered meals and older adults deliver meals. Some older adults can work longer and some cant. Im personally experiencing both sides of aging: there is loss of strength, loss of physical resilience, and loss of speed; and there are new understandings about purpose, moderated emotions, wiser perspectives, and increased generative commitments. My realities have increased my understanding of deficits and assets.Over my academic years, the realities about biological, psychological, and social aging are largely the same. I teach the same content, but I teach it differently. I lead with the heterogeneity of the older populationkey message number one. I follow with stats that show how many people older than age 65can dosomething as well as how many cannot. We usually show charts that report how many people in certain age groups have a specific condition or disability. What a different (yet true) story to report that 81% of the U.S. population older than age 65 does not report any significant disability (Administration on Community Living, 2021).Alongside charts that show the upward trend of cognitive impairment with advancing age, I emphasize that most people live their lives without experiencing dementia. I make sure to point out that death is universalmost of us will experience chronic conditions, disability, and dependence, and all of us will die. There are limits to human functioning.There are natural limits to our abilities. Many of us will lose the ability to work, to volunteer, to drive, to shop, to manage our own finances. I have gained some clarity that a significant challenge for us is to recognize that there are real limits and there are artificial limits. In the productive aging paradigm, we focus on artificial limitsorganizational practices and physical and social environments that curtail engagement. We focus on policies and programs that could engage the capacity of the older population. Removing barriers and creating opportunitiesthese are words about eliminating artificial limits. Real limits in human functioning exist but, if we operate from an age-as-deficit perspective, artificial limits look like real limits.Of course, gerontologists have long recognized the role of environment in enabling function (Lawton & Nahemow, 1973) and the role of policies and programs in shaping productive behavior (Bass & Caro, 1996). My new understanding is that these interventions are aimed at artificial limits. Further, gerontological professionals, including doctors, rehabilitation therapists, social workers, as well as family members, have struggled to identify what is artificial and what is real. I think that in general, we have exaggerated the real limits because it is more convenient. You cant do this because you are old, rather than you cant do this because we dont have the time (or resources, or structures, or knowledge) to facilitate that.One artificial barrier has become clearer to me: internalized ageism.The age-friendly environment movement (including communities, healthcare systems, workplaces, and institutions of higher education) is based on the notion of eliminating artificial barriers. Some artificial barriers are clearphysical structures that prevent easy access, policies that work against older employees, or practices in higher education that discourage engagement of older students. Others are less obvious: societal norms about what older people should and shouldnt do, family and organizational expectations that are age-based, and healthcare decisions that incorporate chronological age into the calculus. There is one artificial barrier that has become clearer to me: internalized ageism.Internalized ageism is self-directed ageism and occurs when age stereotypes learned across the life course are assimilated and believed; these internalized messages are activated in later life (Levy, 2022). Well, at age 71, these ingrained ideas about being old are raising their ugly heads. Should I retire because it is expected of me? Is my hesitancy to drive at night due to real sensory declines or due to lack of confidence? Is my forgetfulness worse than it has ever been and is it dementia? It is complicated because I dont know what is a real limit and what is artificial.I have come to understand that ageism is a big part of the challenge to achieving a productive aging society (Bass et al., 1993) and I have come to situate it more clearly among the biases that limit the potential of longer, healthier lives. Ageism exists alongside racism, sexism, homophobia, classism, ableism, and other isms that thwart opportunity and pervert attitudes and expectations. My increased awareness of ageism as an artificial limit has heightened my appreciation of the unnecessary barriers to long and healthy lives created by the other biased beliefs related to race, ethnicity, gender identity, etc.My productive aging lens is now different; my understanding of later life is now different (but still incomplete, I imagine, until declines in health prevent the engagements that I love). The full story of aging involves deficits and assets. Both sides exist within individual older adults and within the older population. We cannot focus on just one side. We must develop programs and policies for both sides. We must tell the full and accurate story of aging, and design accordingly. But no program or policy will be enough to facilitate productive engagement and long and healthy lives if ageism continues to permeate society. Ageism cannot be considered in isolation from the other prejudices that plague our society; nor can it remain as invisible and pervasive as we have let it be to this point.Real limits exist as our bodies grow old; but there are powerful artificial limits created by physical and social structures, policies, organizational practices, attitudes, expectations, and internalized beliefs about aging. If we can eliminate artificial limits, we might handle real limits better, individually and as a societywith more formal and informal support, with more compassion, with more dignity.Nancy Morrow-Howell, PhD, is the Betty Bofinger Brown Distinguished Professor of Social Policy at Washington University in St. Louis.Photo credit: Shutterstock/beeboysReferencesAdministration on Community Living (2021, May).2020 profile of older Americans.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2023Solo Agers Can Find Independence in Planning and AdvocacyBy Eric J. Einhart, Judith M. Flynn, and Roberta K. FlowersJune 21, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureEconomic SecurityHealth & Well-beingAbstract:Older adults who lack the historically traditional support system of a spouse and/or adult children face greater challenges related to personal finance, access to healthcare and long-term care, and personal autonomy as they age. These individuals are commonly referred to as Solo Agers. The options available for most older adults to make major life decisions generally require another person to act on their behalf as a representative or advocate. Therefore, Solo Agers must use strategic planning and engage experienced advocates for a successful life in their later years.Key Words:long-term care, independence, estate planning, elder law attorneyOur society places a significant value on personal autonomy, self-determination, and the ability to control ones own destiny. Unfortunately, sometimes the challenges life bestows upon us, such as chronic illness, traumatic events, injuries, and aging, can cause an individuals independence to be questioned, diminished, and even eliminated.While many older adults may face challenges as they age, those who lack the historically traditional support system of a spouse and/or adult children may face even greater challenges (Thayer, 2021). These individuals are commonly referred to as Solo Agersmeaning people who live alone without a spouse or partner, and either have no children or their children live far away, are estranged, or have special needs (Partnerships in Aging Program, n.d.). Aging alone, or solo aging, is not a unique phenomenon. There are approximately 22.1 million Solo Agers in America, and an estimated 27.7% of older adults who live alone are childless (U.S. Census Bureau, 2021).The PeopleRelying on close family members such as a spouse and/or adult children, friends, or other trusted partners can be an extension of ones personal autonomy (Lin & Wolf, 2019). But what happens if you do not have someone to rely upon as an advocate or care partner?Many Solo Agers face similar challenges, as described below.VirginiaVirginia is an 84-year-old widow whose husband, Ulysses, died 2 months ago. Virginia and Ulysses fell in love in high school. They were married when Ulysses returned from the Army and remained inseparable for almost 65 years. They had one son who died. Virginias closest relative is a niece who lives hundreds of miles away. While Virginia is active in her church and volunteers regularly in her community, she has not yet identified a trusted individual to advocate for her or help with her needs.JuanJuan is a 92-year-old widower who lives with and cares for his developmentally disabled son, Marc. Juans wife died 15 years ago, and he and Marc live alone. Juan worries about Marcs future should he pass away, due to his age and because he has health issues. Most of his friends have either died or retired to a warmer climate, and his nearest relatives are cousins he hasnt seen since he left Puerto Rico 80 years ago. Juans only regular interactions are with his doctors and his barber.Don and CharleyDon and Charley were married in 2016 following the legalization of same-sex marriage, but they have been partners for almost 30 years. Don, who is 86, is 20 years older than Charley and is experiencing signs of dementia and other chronic illnesses. Don has two children who are about the same age as his husband. Charley has no children and is estranged from his family. Although the couple is very involved in the LGBTQ+ community, most of their friends live out of state. Charley is concerned that he will have no one to care for him as he ages if Don dies before him. He is also worried about being the primary caregiver for Don and navigating family conflict with Dons adult children.HedyHedy is a 70-year-old woman who is divorced and has no children. She is an only child and moved in with her father after her mother died. She cared for her father as he struggled with Parkinsons disease and is grieving his recent death. Although Hedy is retired, she still maintains a few close friends from her old job. She also has a close relationship with a woman who has lived across the street from her parents for almost 40 years. Since her father died, Hedy spends most holidays with her neighbors family.Although everyone in these examples has a unique background, two common scenarios can be identified repeatedly for most Solo Agers:They live alone or expect to live alone at some point in the future; andThey have a limited number of or no relatives or friends to care for them as they age.In these situations, an attorney can help the Solo Ager set the course for their future by developing a plan.The PlanThe thought of becoming incapacitated and eventually dying can be frightening to anyone. Imagining going through these life events alone can create an overwhelming sense of anxiety. Proper planning can help reduce anxiety about the future, mitigate challenges, and in many cases avoid disaster. Planning also can ensure that an individuals wishes are put into the language of a care provider, court system, or others. Legal documents help individuals protect themselves against unwanted care and provide a framework to think through what they want their life to look like as they age.From the attorneys perspective, the most basic and fundamental elements to estate and long-term care planning can be broken down tolifetime planningandlegacy planning.Lifetime PlanningThe first question is who will make decisions if the older adult becomes incapacitated or needs assistance. In this case, an attorney can provide recommendations about what legal documents are necessary to allow trusted relatives, friends, or professionals to make these decisions.These documents may include formal legal instruments, such as a Durable Power of Attorney, Health Care Proxy, HIPAA Authorization, and Living Will. These are often referred to as advance directives, meaning that the legal instrument provides a way for an individual to direct their wishes in advance. While the names and legalese of these instruments will vary from state to state, advance directives work to protect the older adults wishes and desired plan of care.The importance for Solo Agers to have advance directives cannot be overstated.The importance for Solo Agers to have advance directives cannot be overstated. If Solo Agers become incapacitated and do not have advance directives in place, they could be subject to the decisions of a court-appointed conservator or guardian. Health systems may require advance directives to provide care or to discharge an individual to their home or a community-based setting. Planning for these situations prevents other parties, such as healthcare providers, financial planners, or others from making decisions for the older adult on their behalf.Paying for CareAnother important consideration in lifetime planning is paying for long-term care. Individuals typically look to three options to pay for long-term care: private pay, long-term care insurance, and public assistance such as Medicaid. Long-term care services are very expensive and private payment of long-term care services for an extended period usually requires considerable financial means or significant income. For many older adults, paying out-of-pocket for long-term care is out of reach.Long-term care insurance (LTCI) is designed to cover long-term care services (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). Policies may cover assistance with activities of daily living, skilled nursing care, homemaker services in conjunction with personal care, and other long-term care services. LTCI policies can be purchased by individuals from an insurance agent, group policies offered by employers, and membership association policies (Center for Insurance Policy and Research, 2022). However, premiums may be cost-prohibitive and coverage may be restrictive. For many older adults, LTCI limits necessary services and imposes unrealistic waiting periods. The old saying Buyer Beware applies here.Older adults may also consider using an existing asset, like a retirement account or home, to cover the cost of care. Solo Agers should access qualified retirement savings to pay for their long-term care services as a last resort. Qualified retired savings can grow, tax-deferred, until they are distributed to the recipient (Individual Retirement Accounts, 1994), and in some states, the principal may be exempt for purposes of Medicaid eligibility (Resource Eligibility Standards, 2004).Others may use home equity to pay for long-term care through a reverse mortgage loan. These loans do not require repayment until the borrower dies, the house is sold, or the borrower vacates the home for 12 months (usually to move to a nursing home; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2022). There are significant costs associated with reverse mortgages and they may not be in the individuals best interest.Finally, people who are aging alone may seek help for long-term care from public assistance or government programs such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) or Medicaid.Veterans should look to the VHA. Benefits may include 24/7 nursing and medical care, physical therapy, help with activities of daily living, comfort care and help with managing pain, support for caregivers who may need skilled help, and respite care. Some VA Medical Centers offer medical foster homes, which pair those who do not have a caregiver with a trained care professional (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2023). Others may be eligible for Aid and Attendance benefits, which is a monthly pension amount paid to eligible veterans or their surviving spouses to cover unreimbursed medical expenses. Eligibility is based on the veterans wartime service, age, disability, income, and assets (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2022). The government also has recently expanded the VA Caregiver Support Program to include new resources and funding for caregivers of veterans of all service areas, including friends or family who care for older adults (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, n.d.).Medicaid comes into play as the payer of last resort because eligibility requires that the recipient has exhausted most other payment options. The recipient must have also pursued long-term care coverage from other assistance programs such as veterans benefits and Medicare. Despite the need for long-term care, many older adults may not be eligible for Medicaid services due to Medicaids resource and income eligibility requirements, which vary from state to state. For many Solo Agers, this means a choice between two difficult paths.The first option is for the older adult to divest themselves of their hard-earned assets that may have taken a lifetime to build and wait to qualify for Medicaid after 60 months. For some, the 5-year wait is too long as long-term care issues may arise during the waiting period. The second option may be even more direto spend down resources so that the individual is poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.Partnering with an attorney helps to ensure that self-advocacy is successful.Given these difficult choices, Solo Agers can benefit from working with an experienced advocate to allow them to make an informed decision. Successful Medicaid planning requires an individual to give up control of assets they hope to protect, usually for the next generation. Such plans typically involve a trustworthy friend or relative who keeps the assets safe in the event they are needed in the future. This loss of control and reliance upon others may not be the best strategy for someone who is aging alone.A better alternative may be for the Solo Ager to spend down their assets to qualify for Medicaid benefits. Before spending down assets, careful consultation with an elder law attorney can help ensure the individual has the resources necessary to maintain their financial independence as they work toward Medicaid eligibility.Legacy PlanningLegacy or estate planning requires thinking about what is important to the individual and how they want to be remembered. An attorney plays the role of drafter, providing instructions to honor the older adults wishes after they die. Adults can develop these documents at any age, and typically will update these documents after major life events such as marriage, divorce, loss of income, or financial windfall.The foundation of any estate plan is a Last Will and Testament (Will). The Solo Ager as the Testator uses the Will to direct who will receive assets and who will be responsible for distributing the assets to the beneficiaries. Although a Will should be part of all estate plans as a safety net, it may not be the best vehicle for administering the assets of Solo Agers. This is because the Will must be processed through a court proceeding known as probate and court proceedings may be costly and lengthy.A better approach for Solo Agers may be to use a legal instrument known as a Revocable Living Trust. During their lifetime, the Solo Ager can use the assets in the trust for their benefit. Upon their death, a successor trustee identified by the older adult would then collect and administer the trust assets according to the Solo Agers wishes and generally without any court involvement. Solo Agers should also establish beneficiary designations on all of their financial accounts, retirement accounts, and insurance policies, which will allow the balance of the accounts to pass automatically to their beneficiaries. For those who do not have a person they would like to receive their assets, charities and other institutions can be designated as a beneficiary, allowing the Solo Ager to support an issue or cause that is meaningful to them (Special Rules for Credits and Deductions, 1993).Planning for the Future You WantMany older adults have learned to advocate for themselves over the course of their lives. For example, those who have cared for parents, a spouse, or a child with special needs are often very familiar with the challenges and obstacles of the U.S. healthcare and social care systems. Others may have experience advocating for themselves as members of a marginalized population, such as the LGBTQ+ and disability communities.The advantage of partnering with an attorney is not to supplant the voice of the older adult, especially those who are aging alone. Rather, partnering with an attorney helps to ensure that self-advocacy is successful. An attorney adds the voice of a trained advocate to ensure that the wishes of their client are honored.There are many reasons why people put off seeking the professional services of an elder law attorney. Many are not aware of the importance of or need for these services, or they may not realize that elder law is a specialized area of practice. Much like the difference in knowledge between a geriatrician and a primary care doctor, an elder law attorney understands the ecosystem of issues that people face as they age.Others may be nervous to speak with an attorney because of fear that they cannot afford the services. But so often the services of an elder law attorney can help avoid disastrous consequences. Legal fees tend to represent a small fraction of an individuals total assets and can help improve the financial situation of the older adult if the attorney successfully secures benefits to help pay for long-term care needs. Those with limited finances may also consider seeking free or low-cost elder law services through their local senior center, legal clinics within local law schools, or an area legal services provider.People who age alone have relied on themselves to develop full, meaningful lives. The latter years of life do not have to be any different. With careful planning and intention, Solo Agers can direct the future they desire and leave a legacy behind them to celebrate their life.Eric J.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2023The Accidental Solo AgerBy Helen DennisJune 21, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingI became an unexpected widow and Solo Ager at age 63. Despite my husbands diagnosis of lymphoma, considered one of the better cancers for remission, I never thought he would die. Yet, after five years of chemotherapy and a failed stem-cell transplant, it happened. On that day, I became a Solo Ager.Losing a spouse is painfulits like losing your second half. For some its the hardest part of life; for others it can make them stronger. For me, it was both. I am not alone in this experience. In 2021, there were 11.6 million widows in the United States (Statistica, 2023), with 2,800 new widows daily. The average age of a widow was 59 (Balasek, 2022).The challenges of new widowhood were many, such as coming home to an empty house. That meant returning from a business trip, event, movie, or presentation, walking through the front door and confronting the deafening quiet and emptiness.Then there was tradition. My husband Lloyd died between the Jewish high holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, a day of prayer and fasting. For decades I have hosted a break-the-fast meal. I remember wondering, Can I do this? Tradition doesnt give you much choice; it does not acknowledge I dont have time or its just too much work. I did host the meal and for the first time faced the empty seat at my dining room table. That was painful. New responsibilities such as paying bills and learning more about insurance were relatively easy tasks compared to addressing the emotional vacuum of being a Solo Ager.Family and friends were supportive. They sent me books, articles, and reports about the grieving process. The words struck me as interesting but did little to fill the void or lessen the grief. Having worked in the field of aging for many years, I was well acquainted with the work of Kbler-Ross and the grieving process. I taught about grief to new and young financial advisors who were learning how to speak with recent widows to address their financial needs. Although I knew some of the literature, reading the articles and books felt like an intellectual exercise.The support group offered catharsis, but I wanted tools, techniques, and suggestions for coping and adjusting.Then I reached what is considered to be the appropriate time to reconnect with the world. I attended a nonprofit board meeting after observing a seven-day mourning when a colleague greeted me, looking shocked, and said, I am very surprised to see you here today. I wasnt sure if I should apologize for showing up or just assure him that I was OK. It was an awkward moment.For this Solo Ager, work and nonprofit activities were saviors. Writing my weekly syndicated column on Successful Aging forced me to stay informed and to produce. Speaking engagements and presenting seminars took me to new venues. Showing up at meetings provided ways to remain connected to colleagues and issues. I had somewhere to go with my mind and soul, something to occupy the empty space.Upon the recommendation of a college roommate, who is also a Solo Ager and a widow, I agreed to join a support group, knowing its value. My expectation was to find some guidance, but very little occurred. As with most support groups, the conversations focused on shared feelings and experiencesa group catharsis, and it felt good to know I was not alone. But I wanted tools, techniques, and suggestions for coping and adjusting. Perhaps that was difficult to achieve because members in the group were at different phases in their grieving processes and had different needs. Some were literally paralyzed; they couldnt wash their dishes or do their laundry, and could barely get out of bed. Others seemed to be managing well.Our final session was memorable, one I hoped would bring some closure. We were asked to bring a photo of our loved one, a candle, and some prepared remarks about them to share with the group. At that final session we went around the room, one by one. Individuals carefully lit their candle, shared their photo, and made some remarks, with several members in tears. I was a wreck and felt I was attending 10 funerals all at once. There was no closure.I decided it was up to me to make this support-group experience work and thought about doing something beyond myself that would make me feel better. I asked permission from the facilitator to engage our group members in helping me write my column addressing What to Sayor Not to SayWhen a Spouse Passes Away, based upon each group members experience. All agreed enthusiastically to participate. The column was the perfect platform.Here were their suggestions:Stay in touch. Send emails, greeting cards for different holidays and make telephone calls. Just thinking of you goes a long way.Be the planner/initiator. Instead of asking, What do you want to do? Say, Ill pick you up at 5:00 and well go to Emilios caf for dinner.Be honest. Say, I dont really know how your feel. I just want you to know that I will always be here for you. Then make sure you are there.Share dinners. Suggest a potluck; you are the company for dinner. Days can become very long.Give a hug. A warm and caring embrace provides a wonderful feel-good moment.Give permission. Tell her it is OK to talk about her deceased husband. Shedding a tear or two is equally acceptable.Suggest overnight company. Ask her if she would like a house guest for the night. This helps fill a void, at least for an evening.The group suggested avoiding these well-intended phrases.I really know how you feel.He is better off.Are you dating yet?Youll get over it.You just need to keep busy.With such a big house, you really should move.Youre young, implying you always can remarry.I am an unexpected Solo Ager. Although it has been 20 years, I still get teary-eyed when I hear Louis Armstrong sing, Its a Wonderful World, the song to which Lloyd and I last danced together at our daughters wedding. I get emotional when I pick up a book from his library on journalism, politics, and economics and read the phrases he underlined and the notations in the margins. I get emotional when his name is read in synagogue on the anniversary of his death and when I recite the traditional kaddish prayer.Perhaps the grieving process never ends. Rather, it morphs into occasional moments of sadness followed by wonderful memories that elevate. Its the latter that matters most.Helen Dennis, MA, is a columnist, author, lecturer, and a specialist in aging and the new retirement.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2023The Backup PlanA New Planning Model that Keeps Solo Agers in MindBy Linda J. CampJune 21, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureInnovation & Social ImpactHealth & Well-beingAbstract:Planning for health and well-being is essential as people age, particularly those who consider themselves to be Solo Agers. Procrastination and fear often contribute to the low rate of plan completion. Research suggests that people will achieve better results when they work together. A new planning model and toolThe Backup Plancan help Solo Agers build community and craft a personal safety net.Key Words:planning, community building, shared problem solving, supported decision making, peer supportTwo common themes run though many articles written about older adults who are aging solo: the importance of planning and of developing social capital. But, despite a plethora of retirement and late-life planning resources, the track record for Solos Agers is not great. As one illustration, a 2021 AARP study of Solos Agers found that some 78% said they had done little or no planning for ongoing living assistance should they need it as they age (Thayer, 2021).So, what can we do to help the avoiders and procrastinators get over the hump? And, of equal importance, how can we help Solos Agers build a community of support at a time when overall participation in organizations of all kinds has declined? In Minnesota, the answer is The Backup Plan model, which tackles both issues together and flips the traditional approach on its head.The Backup PlanSince 2019, a series of small groups have been testing The Backup Plan model, which includes the new model and its associated materials. Evidence-based, the model seeks to help Solo Agers develop a community of support through shared work and problem solving, and by creating individual backup plans. The Backup Plan is a set of strategies, supporters, and other resources Solos Agers can rely upon if they experience a health event or a change in circumstanceslarge or smallwhere they cannot or choose not to function alone.The model also can help organizations that focus on older adults develop the capacity to better serve those who are aging alone. For example, the test groups in Minnesotathree Living at Home/Block Nurse Programs (Living at Home Network, n.d.)traditionally have provided assistance with issues like foot care and rides to medical appointments, but have not helped clients to build personal safety nets.Unlike other planning approaches that typically focus on housing and finances, the focus of The Backup Plan is on helping Solo Agers build skills and gain confidence through health and well-being decision making. The belief is that health and well-being often are core concerns in the second half of life. Health often drives other kinds of decisions as people age. A decision about housing will likely be influenced by needs related to the availability and cost of health/well-being support. There are no checklists of tasks or lists of shoulds for users to follow. Instead, the model encourages Solo Agers to work on achieving results in seven different areas. It is a person-centered approach, recognizing that to be effective, a plan must fit with who Solo Agers are, where they live, their cultural traditions, and the available resources.The Backup Plan model incorporates a Just-In-Time/Just Enough philosophy.Though the materials can be used by individuals, the model is based on the idea that a successful planone that produces the intended resultsrelies on skill, personal accountability, and a community of support. For that reason, the model works best when used in a group setting where the group is supported by a coach.The Backup Plan inverts more typical planning models in other significant ways. First, it is not structured as a program or a workshop with an expert leading participants through a series of predetermined steps. It employs a bottom-up approach in which group members determine the content and the process.Second, while there are guidelines and basic information offered through a participant manual, the goal is for the group to direct itself. The coach is a volunteer whose job is to help the group move forward, not to control the group or be the source of all information the group might need.The Backup Plans model incorporates a Just-In-Time/Just Enough philosophy. For most of us, planning means working toward a tangible goal, such as buying a house or saving for college, over a long period. This kind of approach makes sense for the first half of life because we are starting at ground level, working to accumulate resources, and generally have a number of years before us. However, the second half of life differs from the first half in several important ways:There is more emphasis on using up resources rather than accumulating them;The time perspective generally changes from unlimited to limited; andOur targets are more fluid and less tangible.Thus, The Backup Plan is built around each persons self-knowledge and what realistically might occur in the near future, rather than imaginary situations that may or may not happen many years from now. It is pointless for Solos Agers to worry about who will be available to accompany them to a medical appointment in 10 years, but they can identify options for such support right now.This Just-in-Time/Just Enough approach makes planning less scary and reduces magical thinking, or the belief that ones ideas, thoughts, actions and words, or use of symbols can influence the course of events in the material world (Britannica, 2023). And, it is not about ignoring the future, but rather about helping Solo Agers become more agile and pragmatic planners.Creating the ModelThe overarching goal for this initiative was to create a universal modelone that would be useful and adaptable to a range of Solo Agers, regardless of income level, where they lived, and other personal circumstances. It also had to be low cost, scalable, and able to tap into the life experiences of users. Finally, it had to be based upon solid evidence that the overall approach would yield the hoped-for benefits. To that end, ideas and research from a number of sources fed into the development process.A few examples:Persuading another person to think and/or act differently than in the past is essentially an exercise in behavior changean unspoken objective of a planning process. Throughout history, educators of all kinds have believed that experts are a key ingredient in producing such change. There is a growing body of research and experience, however, showing the significant impact of peers on change.One recent example is the work of Damon Centola at the University of Pennsylvania, who looked at the phenomenon of Oprah Winfreys Book Club. While it is easy to assume that sales of new novels were largely influenced by Oprahs endorsement, that proved not to be the case. Centolas (2021) research showed that book buying increased only when friends started recommending the book to one another.Work related to decision making also helped to shape The Backup Plan. According to research at the Bloomberg School of Health, older adults typically rely upon consultations with various family members to make health and treatment decisions (Dy & Purnell, 2012). Given the absence of family resources for Solo Agers, The Backup Plan borrows concepts from those who advocate for supported decision making on behalf of people who are developmentally disabled. Supported decision making is based on the belief that people can and should have the opportunity to make as many decisions as possible for themselves with appropriate support. It is a belief that can be extended to people who are not developmentally challenged (American Bar Association, 2020).Results of Pilot TestsSeveral nonprofit organizations in Minnesota have been trying out The Backup Plan model for nearly two years. In April 2022, participants in these groups gathered to connect with one another and to assess their experiences. During the gathering, participants were asked to chart their planning progress in six areas, including identifying a reliable emergency contact, creating an Advance Care Directive, and identifying at least one person/organization to serve as a decision supporter. Though accomplishments varied, all participants had made some progress. Most important, there was widespread agreement about the value in being part of a group.A few testimonials from participants:The groups provide a monthly kick in the butt.As I take steps I feel more in charge, feel less lost. (I may not get it all done, but I have a developing plan.)The loose but existing structure works for me.Coaches for the groups also were given an opportunity to comment on their experiences and had this to say:Training and materials were very adequategave a pretty good idea of what to expect, how groups would work.The model doesnt require professional facilitation skills/experience. The coach role workeddraw upon the group.Im amazed at the group that comes each month.Moving ForwardAs this article was being written, a second edition of the user guide and guide for coaches was available for wider distribution. The updated material is based on the experiences and feedback from the pilot groups. Also under discussion is the possibility of working with a local nonprofit that would recruit individuals interested in serving as coaches for organizations that wish to implement the model but are unable to assign a staff member to the coach role.If you are interested in making use of The Backup Plan model and materials, you may contact Linda Camp atthebackupplan2@gmail.com.Linda J.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2023The Community-as-Family ModelBy Wendl KornfeldJune 21, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingEconomic SecurityInnovation & Social ImpactAbstract:Community as Family (CAF) was developed in 2014 by Wendl Kornfeld. It is an educational model designed to encourage Solo Agers to anticipate and navigate their later years more efficiently, supported by a community-based team. There is no fee for coaching and training materials for those interested in becoming facilitators. The CAF structure is adaptable for Solo Agers regardless of location and cultures.Key Words:Community as Family, community-based, team, coaching, training, facilitatorsCommunity as Family is an educational and social model based on three principles: Anticipating and planning for the changes of later life; knowing how to access and use resources to maximum benefit; and creating a supportive team consisting of friends, colleagues, neighbors, and professionals.Common Question Sparks IdeaWhen my friends and Iall people without adult childrenwere in our 50s and 60s, we often shared stories about taking care of our older parents. Inevitably, the question, Whos going to do all this for us? came up and we agreed, Well do it for each other! However, a strategy was needed for this plan to become reality, thus the seeds of Community as Family (CAF) were sown.Early StepsIn 2014 five different focus groups of solo ager friends met over refreshments. We discussed what we were doing (or had done) for our aging parents and then imagined if someday wed be needing similar help for ourselves. If not, why did we think our circumstances would be different? If we did envision needing support, what was our plan? Almost no one had one; it was difficult to imagine ourselves being older or needing help, or maybe it was just too intimidating to think about. Participants left the meetings with basic forms and ideas to get the planning started and agreed they were relieved to find they werent alone in their apprehension about getting older without family help. They now understood the urgency of completing critical documents, keeping emergency information like contacts and important medical conditions on the refrigerator and in wallet cards, locating public resources, and building a personal support network.Community as Family Finds its First HomeRabbi Amy B. Ehrlich suggested bringing the focus-group model (subsequently named Community as Family) to Congregation Emanu-El in New York City. Single and coupled congregants ranging in age from late 40s to early 80s attended the first meeting in December 2014. The group has grown and has been meeting monthly ever since. Pre-COVID meetings included a light dinner at the temple; now meetings are via Zoom. A monthly newsletter is emailed to all CAF members, which includes a summary of the most recent meeting with links to relevant websites.A current member of the Emanu-El group reported, CAF has provided a wonderfuland probably uniquecombination of fellowship, fun, support, and extremely useful information. I joined the synagogue partially in order to become a member of this group. Timely topics are invariably presented and suggestions of additional topics are encouraged and well-received. I dont know how I ever managed without it!Almost no one had a plan; it was difficult to imagine ourselves being older or needing help, or maybe it was just too intimidating to think about.Said Rabbi Ehrlich, Our framework of monthly meetings focuses on articles of interest to our demographic, with a special emphasis on health, wellness, and vitality as well as pointing out things like the latest pervasive scams. Sharing information is a wonderful way to connect, break the ice, and continue to deepen a friendship. CAF has made it more comfortable for Solo Agers to participate in many temple activities, from worship to lectures to helping-hands projects, for the simple reason that they feel seen, which is a welcome and often rare affirmation in our demographic.Relationships Form and ThriveMany friendships have formed over the years, with members enjoying meals and cultural activities. They act as healthcare proxies for one another; volunteer, sit shiva, and attend services together. They pick up fellow members after medical procedures, share employment leads, help find new housing, or keep a set of keys for one another. One CAF member, who died a few years ago, had diligently implemented many of the CAF recommendations. She completed her essential documents, and arranged her end-of-life wishes. She was relieved to have made preparations that would give her and her survivors peace of mind.CAF Spreads Its WingsCommunity as Family has been widely publicized, including via a YouTube interview with solo aging pioneer Carol Marak; a LiveOnNY event at the New York Academy of Medicine; appearances at several New York City community-based organizations; and articles in blogs and newsletters. Every inquiry from individuals or other groups begins with a phone or Zoom interview to see how CAF might be adapted to work in their location and culture, with continuing consults as needed.Organizations are encouraged to choose a name for themselves. RSS, a senior center in the Bronx, NY, calls its group The Savvy Solos Club. Margie Schustack, director of communications & programs at RSS Center for Ageless Living explains, [We] found that there was a need to focus on individuals living alone. It started with a presentation to a large group in 2018 and then a smaller group began to meet regularly. The group provides support in developing a successful lifestyle for living alone through peer support, resources, and socialization. The pandemic caused a great deal of isolation, therefore, RSS continued Savvy Solos on Zoom to maintain connection with each other. Many felt it was a vital connection that kept them going through the pandemic. Presently the Club is offered in a hybrid modelwith some people on Zoom and others in our Center. It continues to bring new participants to the group and remains a core part of RSS's overall program.CAF Is Inclusive and AdaptableJudith Ribnick, LCSW, MA, is director of Aging Together at the Congregation Beit Simchat Torah (CBST) in NYC and notes, I was hired by CBSTthe worlds largest LGBTQ synagogueto create an Aging Together program to support isolated and older congregants through and beyond the pandemic. I immediately reached out [to Temple Emanu-El] to see how I could adapt their CAF structure for our community of over 1,000 individuals. Currently, Aging Together offers monthly presentations on pertinent topics, with relevant resources and a chance to meet one another in breakout groups. We also offer bimonthly Aging TogetherSolos meetups, as well as one-to-one telephone reassurance buddies, advance-care planning, a weekly socialization group, a quarterly newsletter, and case assistance provided by the director, who is a social worker.CAF Promotes Self-advocacy and SociabilityMeetings provide a way for people to see one another regularly, leading to supportive friendships. The educational component of CAF promotes self-advocacy through locating resources and understanding how to use them correctly. Forms and procedures are provided for organizing a medical history and a household handbook, a snapshot of how someones life is structured and runs, including passwords, memberships, serial numbers, document location, and much more.Organizations would do well to provide specially designed outreach to solo ager men.Community as Family can adapt to city or suburban environments and need not be connected to a spiritual center. The model can easily be adapted to small groups of friends or neighbors. While virtual meetings are worthwhile, there is a great benefit to having a comfortable, easily accessible physical space to meet, perhaps with refreshments, especially with the technical capability to present the meetings on a hybrid platform.The Importance of Strong FacilitationA strong facilitator is critically important, to keep the meetings focused and to ensure that everyone has a chance to speak and be heard respectfully. Confidentiality should be stressed, and some groups may decide to avoid politics unless the discussion is focused on how new or pending laws and bills will affect them directly. The facilitator, ideally, is a solo ager so they can speak from experience and empathize more closely. If there is a budget for professional speakers, or if pro bono speakers can be found, this will add value to the meetings.Not Every Group SucceedsNo one size, format, or methodology is a good fit for every community. For example, getting to a meeting place in an urban setting by local transportation can be relatively easy. But in a car-centric community, getting to a meeting is difficult for those who no longer drive or have no one to drive them. A group may fail to thrive by not reaching consensus about its purpose, expectations, and goals. One faith community in New Jersey had more than 40 people show up for the first meeting but strayed from the basic tenets of CAF. They tried (unsuccessfully) to accommodate too wide a variety of preferences. Some people hoped to learn how to be more proactive life planners, while others envisioned the group would be an immediate source of practical help for home and garden maintenance.A Call for More Diverse GrowthCommunity as Family welcomes inquiries from a wide palette of cultures and faiths, especially those that have traditionally relied upon family members to provide care and housing. Facilitator coaching and starter forms are offered at no charge, as are the consultations. The solo aging demographic is not restricted just to the United States. In 2018, Community as Family was honored to make a PowerPoint presentation to an international audience at a meeting of about 50 people at the Committee for the Ageing at the New York United Nations headquarters. A representative from one African nation declared she was going home to introduce the principles of CAF to her tribe.Wish ListWhile CAF principles focus on individual self-empowerment through knowledge and social connections, Solo Agers also need strong institutional partners. Some progress has been made: The Davis Financial Group in Hadley, MA, publishes The Soloist newsletter, and financial gerontology is an established field that addresses lifelong wealth-span issues, but there is so much more that could be adapted for Solo Agers. Suprenant and Beneski in New Bedford, MA, is a law firm focused on serving the needs of single elders. We hope more firms will follow suit. And actions the medical community might take to better serve Solo Agers could fill another article.While women seem to more naturally seek out and connect for friendship and advice, men need community just as muchespecially if they previously relied upon spouses or partners to organize their home lives and social connections. Organizations would do well to provide specially designed outreach to solo ager men and offer activities that are project-driven as well as social.ConclusionWhat professionals and lay leaders working with Solo Agers are doing now inspires thinking and planning for those future generations who will age into a world we cannot yet imagine.A December 5, 2022, New York Times article written by Paula Span, Who Will Care for 'Kinless' Seniors? concluded with this caveat for future generations of solos: However governments, community organizations and health care systems begin to address the issue, theres little time to waste. Projections indicate thatkinlessness will increase greatlyas the population cohorts that follow behind the baby boom age.Quoting sociologist Susan Brown, the article stated, Younger people are less likely to marry and have children, and they have fewer siblings How will they navigate health declines? We dont have a good answer. Im not sure people are paying attention.For more information on Community as Family, contact Wendl Kornfeld atwendlkornfeld1@gmail.com.Wendl Kornfeld (she/her) is a volunteer chair in the Community as Family model at the Congregation Emanu-El in New York, NY.Photo credit: Shutterstock/IndianFacesYou may also likeGenerations JournalWinter 202425Advocating for Grandparents Who Step in to ParentBy Alison BiggarGenerations JournalWinter 202425The Power of Strength: A Tribute to My Grandmother and All GrandparentsA Personal ReflectionBy Jean C.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2023Solo Aging and the Importance of Building a Local Support NetworkBy Carol MarakJune 21, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingInnovation & Social ImpactAbstract:This article explores the significance of establishing a local support network of friends and peers for solo agers, highlighting its potential benefits in addressing the social, emotional, and practical needs of this growing population.Key Words:support systems, support network, support team, socially active, relationships, friends, lonelinessWhen we are older, a strong support system is needed more than at any other time in life. Support networks are tremendously influential in our ability to age securely and confidently.The reasons for creating a support system extend beyond the need for social engagement and loneliness avoidance. Women, especially those without immediate family nearby, are at risk of isolating and spending too much time alone. Even women who have adult children nearby sometimes yearn for support, close bonds, and nurturance.Staying socially active enriches our daily experiences, and creating intergenerational friends keeps us young in heart and mind. We make friends with people because we like them. We have interests or experiences in common. They make us laugh. They make us feel special. And we can do the same for them.Scientists are starting to discover that having friends who care about us is a vital part of living. And it's a good predictor of robust health, success, and happiness (Harvard Health Publishing, 2017).Threat of LonelinessWell-regarded research from the National Academies for Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM; 2020) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Murphy, 2023) has suggested thatloneliness increases the risk of dying prematurelyas much as high blood pressure, smoking, or obesity. Vulnerable older adults, including immigrants; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) populations; people of color; and victims of elder abuse have higher risks of loneliness and tend to isolate more. NASEM suggests that immigrant and LGBTQ populations are lonely more often than other groups. Latino immigrants, for example, have fewer social ties and lower levels of social integration than U.S.-born Latinos (p. 87). First-generation immigrants experience stressors that can increase their social isolation, such as language barriers, differences in community, family dynamics, and new relationships that lack depth or history (NASEM, 2020).During the pandemic, many people reported feeling lonelier than ever. For people who identify as LGBTQ+, who already experience higher levels of loneliness, anxiety, and depression, being stuck at homeeither away from their chosen family and community, or with people who aren't accepting of their identitiestook a heavy toll.One young resident in the high-rise where I live confessed, Its not so easy to make friends here. You might think that friends are friends, who cares Im lesbian or not? Right now, Id accept any good friend that respects me. You may not be aware of it, but as a lesbian, we struggleway more than young gay men. Its because the term lesbian is taboo, as something awkward and shameful.Kathryn: Overwhelmed and with no support.Kathryn, age 65, for the first time in many years says she feels out of sorts. Although happy about a promotion at work, she was overwhelmed by all the new skills to learn although she had little doubt that she could perform the tasks. Her issue was that there was no one at home to vent to about her work worries. And no one to give her feedback. Having such little support puts more pressure on her. The stress makes her cry even at work. The tears are the manifestation of her fear and uncertainty, she claims. She felt guilty crying at work because its unprofessional, but she also had a hard time stopping. She feels alone and lost.Unfortunately, stories like Kathryns are not unique.Loneliness for adults has increasedover the past decades. Compared to the 1980s, the number of people living alone in the United States has increased by about a third. When Americans were asked about the number of people they can confide in, the number dropped from 3 in 1985 to 1 or 2 in 2004 (McPherson et al., 2006). In a 2018 survey, 39% of participants reported they are no longer close to anyone (Jackson & Ballard, 2018, para. 1) . In early 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murphy declared an epidemic of loneliness and isolation in the United Statesfurther evidence that rates of loneliness on a population level continue to increase.Furtherresearch(Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2013) on loneliness points to the need to change our perceptions of the world around us by changing our thinking. Heres how that translates for me: Its an inside job. It took years for me to get the concept of not taking things personally. When friends turned down my invitations, it wasnt because something was wrong with me, but perhaps they were busy. Those who arent lonely tend to realize this and, as a consequence, dont become despondent or start beating themselves up when someone says no to their invitations. When a person doesnt attribute failure to themselves, but rather to circumstances, they become resilient and can keep going.Katie: Becoming solo, grateful, and trying to focus on the positive.What I have is the present and maybe that's what I need to focus on: how do I use what time is left in this mortal world. At 77 I'm trying to make adjustments in outlook and attitude. So many questions about how I'll find safety and security. Not knowing if my money will last, and how I will maintain good health. It seems overwhelming. And, yes, it is compounded by the reality that I am alone. What I hope for the most are meaningful friendships and kindness from others.Perhaps at one point, a woman like Katie had a strong family unit but over time it lessened or evaporated. Children moved away or became estranged; spouses and partners separated, divorced, or died; and siblings lost touch or died as well. Single women often prefer living alone, but thats not to say they don't want and need help from friends and peers to share interests and activities, and even more, to have someone they trust for assistance, and to discuss problems and decisions.Older Couple: Needing help but none available.Amid a national shortage of home-care workers that deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, a couple in their late 80s spent much of this year on a private agency list, waiting to be assigned a professional home-care aide. But from April to August, no aides were available, leaving one spouse to carry the load on her own. Many nights are fraught with an hour-long bedtime routine that includes giving her husband pills and pulling on his Depends before tucking him into his recliner. Then she lies sleepless in bed.This story is increasingly common as the countrys shortage of home-care workers worsens, jeopardizing the independence of a generation of older Americans who had banked on aging in place rather than moving to a facility. One AARP poll showed that 77% of people older than age 50 want to remain in their homes (Davis, 2021), and other studies have shown aging in place can promote quality of life and self-esteem (Ahn, Kwon, & Kang, 2017). But the older couples dilemma of being unable to secure a home health aide reveals the risks when people are forced to go it alone.Build a Network of SupportThe U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee confirmed that older Americans are unlikely to have the level of support from family caregivers that they enjoyed in the past (2019). For many Solo Agers, the networks that will provide them with support in the future need to be crafted; we cannot assume they already exist.For me personally, determining where to start building a network of support was a dilemma. My friend and support networks had dwindled, and I found myself living in an isolated world with few people to connect with on a daily basis. I knew that I had to make a change.This type of situationgradually increasing loneliness and isolationare not a persons fault and need not be a source of shame. Once a person recognizes that they are feeling isolated and lonely, they can be well on their way to build the close new bonds they deserve.Why a Support Team Is NeededSocial support involves having a network of family, friends, and peers to turn to in times of need. A local support system is a key component of strong psychological health (American Psychological Association, 2022). Whether for immediate assistance during a personal crisis, or just to pass time with those who care, these relationships play a critical role in how a person functions day-to-day.In older age, this kind of support network may shrink, and the need for someone to do regular safety checks, bring food if sick, offer a ride to an appointment, and run errands when needed are things Solo Agers should think about and plan for. Being strong and independent is a worthy goal, but circumstances can change quickly when physical strength and health weaken, even if its for just a few days.How to Build a Support Team and Who Should Be on ItClose and caring relationships are undeniably linked to health and well-being at all ages. Onestudypresented a thriving model of support through close relationships. Researchers discovered a foundation for identifying the specific interpersonal processes that underlie the effects of close relationships on thriving, defined in the study as coping successfully with lifes adversities and actively pursuing life opportunities for growth and development (Feeney & Collins, 2015).The study outlined what an individual needs in order to thrive in older age:A focus on close relationships and face-to-face support approaches;A way to receive support and accept it as a practice of thriving, not just stress-buffering; andA way to understand that close relationships promote thriving and aging effectively.Research confirms that older adults who have a solid and dependable community of connections for support and friendship in the later years, will experience improved health and mental functioning (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). Those with meaningful relationships live 5 years longer on average than those who do not (Travers, 2020). Additionally, staying socially active and engaged in activities helps prevent depression (Alzheimers Association, 2023).Single older adults may need encouragement to make provisions for the times when support is needed. A few reminders such as the following will put them on the right path:Make a list of close friends and peers to call or textdont forget the neighbors, they are an integral part of a support system. If there is no one to put on the list, get out and make new friends. Go to places where peers hang out. Work through the awkwardness of meeting new people.Develop a personal plan of action. Research different activities in the local area, highlight favorite things to do, and make a schedule to attend them.Put together a hospital grab bag for an emergency.Share the support list of people with a team of neighbors and peers. Form a club, if you will, and get others involved and excited about joining.Be patient and kind. Forming new relationships takes time, even years. But it will happen. When I first moved to a high-rise building, the residents didnt talk to me straight away. But after two years, they began to open up, and at the end of years three and four, I began to receive invitations for coffee and dinner! It took a lot of effort and patience on my part, but today, my life is filled with many friends who live in the high-rise.Assess Your Social and Support Well-beingSocial connectedness (or the lack of it) can give you a place at the table or keep you out of the room altogether. Many years ago, I developed the following assessment to measure my own level of satisfaction for several domains, but this particular one addresses the social and support aspect. It uses a scale of 110, with 10 being the most satisfied. Daily social interactions Enjoyable activities Giving support Loneliness Perceived community Pet ownership Social integration Social network sizeEvaluate Your Support Community How easy is it to find someone to go on a trip for a day, have lunch out, or go to the movies? Is it difficult to find someone to say, Yes, Id love to! How easy is it to find someone to talk to about private worries and fears? If sick, how easy is it to find someone to help you with daily chores? Is there someone to turn to for advice about handling problems? If going out of town for a few weeks, would it be difficult to find someone to look after the house orapartment (the plants, pets, garden, etc.?) If stranded 10 miles from home, is there someone to call to come get you?The assessment tool can be used to help evaluate current social and support networks. Because if one doesnt know how to measure current status, how can one ever learn what, specifically, needs to change in order to resolve loneliness and low-level of supportiveness? Our goal as advocates for elders who might be lonely and isolated is to offer tools, resources, and unique ways to live that help them to make changes that enhance their lives.Now that weve established the need for building support and connection, we should help clients understand whats holding them back. If their concern is to avoid isolation and loneliness, teach them how to create a circle of friendships and close relationships and then, to be okay with asking for help.May each of us embrace that attitude of openness and willingness to try new things and broaden our circle of friendships.ResourcesAmeriCorps Seniors:800-942-2677;www.nationalservice.gov/programs/senior-corpsEldercare Locator:800-677-1116;eldercarelocator@n4a.org https://eldercare.acl.govAARP:888-687-2277 877-434-7598 (TTY);member@aarp.org;www.aarp.orgAlzheimer's Association:800-272-3900 866-403-3073 (TTY);info@alz.org www.alz.orgConnect2Affect:connect2affect.orgFamily Caregiver Alliance:800-445-8106;info@caregiver.org;www.caregiver.orgMeals on Wheels America:888-998-6325;info@mealsonwheelsamerica.org;www.mealsonwheelsamerica.orgLGBTQ individuals and families:find trained counselors, peer support, toolkits, fact sheets, and additional resources and information for individual support or about issues within the larger LGBTQ community.USAging:202-872-0888;info@uasging.org;www.usaging.orgNational Council on Aging:571-527-3900;www.ncoa.org/SilverSneakers:866-584-7389;support@silversneakers.com;www.silversneakers.comYMCA;800-872-9622;fulfillment@ymca.net;www.ymca.netCarol Marak is author ofSolo and Smart: The Roadmap for a Supportive and Secure Future(Carol Marak, 2022), speaker, and mentor.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2023Forget Me Not: Solo Agers, Too, Want to Be RememberedBy Mary Young and Allen DavisJune 21, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingInnovation & Social ImpactAbstract:As adults enter their later years, they begin to reflect upon past experiences, what they have learned from them, and what they want to pass on to the next generation. But many Solo Agers face a dilemma: Without a spouse and/or children to keep their memory alive, will they be forgotten? Without grandchildren, how can they share something of value with younger people? This article describes a variety of ways Solo Agers can create a legacy, whether financial or non-financial, and provides resources and tools to help Solo Agers, acting independently or with the support of organizations and professionals, to do so.Key Words:legacy, estate planning, financial planning, storytelling, family history, ethical wills, next generation, obituary, elder programsPhilosophers, religious thinkers, and psychologists all say essentially the same thing: As people reach their late 70s, they begin reflecting upon their legacy. They ask themselves howor even whetherothers will remember them. Some day soon there will be no one alive who has ever known me. Thats when I will be truly deadwhen I exist in no one's memory, wrote Stanford University psychiatrist Irvin D. Yalom (1989).Every stage of adulthood presents specific tasks, according to Gene D. Cohen, one of the most influential adult-development theorists of the 20th century (Argonon, 2013). By the time people reach their late 60s, they are drawn to reviewing their life and telling stories about it. They want to share the wisdom and lessons theyve learned. As they move into their late 70s, their task is to distill the major themes in their lives and consider whether, or how, they might have a positive impact on the world.Faced with the fundamental questionWho will remember me?parents and grandparents have an advantage. Their name may be passed on to younger family members. Their story becomes part of the next generations stories, helping them to better understand themselves.The Challenge for Solo AgersA Solo Ager cant assume their name and memory will survive, even for a little while. For some, this is simply the way things are. For many others, it becomes a nagging concern. Have I made any lasting contribution to the individuals and community around me? Who will remember these things and perhaps even pass them on to others? How soon will my name be spoken for the very last time?Fortunately, Solo Agers who are grappling with these questions can take steps now to ensure their names are remembered and their lives have, in fact, made at least a tiny difference. Moreover, they neednt have great wealth or influence to do so.What follows are examples of legaciesincluding financial or material possessions but placing greater emphasis on non-financial legaciesthat Solo Agers might leave and, in doing so, give meaning to their lives and be remembered. Individuals can do this on their own, but organizations and groups that serve elders, including senior centers, senior living communities, and faith communities can support Solo Agers by helping them engage with this work.Leaving a Financial or Material LegacyMany older adults worry that their living expenses may eventually outstrip their incomes and any other assets they may have set aside. A financial planner can provide strategies for addressing those concerns and, in many cases, ensure that something is left over to leave as a legacy.A financial planner often can help Solo Agers use financial instruments, including certain life insurance policies and types of annuities, to convert some portion of their financial assets to become a legacy. The $50,000 that might be sitting in a 401K account, for example, could turn into ten $5,000 gifts to support causes the Solo Ager cares about.For instance, an unmarried gay couple began working with a financial planner more than 20 years ago. While still in their 40s, each bought a life insurance policy so that if one of them died, the surviving partner could use the policys payout to make up for the deceased partners half of the mortgage and other shared expenses. The men are now in their 70s and each has enough retirement income and benefits such that they no longer need a backup to cover routine expenses. Consequently, one partner decided to revise his insurance policy and instead named as beneficiary the university where his interest in conservation had been nurtured. When he dies, the university will receive the face value of the insurance policy to support an annual seminar in forest conservation. Because he made these arrangements while living, he has the pleasure of attending the symposium and experiencing firsthand the legacy he created.One book collector gave treasured volumes to his friends, which sparked many memorable conversations.A financial planner also can help Solo Agers think about gifting other material assets they own. One book collector decided to give each of his treasured volumes to a friend or acquaintance who shared similar tastes. These gifts sparked engaging conversations, which, in turn, increased his feelings of connection. Donating a possessionfor example, a musical instrument, an unused vehicle, or even a home once a person no longer needs itto a deserving nonprofit isnt only a tax advantage. It may lead to new opportunities to become closely involved with the recipients.In this case, Solo Agers have an advantage over those with family. They are freer to choose beneficiaries because there are fewer assumptions about who those should be. Do they want to leave a parting gift to a sibling? Nieces and nephews? Cousins? Perhaps its someone unrelated: a neighbor; a long-time caregiver; or the brainy kid who delivered their newspaper, talked endlessly about the fish and amphibians he studied in a nearby pond, and will soon start college. A Solo Agers financial legacy also could benefit a group, organization, institution, or a cause they believe in.How Solo Agers Can Create a Financial or Material LegacyName a nonprofit as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy.Name one or more individuals, organizations, or institutions as beneficiaries of a retirement fund.Use an annuity to be distributed after death to individuals or organizations as endowments, scholarships, or annual gifts.Leave real estate to a charity or, in some cases, an individual.Give significant possessions to individuals who would value or use them.The laws and regulations governing personal finance can be complicated. Leaving a financial legacy requires advance planning and professional guidance. The Solo Ager who endowed the conservation symposium, for example, could do so because he had bought an insurance policy 20 years earlier. Once his financial needs changed, he had choices about whether and when to use it as a charitable gift.For many Solo Agers, leaving a financial legacy is not a possibility, which is why this article primarily explores other types of legacies. Money and possessions arent the only items of value Solo Agers can pass on. The most meaningful and personally rewarding legacies may lie closer to the heart. The next section describes how Solo Agers can clarify what legacy they can leave.Lessons from One Solos LegacyMiss Rumphiusis an award-winning childrens book, written and illustrated by Barbara Cooney (1982). It also is a charming story about one Solo Agers legacy. Miss Alice Rumphius lives with two cats and a cockatiel in a gingerbread cottage on the coast of Maine, where clutches of local children pay her visits. They come to see her treasures and listen to her stories about traveling as a young woman to tropical islands, jungles, and snow-capped mountains. And they come for her homemade cookies.When these children grow older, no doubt they will remember the intriguing old lady and her stories. Perhaps they also will remember what her grandfather said to her when she was their age, which she then shared with them. No matter where you go or what you do in your life, she said, you must do something to make the world more beautiful.But that wasnt Miss Rumphiuss only legacy. When she wasnt entertaining neighborhood kids or reminiscing, she wandered the pathways nearby, scattering lupine seeds.Those pink and purple lupines bloom year after year. Her friendships with young neighbors and the stories and lessons she told them probably also have a lasting impact. In fact, even the readers of her story benefit from her legacy as a positive model of solo aging, an alternative to the lingering stereotypes of cat ladies and old maids.Non-monetary gifts can convey a simple but compelling message: I was here. My life had meaning. Cooney may not have been thinking about that when she wroteMiss Rumphius. Yet the story affirms that non-monetary gifts can convey a simple but compelling message: I was here. My life had meaning. In my own small way, I had an impact on the world.This is the legacy that many late-life Solo Agers yearn to leave, and there are multiple ways they can do so.A Legacy Doesnt Have to Have Monetary ValueTo create a legacy that feels meaningful, givers first need to reflect upon what theyve learned from life, what they believe in or value, what they want to pass on.InEssential Retirement Planning for Solo Agers(2018), Guest Editor Sara Zeff Geber offers two worksheets that can help Solo Agers do this, either alone or in a group. The first worksheet asks them to reflect upon the tangible and intangible ways their lives have been blessed by what others have passed down to them. In the second worksheet, they record the legacies theyd like to leave.Contemplating the first set of questions might stir up unexpected memories: The reader might remember an elder who taught them, by example, how to live a vibrant life, no matter their age. Or think about the nest egg left by great-uncle Harry that paid for their high-school trip to Guatemala, which ultimately led them to become a Spanish teacher. They might feel gratitude for the camp counselor who got them excited about rock-climbing. Or the stranger sitting next them on a long flight who described what it had been like to start kindergarten not knowing a word of Englisha story that forever shaped their views on immigration. The second worksheet asks the reader to think about lessons and values they would like to pass on to others (and, more specifically, to whom?). As in the first exercise, a legacy can take any form: money, small gifts or mementos, stories and wisdom, emotional support, acts of kindness and caring. What matters is that its something meaningful.The final question is a critical one: What are some of the actions you can take or changes you can make that would help you create these legacies?How Solo Agers Can Create Non-Financial Forms of LegacyWritten messages such as an ethical will or personal lettersRecording their story on paper, video, or audio recordingPreserving their familys history through storiesWriting their own obituary and planning their memorial serviceMaking their actions their legacyWhile much of the advice on leaving a legacy automatically assumes that having children and grandchildren is the norm, Solo Agers can modify this advice to fit their own situations.Here are some low- or no-cost approaches to legacy-creation:Written or recorded messages:An ethical will is a document in which the writer sets forth their life lessons, values, and hopes to pass on to family members or friends. Speaking from the heart, the writer expresses personal feelings (love, pride, regret, apologies, even confessions), fondest memories, and wishes. It isnt a legal document but rather a meaningful gift to the living and perhaps even to future generations. Once written or recorded, it might get tucked away, to be shared at a time of the writers choosing, before or after death.Writing ethical wills was a common Judaic practice in the 12th Century, although it fell out of use until recently. Today everyone from psychologists to clergy and hospice programs recommends it as a rewarding exercise. Some estate attorneys and financial planners suggest that clients draft an ethical will before they choose any financial beneficiaries, as a way to reflect upon the values and experiences that have been most important in their lives.Preserving family history:Even if a person has no children of their own, they still can be the keeper and transmitter of family history. It is a powerful role that others in their family may not have time for or interest in. A Solo Ager who takes on this task is creating another kind of legacy that will be passed on.There are hundreds of ways to tell or preserve a story: talking around the kitchen table, narrating the pages of a photo album, sharing a recipe, teaching someone an old camp song or passing on skills. If someone is the only person who remembers fragments of family history, they can take action so these memories dont get lost. Even if others dont understand, someday someone will be grateful for what they did. This, too, can be part of their legacy.Writing an obituary, planning a memorial service:Rather than leaving these to chance, a Solo Ager can take matters into their own hands. They can sum up their life in a written obituary that includes the facts, experiences, and emblematic stories they would like people to know or remember about them. As long as they communicate this documents existence and where to find it, survivors will be grateful they wont have to dig up the information on their own.Solo Agers might also want to plan their own memorial service: who theyd like to give the eulogy, the readings (and who should read them), the setting, the music, even the flowers or objects theyd like displayed: the well-worn fedora that became a signature item, a hooked rug they were most proud of, the photos that tell their story. If the Solo Ager belongs to a religious community that adheres to a set liturgy, they can think, instead, about what theyd like to have as part of a reception afterwards.In one way or another, storytelling is at the heart of every one of these options. But that isnt the only way to leave a lasting mark. Solo Agers also can find ways to engage with the world through their relationships with other people.Making actions into legacy.Brad Aronson (2020) has written a wonderful book calledHumankind: Changing the World One Small Act at a Time. In it, he describes small acts of kindness that people have performed and the difference they have made, whether to one person, to a community, or to the larger world. It is unlikely anyone could read the book without thinking about how they, too, could make a difference.Barbara ShaimansLiving Your Legacy Now!(2009) is another excellent book that offers activities and strategies to help readers reflect upon their values and commit to living them, on a daily basis, in big and small ways.What Professionals and Organizations Can DoEvery older adult, solo or non-solo, needs encouragement and support to do this work, which is why elder-focused organizations (senior centers, councils on aging, religious communities, and senior living communities) and professions (estate attorneys, financial planners, aging life-care advisors, social workers, therapists, and clergy) have an important role to play.How Organizations and Professionals Can Support Solo Agers Legacy-CreationRecognize that life-review and legacy-creation are important tasks for older adults.Educate the elders being served by naming the issues and questions that often arise in later life.Support elders by helping them address these issues and identify actions they can take now.Build connections between generations, among participants in a legacy workshop, and between elders and the broader community.Name the names and celebrate the legacies of those who came before.The first step for organizations is to recognize that life-review and legacy-creation are important tasks for older adults. Those not familiar with adult-development theory can brush up on the psychological tasks that are typical when people reach their 60s, 70s, 80s, and older, because they are what make legacy-creation important.Working in pairs, the participants meet by Zoom or in person to ask questions about one anothers life and share experiences.Professionals can educate elders by naming these issues and questions as normal and legitimate concerns, even for people who dont have money or material goods to pass on, and for those who dont have children or grandchildren.Organizations and professionals can support elders by offering programs, discussions, workshops, and other activities to help them address these issues and identify actions they can take now. Virtually all of the suggestions offered previously to Solo Agers can be adapted to a group setting, such as a program focused on legacy or a workshop on specific aspects such as writing an ethical will.Building connections between generations, among participants in a legacy workshop, and between elders and the broader community is a great service that professionals and organizations can provide. For example:Northampton Neighbors(an affiliate of the Village Movement) partnered with an undergraduate public-health class at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst on a semester-long intergenerational storytelling project, which now has been repeated for several semesters. Working in pairs, the participants meet by Zoom or in person to ask questions about one anothers lives and share experiences. Some of these stories are recorded, with the partners consent, and are now housed in the StoryCorps archive at the Library of Congress (Northampton Neighbors, 2022).Foxfire was an experiential education program that got its start in southern Appalachia in the late 1960s. Secondary school students interviewed older residents in the region to learn from them about lost arts, local folklore, traditions, and crafts and the final write-ups were later published as a book. Other schools across the country developed Foxfire projects to document unique and disappearing phenomena in their local communities. No one called it legacy at the time, but that is clearly what this process of intergenerational connection was about (Wiggington, 1972).A more recent example is the oral history project run by the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, MA. Underwritten by a private donor, the program hires young people to interview and record eldersincluding, in some cases, their own relativesto collect personal perspectives on the changing nature of the Yiddish language and culture and Jewish identity.TheLegacy Projectsponsors a Listen to a Life competition, as well as other intergenerational storytelling programs. Contestants, who must be ages 8 to 18, interview a grandparent or grandfriend (note the inclusive language!) and write a 300-word essay based on their conversation. The judges are looking for an evocative, creative story that captures the essence of a persons life, or a critical moment or experience (Legacy Project, 2023, para. 8). The Legacy Projects website offers a wealth of interview questions and tips as well as winning essays and many recorded stories.Organizations can consider similar ways to remember those who are no longer among them. They can design an annual event where participants are invited to show photographs, light candles, share a memory, or simply speak aloud the names of those who are gone. The altars built for the Mexican Day of the Dead traditions and the Kaddish prayer for the dead in Judaism are just two examples. Participating in such a ceremony or ritual can be poignant but also comforting, as those who have gathered realize that someday, their names will also be remembered.Whenever people remember those who are gonewhether their parents, children, friends, or strangersthey cant help but engage in their own legacy work. Listening to others names and stories puts life into a broader context. It reminds people of the things that are passed on from person to person and encourages everyone to share their own gifts. Remembering those who are gone connects each individual to those who came before and those who will follow.These can be meaningful experiences for anyone. But for many Solo Agers, the assurance that they will be remembered, and the reminder that its not too late to shape their legacy, are particularly valuable.Mary Young holds a doctorate in organizational behavior.

        "full_text": "[URL]Generations JournalSummer 2023Shared Housing: Making a Golden Girls Home a RealityBy Annamarie PluharJune 21, 2023TagsAgeism & CultureHealth & Well-beingEconomic SecurityAbstract:Shared housing has many potential benefits for older adults including lower housing costs, companionship, and mutual help in managing daily life. Fear of a bad arrangement often stops elders from pursuing this option but if they can live according to four principles and learn how to screen for compatibility they can have a Golden GirlsHome. It can be fun and healthy to live with others.Key Words:Shared housing, housemate, home share, social connection, housing costsWhen Blanche, Rose, Sophia, and Dorothy became household names through the sitcom Golden Girls, they modeled for a generation the life of four women sharing a roof and all the laughs and fun they could have. Some Solo Agers want to duplicate a Golden Girls home when they think about their future. The show modeled camaraderie, laughter, community, and belonging. While it is not entirely reasonable to expect a life like what is portrayed by scripted professional comedians in a weekly sitcom, it is reasonable to want a living situation offering the community and belonging shown there. This provides a cushion of safety and eases the burden of paying for a life otherwise lived alone.Home sharing is a natural way to live. We are wired for living in a tribethis is how we lived for millennia. Living in close communities, our ancestors interacted daily with many people. Being alone, being solitary, was reserved for holy people or outcasts; it was not the day-to-day reality for most.Now we live in a world in which adults who are not partnered and are not parents are more likely to live alone than not. For older adults, according to the 2021 Profile of Older Americans, About 27% (14.7 million) of all older adults living in the community in 2020 lived alone (5 million men, 9.7 million women). The proportion living alone increases with advanced age for both men and women. Among women aged 75 and older, for example, 42% lived alone (Administration for Community Living, 2021).The consequences for individuals and our society are manifest. The epidemic of loneliness in the United States has been well-documented. Surgeon General Vivek Murphy, in his book Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World (2020), makes the case that this epidemic is a public health concern.It doesnt have to be this way. People can live with others. They can choose to join forces with one or more people to share housing and create the community they want. They say it takes a village to raise a child; we should also consider how being with others and having a community at home, can help in the later stages of life, too.People can live together. This is simple to say but takes effort to implement.Spending Less MoneyBecause home sharing can be a complex process, it helps to have a clear purpose in pursuing it. The benefits of shared housing need to outweigh the human tendency to accept the status quo and avoid change.Its the pain of housing costs that pushes most people down the path to shared housing. For Solo Agers, high housing costs, a lack of affordable housing, and low retirement income mean that many are cost-burdenedspending more than 30% of their income on housing. As Jennifer Molinsky (2022) of Harvard Universitys Joint Center for Housing Studies testified in the Senate, Over 10 million households headed by someone 65 and over are cost-burdened; half of these pay more than 50 percent.This is not too surprising. About 40% of all older adults are entirely dependent upon Social Security (Bond & Porell, 2020) for income and the average monthly Social Security benefit is $1,630.93 (Social Security Administration, 2023). Who is below that average? A study by the National Institute on Retirement Security found that people who are unmarried have less retirement income than married people, and Blacks and Hispanics have received less in in Social Security payments than Whites (Bond & Porell, 2020).When individuals choose to share housing their financial situation changes. The difference can be quite significant. As an example, a low rent of $500 a month amounts to an additional income of $6,000 a year for the householder, while for the home seeker a rent as low as $500 could mean the difference between being on the streets and being in housing. What the householder decides to charge is totally dependent upon their situation. Both home seekers and householders can benefit from reducing their housing costs. It can mean not having to choose between medicine and groceries, as too many low-income older adults must do now (Brandus, 2021).For some householders, renting out space in their home enables them to stay there. For others, the additional income provides a financial cushion. As Amy, a small-town librarian who shares her home said, I love the rent check! I put it in a separate accountits there as a safety nest.(Author note: All quotes not formally cited are from my blog,www.sharinghousing.com/category/real-people-sharing-housing.)She uses the extra money to treat herself to luxuries she couldnt otherwise afford, such as expensive restaurant meals and massages, and she also lets it accumulate. For Melissa, a special education teacher, the income from sharing covers the summer months when she doesnt receive a paycheck.Weve found a nice balance between being in touch and leaving space for each other.Sharing housing is not only about rent costs. Shared housing means sharing all the other utility expenses as well: water, heat, air conditioning, and internet.And while the pain of housing costs is the first reason a person might turn to shared housing, other benefits are significant.Feeling Less AloneWhile Amy is clear that the additional income is her main reason for sharing her home, she said, Its really nice having someone in the house. In the old days, I never minded coming home to an empty house; now I find that I like it that shes here. And while we dont look to each other to hang out or do things, theres a companionability. I dont know how else to say it. I simply feel less alone. We touch base, chitchat for a while if we feel like it. Usually, we meet in the kitchen. This daily exchange is grounding, kind of like family in a waybut without the stresses of family. Weve found a nice balance between being in touch and leaving space for each other.Exactly. I simply feel less alone. There is something about having someone else aware of one that is comforting. Or as one home sharer said, with a housemate around, It helps me get out of myself. Or another, Just having someone ask you How was your day? gives a little lift to the heart.Much has been written about the dangers of social isolation and loneliness, especially in people as they get older and are less able to make connections outside the house. Research has found that a lack of social contacts among older adults is associated with an estimated $6.7 billion in additional Medicare spending annually (Flowers et al., 2017).Another study showed, Social isolation and loneliness among older adults is a serious phenomenon affecting the fastest growing segment of the United States population. Causes of isolation are plentiful and well-documented, but a cure can be extremely elusive (Zinberg & Merino, 2020).People can live together. The housemate relationship is unlike living with a spouse, partner, or family member, with whom one has complex histories and interdependencies. A housemate is chosen for the express purpose of sharing a home. The relationship can be so independent that housemates pass as ships in the night, or it can become more familial. It all depends upon the people and the situation.Ideally, the relationship becomes one of a home-mate. A home-mate is a person you like and respect whose ways of living at home are compatible enough with yours that everyone is comfortable. It is unlike any other relationship a person can have. A home-mate is not family, nor spouse, nor partner. A home-mate is not a best friend. A home-mate can have a completely independent life. It is a mature housemate relationship.Sharing Household DutiesHousemates have the benefit of sharing the work of maintaining a home and a life. Couples and families help each other all the time, divvying up the work associated with having a home. Maintenance tasks of everyday life such as taking out the garbage, vacuuming, and dusting can be shared. A housemate can be asked to pick up soup when one is sick with the flu or to feed a cat for the weekend. Having a housemate at home allows for a release from the hospital after a procedure. There is also the comfort of knowing that if there is an accident, a housemate will know about it. There are all sorts of ways that having a housemate can make life easier.Sharon Khas story is on the extreme end of the spectrum. One day she realized she could no longer live alone. When she was diagnosed with Parkinsons, she thought, Either I find someone to come live with me to help, or I need to go into assisted living. She decided to look for someone. Concurrently Deborah Knox was contemplating how she could live rent-free and get out of debt. They found each other through their networks and have now been living together for 5 years. They are so delighted with their arrangement that they are working on making it more available in Tucson where they live (seeTucson HomeShare).There are home-share match programs that specifically arrange for an exchange of work for reduced housing costs. This works very well when an older person who has room in their home needs some help to do tasks that used to be easy, such as driving, shopping, or snow shoveling.Some housemates choose to have meals together and thus share the work of shopping, cooking, and cleaning up. How often they eat together and how they manage it will depend upon what they wantfrom eating all evening meals together to doing so once a month and everything in between. It depends on what the home-mates decide.Promoting SustainabilityChoosing to live with others is a decision to live sustainably. Two or more people under one roof means they are using less of the worlds resources for heating and cooling and keeping the lights on. It also means that they can combine stuffall those things which we consider necessary for a modern life, such as coffee machines, toasters, microwaves, vacuum cleaners, blenders, irons, and ironing boards. No need for two sets of living room furniture or multiple pots and pans. How housemates manage this stuff, from big furniture to forks and knives, is part of the discussion on how to live together. It depends upon the desires and needs of the housemates.Mutually Beneficial GivingThe benefits of cost, companionship, mutual aid, and sustainability would be enough on their own. But there is another consideration that, though theoretical, seems to resonate with lived experience. Whole person health is the idea that as humans we exist to give and to receive. This is universal: All religions teach the importance of giving to others. It is the reciprocity of giving and receiving that enlivens us and makes us feel good. When multiple people live under one roof, it is easy to have a regular cadence of helpfulness and participation. But when we dont have that, something inside shrivels up and causes pain. When we do for another, we are the beneficiaries.Two or more people under one roof means they are using less of the worlds resources for heating and cooling and keeping the lights on.These five benefits together make a compelling case for people to home share. When housemates grow into home-mates they can have the benefits of saving money on housing, having a spontaneous social connection, mutual help in maintaining a home, sustainability, and whole person health all of which lead to the comfort of belonging to a small community, a Golden Girls home.Some wonder about sharing a home but dont take action because either they dont know how to go about it, or they feel that it is too risky.Concerns About Home SharingSadly, weve become a society that fears the stranger rather than welcoming them. While all major religions have injunctions to show strangers hospitality, in our world weve developed what Dr. George Gerbner in the 1970s called the Mean World Syndrome. His research revealed that people may perceive the world to be more dangerous than it is, due to long-term moderate-to-heavy exposure to violence-related content on mass media (Gerbner et al., 1980). And that was before the Internet! We are now a society steeped in stories of violence and harm, accounts that work on us unconsciously. One consequence is that people perceive shared housing as scary and high-risk rather than warm and caring.The biggest worry is the nightmare housemate who makes home life miserable. Nightmare housemates are always the result of an incomplete, ineffective, or nonexistent selection processes. Householders can learn how to flag and reject the nightmare housemate during the selection process. To do so effectively takes having clear requirements for a housemate, trusting ones inner wisdom, and not overruling it. This is not rocket science. Competent adults have navigated many other crucial life decisions. The key is knowing how to conduct a housemate interview process and noticing any red flags.When asked about how a bad housemate happened, people will say, He seemed nice enough, She was my niece, or I was uncomfortable about something in the interview and thought I could handle it. Those situations are all indicative of an incomplete or nonexistent selection process.Another obstacle to home sharing is a worry about losing privacy. Its true, sharing a home isnt the same as walking through the front door and knowing you are alone. Privacy is found in ones own space. A shut door is a signal that says, Do not bother me. Many people can live with that level of privacy. People living in shared housing talk about the pleasure of coming home to a house with lights on and company, rather than being alone.What does it take to live well with others? There are four principles to guide us.Four Guiding Principles to Living Well with OthersThe first one isThe Golden RuleDo unto others as you would have them do unto you. With home sharing, this means being willing to compromise and adapt behavior for the comfort of others in the home. This principle assumes that the interviewing process would have found any irreconcilable conflicts before agreeing to live together. Small adaptations are natural.The second principle is,Do it while its easy.This is a communication skill, to speak up about a little annoyance before it becomes a big nightmare. It is much easier to say something early on, before it spirals out of control.Michelle said, This is a really silly thing. Our housemate was given permission to use our stuff in the kitchen, but I found that every time I wanted to use a particular thing it wasn't where it belongs because she was using it. It took me a while to say something, and I just felt myself getting annoyed. I finally said something about it, and she went out immediately and bought her own since she realized she liked it so much. Often speaking up allows for a minor adjustment and everyone is comfortable.The third principle isYour room is your own.Always. In shared housing, there should be no reason why anyone would be in the housemates personal space. This is how privacy is maintained.The fourth isthe incest taboo. This is really important. Housemates are like family. Good housemates can become intimate friends, but if housemates sleep together the relationship changes. A fewvery fewsettle into a long-term relationship. More often, the expectations about what sex means to the relationship differ and the ensuing unhappiness means someone has to move out of the home. Its preferable to ensure that housemates are off-limits by laying down the rule at the outset.These four principles are all that is needed to live well with others. But how does a Solo Ager who wants to live in shared housing find others with whom they can share?Creating Shared HousingJust as there is a large variety of types of homes, there are many ways to create shared housing.The most common shared housing arrangement is for the householder to decide to rent space in their home. This arrangement is also the easiest to set up and get going. There are householders who simply do this on their own.Others turn to programs that help by offering to match the householder with a home-seeker. There are home-share social service agencies that have a formal application process. They do the screening of potential housemates, including background checks and the initial interview. When they see a potential match, they introduce a householder to a home seeker and help negotiate the housemate agreement. The National Shared Housing Resource Center offers a list of theseprograms. There are not enough of them.There are online web-based matching services that allow for householders to list their rental where potential housemates can find them.SilvernestandNesterlyare for-profit ventures.Senior HomeShareis a nonprofit organization. One issue for all the online matching services is that there have to be enough people in a specific geographical area to be useful for the user.Feliz Tanga and her husband created shared housing as small investors.Sharing Housing, Inc., is working to empower adults to find their own housemates by providing education in how to do a selection process. A pilot program,SHIFTShared Housing Incentives for Taking Actionis a project in the southeastern counties of Vermont. Focused on homeowners, it offers a cash incentive to help homeowners make their home more comfortable for sharing. It combines education through online minicourses, a home visit, and support services for the housemate search and decision.Two or more people under one roof means they are using less of the worlds resources for heating and cooling and keeping the lights on.Buying or Renting with FriendsBuying or renting a home with friends to move in together is another variation on home sharing. Thats what Nicky did. She bought a house with her friend Mary. At the time, Mary was living in a home that was becoming too much to manage and Nicky needed a place to live. Both of them were pre-retirement age and divorced. Said Nicky, The time was right, and we had the opportunity to do it. They realized that by pooling their resources they could afford a better house with space for all of their needs, plus some disposable income left over. Owning a home together was a win-win!They now own a large house in the suburbs of their metropolitan area. They have adapted it to their needs with a caretaker apartment on the ground floor should they need that in the future. Currently, they rent that apartment and have a third housemate in the big house. Nicky said, When people share housing, it should be a move up to compensate for the loss of autonomy. Here, everybody feels like theyre getting a win. This house is better than what we had alone.Karen Bush, Louise Machinist, and Jean McQuillin bought a house together. Their book,My House, Our House: Living Far Better for Far Less in a Cooperative Household(2013) details how they found the house and what agreements they made to ensure everyone was comfortable.Creating a Home-Share HouseCreating shared housing as a small investor is what Feliz Tanga did, with her husband. They own a six-bedroom ranch house with three bedrooms upstairs and three bedrooms downstairs. It has a ramp to the front door. There are three bathrooms, two kitchens, and two laundry rooms all on one floor, with a full basement with egress windows (large enough to use to leave the building in case of a fire). They explored setting it up as an assisted-living house but found the regulations too onerous. Instead, theyve created a home-share house for five women ages 55 and older. The sixth bedroom is a guest room. One of the bathrooms has a walk-in shower, and all the bathrooms have grab bars.The women who live in the house are screened by Tanga. For a new person to move into the house, all current residents have to meet the potential new housemate and agree to living with her. There is a 6-month trial period. As that period is ending Tanga will call each resident to ask if the housemate should be allowed to stay. If any one person says no the housemate is asked to move out. These are smart policies to ensure that the home is comfortable for everyone. (For more on this topic, seeInvest in Shared Housing (How Jude Does It)by A. Pluhar, 2018).Any of these methods for creating a home that is shared can result in a Golden Girls home. The outcome depends upon the people involved and the relationship they develop. The key is that they are compatible enough in how each person uses their home and that they like and respect one another. It doesnt happen immediately. Like any relationship, it grows.Organically Developing a Home ShareThis story illustrates the organic development of a home share.Jennifer said, I met Abigail at a business event. We clicked instantly and discovered we were both planning on going to a conference that was out of town. Because I was late in registering for the conference, I wasn't able to book a hotel room, so I was planning on commuting from home. Abigail said, Come share my room, and I said, Ill bring the wine.\"We ended up chatting all night. At the time I was living in a large four-bedroom house, my last child was moving out, and I was just going through a divorce. Abigail was in the early stages of separation and divorce. I said, You will have a tough year, I've been there. Im happy to listen and if you ever need a place to get away, just feel free to come to my house. The key is under the propane tank.The friendship developed. Jennifer said, I invited her to move in, knowing that in the first year of marital separation managing finances can be difficult. I thought, Ive got space, why not share it? They lived together for 4 years, including moving to a smaller house together.Notice the cadence of offer, acceptance, and reciprocity. Jennifer and Abigail clicked when they met. Abigail then offered to share her hotel room. Jennifer reciprocated by offering her home as an escape and then as a home. The first offer was a risk that was time-limited. If it didnt work out it would be short-lived. Then Jennifer made an open-ended offer to use her house. Abigail might not have followed up on it, but she did. That laid the foundation for the ensuing home-mate relationship. This is how good relationships developthrough a cascade of reciprocal offers and acceptances. It requires being open to what is possible.AGolden Girlshome develops over time. It is not instantaneous. Whether they first meet each other through community networks and personal efforts or through matching programs, it takes time to grow into the comfort and ease depicted in Golden Girls. It is an excellent solution for Solo Agers. A good home share provides community and belonging that enlivens the spirit and brings joy to life. It is nice to see the lights on when coming home.Annamarie Pluhar, MDiv, founded and is president of the nonprofit Sharing Housing, Inc. The organization advocates for and provides education in how to implement shared housing for professionals and individuals.
