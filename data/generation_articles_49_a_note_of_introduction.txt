[URL]Generations JournalSpring 2024A Note of IntroductionBy Tobi AbramsonApril 24, 2024TagsHealth & Well-beingAgeism & CultureDear Readers,It has been my privilege to guest edit this issue ofGenerations JournalonMental Health, Aging, and Resilience.When asked why this topic matters, one need only think about the growth of the aging population and the anticipated increase in the number of older adults who will need, utilize, and benefit from mental health services. Older adults are resilient and can continue to grow and thrive. They have so much to offer, so much to teach us, and there is so much we can learn from them. Weas professionals who have chosen to work in this fieldhave the responsibility to support older adults as they live their best and fullest lives.As a psychologist who has spent much of my career focusing on the mental health of older adults, I am always reminded that mental health lies at the core of living a full and rich life. Especially as one ages. Yet, the literature focuses largely on psychopathology and available interventions to treat these psychopathologies. While such articles are crucial for those working in the mental health field, we also need to shift our way of thinking and embrace a strengths-based perspective that reflects resiliency and growth. As mental health professionals, we have the opportunity to build our mental health toolkit to include strategies that foster and cultivate resiliency as our clients engage in mental health services.This issue ofGenerations Journaldoes just that. It shifts the narrative and encourages you, the reader, to consider the strengths and resilience of older adults and the innovative tools and approaches that can build our mental health practice.Each author was asked to frame their articles with resiliency in mind. What follows is a brief snapshot of these articles. The journal opens withmy articlewithPamela Braverman Schmidt, The Cultivation of Psychological Resilience as an Older Adults Superpower, which frames the dimensions and underlying factors of psychological resilience and the tools that can be used when working therapeutically to cultivate resiliency as a catalyst for positive change.

Brownin their article, Post-Traumatic Growth and Aging.These authors shift how we generally think about trauma even further as they focus on positive change and growth as an outcome of adversity.Resiliency really is an older adults superpower.'Mental health help is often underutilized by older adults due to myriad barriers, including mental health literacy.Kim Williams and Lisa Fursts article, Mental Health Literacy among Older Adults: What Do We Know, and What Can We Do?highlights the importance of addressing literacy and developing literacy plans.Tracey Gendronspiece, The Impact of Ageism on Elders Mental Health,addresses the pervasive impact ageism can have on an older adults mental health and the importance of addressing this prejudice in creating a more inclusive and mentally healthy society built upon strengths and not stereotypes.A growing body of evidence supports the feasibility and effectiveness of task sharing in the mental health field.Patrick RaueandKianna Seresinhesarticle, Mental Health Task Sharing: Training Volunteers, Peers, and Interns,addresses this via their innovative model, Do More, Feel Better.Older adults who have been a victim of abuse or crime often struggle with acting on safety strategies.Jo Anne Sirey, Isabel Rollandi, andClare Culversarticle, Connecting Crime and Abuse Victims to Mental Health Services,is practice-based, and covers the importance and value of connecting crime and abuse victims to mental health services.The mental health needs of three groups of older adults with layered marginalitiesundocumented immigrants, those with serious mental illness, and those with intellectual disabilities, are complex and the focus ofMarcia G.
