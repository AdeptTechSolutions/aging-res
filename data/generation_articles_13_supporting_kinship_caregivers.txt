Day, John Fowler, Cheryl Miller, and Geene DelaplaneFebruary 05, 2025TagsEquity & JusticeInnovation & Social ImpactAbstractThis article describes Washington States efforts to understand and support the needs of kinship caregivers through cultural adaptations, focusing on tribal and Latine communities. The states Kinship Navigator Program history is described, as well as its statewide Pro-Active Equity Anti-Racism framework. Caregivers may be directed to local services, which can include: financial resources, emergency assistance funds, support groups, basic needs & clothing, summer respite resources, school/youth activities, and legal/custody resourcesKey Wordskinship caregivers, Kinship Navigator Program, tribal communities, Latine communities, Area Agency on Aging, Pro-Active Equity Anti-RacismIn recent years, Washington State has taken significant steps to understand and support the needs of kinship caregivers through cultural adaptations, particularly for people from Latine and tribal communities. Starting with a history of the Kinship Navigator Program in Washington State, we will look at what it means to use a statewide, Pro-Active Equity Anti-Racism framework. By examining different data sources, including the Healthy Youth Survey, we can delve into practical service-level and cultural adaptations that will be helpful for tribal and Latine communities.The Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) places children with kinship caregivers 54% of the time (DCYF, 2023). The vast majority of kinship caregivers care for children without the involvement of the child welfare authority, also known as informal kinship care (as opposed to formal care arranged by the child welfare authority). Nationally, just 133,873 children are placed in formal relative foster care placements, representing less than 5% of all kinship children (Childrens Bureau, 2022).In Washington State, more than 40,000 young people currently live with a grandparent rather than a parent (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2021). Grandparents and other kinship caregivers in Washington State frequently have lower income levels and rely upon fixed incomes, leading them to struggle to financially support the youth in their care (Day et al., 2020).All kinship care providers are eligible for some public supports, such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family (TANF) Child-Only Grant, which provides government funds for children in kinship care, and the Kinship Caregivers Support Program (KCSP), available only to informal kinship care families, which provides state funding for basic needs on a short-term basis. Day et al. (2020) pointed out that these financial supports are often less than those provided in Washington State to foster parents. Many kinship care providers also are not aware of these supports or struggle to access available resources.Washington State Kinship Navigator ProgramSince 2005, kinship navigators have supported formal and informal kinship caregivers, starting with two pilot sites and now serving every county through the state-funded program. Kinship navigator projects were designed to help kinship families navigate the service system by offering information and referral, advocacy, and support. Kinship navigators are experts who help kinship caregivers by providing information and support. Kinship navigators can connect caregivers with valuable services in the community. They serve all counties in the state, while seven tribes participate with tribal navigators serving their respective tribes.ALTSA partners with the 13 local AAAs to provide kinship navigator services.Each of the kinship navigator programs serve the catchment area of their Area Agency on Aging (AAA), giving kinship navigators and their tribal counterparts a community understanding because they are members of these communities. The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services Aging and Long-Term Support Administration (ALTSA) works intentionally to help build trust between these communities and local and state government by connecting with local services providers who live in the community. This way, families may feel safer engaging in services and using resources. Caregivers may be directed to local services, which can include:Financial ResourcesEmergency Assistance FundsSupport GroupsBasic Needs & ClothingSummer Respite Resources School/Youth ActivitiesLegal/Custody ResourcesWashington States Kinship Navigator Program is run by staff at ALTSA. The ALTSA kinship team consists of the kinship and lifespan respite program manager and a fidelity analyst. ALTSA partners with the 13 local AAAs to provide kinship navigator services. Some of the AAAs choose to keep those services in house, and some subcontract with local service organizations to provide kinship services. While the ALTSA team oversees the program, each individual program is responsible for hiring and supervising their kinship navigator employees and their day-to-day operations. Some of the AAAs and/or their subcontractors recognized the need to hire Spanish-speaking bilingual staff to serve monolingual Spanish-speaking caregivers in their communities.Pro-Active Equity Anti-RacismOn March 21, 2022, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee established the Pro-Active Equity Anti-Racism (PEAR) framework to address the exclusion, marginalization, and oppression of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) with low income, immigrants and refugees, people living with disabilities, and other groups. Such injustices have resulted in deeply entrenched educational, economic, and health inequities. It is within this PEAR framework that both DCYF and ALTSA support kinship caregivers. The PEAR framework is built on five core strategies:Implementing the PEAR Framework: Agencies work in partnership with communities and organizations to address implicit and explicit biases and all levels of racism, focusing particularly on the experiences of BIPOC.Embracing Continuous Improvement: Agencies are encouraged to build capacity for continuous learning and improvement, ensuring that policies and practices evolve to sustain equitable outcomes.Assessing Equity Impact: Agencies are required to understand and evaluate the impact of their policies and actions on equity, using this understanding to guide decision-making and policy adjustments.Making Data-Informed Investments: Agencies should identify root causes of disparities and prioritize investments that address these gaps, benefiting those who traditionally have been excluded.Ensuring Transparency and Accountability: Agencies must maintain a long-term commitment to equity, using data-driven decision-making and tracking outcomes to build public trust and accountability.ThePEAR Plan & Playbookoutlines tools and strategies for creating a PEAR ecosystem in Washington State, ensuring all residents have access to the opportunities and resources needed to thrive. Informed by data including the Healthy Youth Survey, the PEAR framework also determines trends, including those within BIPOC communities, to help inform the work we do.Healthy Youth SurveyThe Healthy Youth Survey (HYS) is a biennial survey that has been conducted in Washington State since 2002. It assesses various risk behaviors among 6th to 12th graders, including substance use, injury-related behaviors including carrying a weapon, food and physical activity habits, mental health, school climate, and protective factors. The survey provides crucial insights into adolescent health and well-being.Key stakeholders, such as state, local, and tribal public health agencies, county prevention coordinators, and community coalitions, use HYS data to inform policies and programs that benefit youth. Approximately 7 years ago, ALTSA collaborated with HYS to include a survey question about living situations. This allows stakeholders to analyze risk behaviors among youth in kinship care and foster homes.Because we have data-driven insight, we recognize that young people of color are more likely to experience multiple out-of-home placements, less likely to be reunited with their birth families, and more likely to experience congregate care. Prioritizing kinship care for young people of color is important for establishing permanency, reducing entrance into foster care, and ensuring that cultural and community ties are maintained (DCYF, 2020).Tribal CommunitiesIndigenous grandparents are overrepresented in kinship caregiving systems; they are 3 times more likely to be kinship caregivers than the general population (Day et al., 2024).Day et al. (2024) reported that Indigenous kinship caregivers feel judged by social workers who do not know their history, such as the traumatic impact of American Indian boarding schools and the resulting trauma they have created. Such historical trauma can cause many Indigenous families to distrust mainstream, non-tribal services offered to American Indian grandparents (Day et al., 2024). The tribal Kinship Navigator Program provides opportunities to reinforce a childs sense of cultural identity and self-esteem through continued family connection.The Office of Indian Policy works statewide to help solve the collective needs of tribal governments and Recognized American Indian Organizations to assure quality and comprehensive program service delivery from the DSHS to all American Indians and Alaska Natives in Washington state. The ALTSA Tribal Affairs unit is committed to partnering with tribes in Washington to achieve mutual goals between sovereign governments.Latine kinship caregivers face distinct obstacles, including language barriers, lower incomes, and higher incidences of unmet medical needs for children in their care.Delivering comprehensive, culturally appropriate services can be achieved by developing partnerships with tribes and Recognized American Indian Organizations, existing Long-Term Services and Support partners, and providers such as state and local government and private contractors. They provide cultural outreach to Tribal members to ensure that trusted members of the community deliver information.The ALTSA Tribal Affairs unit also coordinates the biannual Money Follows the Person Tribal Summit. In Washington, the Money Follows the Person program, known as Roads to Community Living, has always been an inclusive service providing pathways to home for anyone who was living in a facility. The Initiative focuses on developing inclusive service contracts and engaging potential partners at the state, tribal, and county levels for improved and culturally inclusive service delivery of ALTSA services, including tribal contracted support services.Tribal Kinship Navigator ProgramThe Tribal Kinship Navigator Program was funded in 2016 through the Washington State legislature. The program serves grandparents and other relatives (kinship caregivers) who are raising children because their parents are unable to do so. The DSHS Aging and Long-Term Support Administration is committed to partnering with tribes in Washington to achieve mutual goals between sovereign governments. Funding is available for seven of Washington States 39 federally recognized tribes to run a kinship navigator program. Currently, seven Tribes are partnering with ALTSA to run the tribal Kinship Navigator Program in their communities to meet the specific needs of their tribal kinship caregivers in a culturally mindful manner.Tribal Kinship Navigators serve as a one-stop shop, providing resources, assistance, problem-solving, and emotional support to kinship caregivers who are overwhelmed and do not know where to turn for support. Caregivers often need help to apply for benefits and to learn what services are available related to financial needs, healthcare, educational advocacy, counseling, legal help, and other needs. They also act as advocates and assist these families with resources for housing, support groups, urgent need funds, and continuing connections with their tribal community.Through the Tribal Kinship Navigator Program in 20222024, 612 kinship caregivers and 808 children received 3,143 tribal navigator assistance contacts.Currently seven tribes have Kinship Navigators Programs:Confederated Tribes of the Colville ReservationLummi TribeMakah TribePort Gamble SKlallam TribeQuileute TribeSamish TribeYakama NationStarting in 2020, the Port Gamble SKlallam Tribe worked with evaluation researchers from the University of Washington School of Social Work to develop and implement a tribally adapted needs assessment to use with kinship families. All caregivers who participated in a focus group and survey reported that their kinship navigator helped them obtain extracurricular activities/summer programs (Day, 2022). Additionally, 75% reported obtaining support with financial assistance, school-related support for their kinship child, and respite. Overall caregivers had a positive perception of their kinship navigators and the various services they accessed through the program, and they expressed high satisfaction (Day, 2022). ALTSA staff connect regularly with tribal kinship navigators at quarterly statewide meetings, new staff onboarding, and yearly at the Washington Tribal summit.Latine CommunitiesStatewide Survey and Its ImplicationsTo gain a deeper insight into the challenges faced by kinship caregivers, Washington State conducted a statewide survey from 20192021, using a sample of 736 kinship caregivers (Gmez et al., 2024). Most of these kinship caregivers identified as women (89.8%). The mean age of the sample population of kinship caregivers was 58.9. Based on self-reporting for ethnicity (n = 60) Latine kinship caregivers and (n = 676) non-Latine kinship caregivers participated in this mixed-method exploratory survey. This initiative aimed to capture the experiences and needs of caregivers, providing a robust data set to inform policy and program development. The survey revealed critical areas where support was most needed, particularly for Latine caregivers who reported unique challenges compared to their non-Latine counterparts.Kinship Navigator ProgramsA cornerstone of Washington States support system for kinship caregivers is the Kinship Navigator Programs. These programs are designed to help caregivers access necessary services and navigate the complexities of legal and mental health issues. For many caregivers, these programs offer invaluable assistance in managing the multifaceted demands of their roles. However, despite these efforts, economic hardships and immigration-related challenges continue to pose significant barriers.Addressing the Needs of Latine CaregiversLatine kinship caregivers face distinct obstacles, including language barriers, lower incomes, and higher incidences of unmet medical needs for children in their care. Washington States survey highlighted these disparities, underscoring the need for more targeted support. While Kinship Navigator Programs provide crucial aid, there is a recognized need for more Spanish-speaking providers and services tailored to the specific circumstances of Latine families.Economic and Social SupportThe states support framework includes various forms of economic and social assistance. These measures are vital in alleviating some of the financial pressures faced by kinship caregivers. However, the survey also identified ongoing challenges, such as access to medical care and the need for consistent and adequate financial assistance.Recommendations for Enhanced SupportBased on the survey findings, several recommendations have been proposed to enhance support for kinship caregivers in Washington State:Increase Spanish-Speaking Providers: Expanding the availability of Spanish-speaking health and service providers to meet the needs of Latine caregivers.Enhance Financial and Social Support: Providing more robust financial assistance and social support to alleviate the economic burdens faced by many caregivers.Sustainable Kinship Navigator Models: Developing sustainable models for Kinship Navigator Programs that effectively address the specific needs of Latine families.Address Systemic Issues: Focusing on systemic issues such as documentation challenges and employment opportunities can further support kinship caregivers in their roles.Current Cultural AdaptationBased on this survey of Latine kinship caregiver families conducted by Dr. Angelique Days research team from the University of Washington, its findings, as well as what kinship navigators have found in the field have shaped their approach to working with kinship families. Hiring Spanish-speaking kinship navigators has been a critical step to supporting monolingual Latine kinship caregivers families. Nonnative Spanish speakers continue to take classes to keep up and learn new skills. Navigators translate paperwork into various languages to make information accessible.Kinship navigators participate in outreach, specifically targeting Latine kinship caregivers including radio and community events in the Latine community. The Legal Advice and Referral for Kinship Care (LAARK) program offers legal advice in different languages; it also can offer support or referrals to other organizations to help kinship care families deal with legal issues, including concerns about immigration status for caregivers, or the children for whom they care.ConclusionWashington States commitment to understanding and supporting kinship caregivers, especially in the Latine and tribal communities, is evident through its comprehensive survey and targeted programs. While significant progress has been made, ongoing efforts and tailored interventions are necessary to fully meet the diverse needs of kinship caregivers across the state. Through continued focus on these areas, Washington State aims to provide a robust support system that can adapt and respond to the cultural needs of kinship families.
