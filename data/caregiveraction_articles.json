Its a federal law that may protect your job and health insurance for up to 12 weeks per year while you take time off to care for a family member with a serious health condition.All public employers and private employers who employ at least 50 workers are required to offer FMLA to their employees who have been employed there for at least a year and worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to the start of leave. The only down-side to FMLA is that the leave is unpaid.State-sponsored Paid Family LeaveHappily, FMLA allows states to expand on the federal law. And some states have, offering up to 12 weeks of Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) to many residents. The benefit amount you can receive while on PFML varies by state and your work circumstances.Currently 11 states plus Washington, D.C. offer PFML, with four more states enacting PFML laws in 2026. You can learn about your states family leave laws on RubyWellsFamily Leave Finder.Employer-sponsored Paid Family LeaveJust under30%of employers in America offer paid family leave as an employee benefit, whether or not the state you live in offers PFML.If youre lucky enough to work for one of these employers, ask your HR department if theres a paid family leave benefit that you can take advantage of. The employer benefit may be more generous than the state PFML that may be available to you, or exactly the same. And some employers may offer supplemental coverage to bridge the gap between state benefits and full salary replacement. So make sure you understand all of your PFML options before making any decisions.Finding Money in Life Insurance PoliciesA lot of people assume that a life insurance benefit can only be claimed after the policy holder passes away. But sometimes there are ways to access part of that benefit early. If the person you care for owns a life insurance policy, they may be able to find some money there to help cover their care costs.Accelerated Death BenefitSome life insurance policies offer an accelerated death benefit if the policy holder has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. If this describes your loved ones circumstance, they may be able to access a portion of their death benefit while theyre still alive. And they can use the proceeds any way they please, including to pay for prescriptions, healthcare, utilities, groceries, a professional caregiver, or a family caregiver (like you).One thing to keep in mind is that any money that your loved one receives through the accelerated death benefit will no longer be available in the final death benefit. For example, if their policys original death benefit was $100,000, and they claim $50,000 as an accelerated death benefit, their beneficiaries will split the remaining $50,000 upon your loved ones passing.Selling a Life Insurance PolicyNot all insurance policies offer the accelerated death benefit. But the family member you care for may be able to sell their policy via a viatical settlement or life settlement. Ill explain both of these in a moment. But in return for selling their policy, they would receive a portion of the value of the death benefit and forfeit the rest entirely. This puts money in their pockets immediately and turns their policy into an investment vehicle for the buyer.A viatical settlement could be an option if your family member has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and has a short life expectancy.Viatical settlements tend to provide a larger payout than life settlements, because the buyer would receive the death benefit sooner, and therefore have to make fewer premium payments on the policy after they buy it. So their return on their investment would be higher. If your family member is fairly healthy and has a longer life expectancy, they could choose to sell their policy through a life settlement.Again, the person you care for can use the proceeds from the sale any way they see fit, including covering their care costs while theyre still alive.The drawback to viatical settlements and life settlements is that your loved ones beneficiaries wont receive any of the death benefit after your loved one passes. Its also wise to talk with an accountant before proceeding down this path, so you can understand any tax implications.Financial Assistance Through MedicareIf you care for an aging family member, youre probably familiar with Medicarethe government sponsored health insurance for adults who are over 65 or have certain health conditions. What you may not know is that the person you care for may be able to access some Medicare benefits that can help cover caregiving costs.First, you need to know what kind of Medicare coverage your family member has: Original Medicare (Parts A and B) or a Medicare Advantage plan (Part C). A look at their Medicare card will give you your answer.If the card just says Medicare Health Insurance, they have Original Medicare.Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are offered by private insurance companies, like United Healthcare, Humana, Aetna, Cigna, etc. If your family members Medicare card also has the name of a private insurance company on it, they have a Medicare Advantage plan.Now that you know that, lets first look at the benefit available for family caregivers of someone enrolled in Original Medicare. Then well look at some valuable Medicare Advantage benefits.Medicare GUIDE Program Respite Care BenefitThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) launched a new care model this year for adults covered by Original Medicare who have dementia. Its called Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience or simply the GUIDE model. One of the benefits offered by GUIDE is up to $2,500 per year for respite services for qualified beneficiaries. Heres how you may access it:Ask your family members primary care provider or the provider organization (eg: physician group practice or health system) if they participate as a GUIDE provider. Or, contact their Medicare plan directly (the phone number is on their Medicare card) to ask if any of the plans contracted providers in your area participate as GUIDE providers.Tell your family members GUIDE care provider that youd like to take advantage of the GUIDE Respite Care Benefit. The provider will then authorize and help arrange the approved respite care services based on your family members care plan.Medicare Advantage Supplemental BenefitsInsurance companies can contract with Medicare to offer Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. And they receive financial incentives to deliver high-quality care and proactively manage their members health to avoid unnecessary care services.One of the ways they promote better health is by providing supplemental benefits. These are benefits that go above and beyond Original Medicare part A and B benefits. They may include dental, vision, and mental health coverage. So thats some big savings right there. But wait, theres more.Depending on the MA plan, supplemental benefits could include:An over-the-counter benefit that includes a debit card loaded with up to $215/month that you can spend on healthy food, over-the-counter meds, personal care products, transportation, utilities, pet supplies, and rent/mortgage assistanceA $150 annual allowance to purchase certain approved home safety devicesA personal emergency response system, at no cost to youEach MA plans supplemental benefit offering is unique. And it can be hard for families to wade through thick brochures and confusing explanations to figure out whats available. As a result, they leave a lot of these benefitsand this moneyon the table.RubyWellis currently developing a tool that will make it easy for family caregivers to view and understand their loved ones MA supplemental benefits. Until that launches, its worth it to take the time to learn about every supplemental benefit your family members plan offers.Financial Assistance through Caregiver GrantsMy favorite thing about grants is that they provide free money. It comes from an outside source and you never have to pay it back. There are caregiver grants out there that aim to alleviate the financial burden and stress associated with caring for an aging family member. They typically range in value from a few hundred to thousands of dollars.Each grant has its own eligibility criteria. For example, the person you care for must require a certain level of care or experience a certain level of impairment. Your loved ones access to other support services or long-term care programs may be a deciding factor. Or there may be income limits for the family caregiver.Often the scope of the grant will dictate what the money can be used for. Some grants cover the cost of respite care. Some pay for certain home modifications, medical equipment, or other specific health expenses.Where to Look for Caregiver GrantsAnother great thing about caregiver grants is that theyre offered by government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private foundations. So there can be quite a few of them out there. But that also means there are a lot of places to look for the grant that suits your needs.A great place to start is the Eldercare Locator, which is a fantastic tool developed and maintained by the Administration for Community Living (ACL).Heres how you use it:Go to theEldercare Locator.Enter your zip code to find a list of resources available in your area.Contact everyone on that list to ask if they provide caregiving grants or can direct you to a local organization that does.Your local Area Agency on Aging will likely be at the top of that list. In addition to possibly having grant information, they may even be able to help you prepare your grant application(s). If so, take them up on it. Preparing a grant can be a complicated and tedious process.If your family member has a chronic condition that requires in-home care, consider joining a support group for families dealing with that condition to ask about any grant information they may be able to share. Or reach out to an organization supporting people with that condition to ask if they can recommend any disease-specific grants.The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers aTemporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grantfor retired service members with service-connected disabilities, who live in their family caregivers home. This grant of up to $47,130 can be used to pay for home modifications including ramps and grab bars, widening doorways, and installing accessible bathroom fixtures.Hilarity for Charity, has a grant program that provides 3-6 months of free, professional, in-home care for people caring for aging family members with Alzheimers disease or other dementias.You can also reach out to your family members doctors office to ask if someone there can refer you to grants that could help support your loved ones care.Additional Support for Family CaregiversThere are manyresources & servicesthat provide support to family caregivers. And a number ofgovernment benefitsthat some aging adults can take advantage of to lower their monthly expenses. But often family caregivers dont have the time to track downthe support they need.If this is true for you, consider enlisting the help of a friend or family member whos unable or unwilling to do the day-to-day work of caregiving but wants to help in some way. The gift of their time can be as valuable as any wad of found money youre lucky enough to come across.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2025, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

For BIPOC caregivers, the caregiving journey can come with unique challenges, influenced by cultural expectations, systemic inequalities, and barriers to accessing healthcare. This month, we not only celebrate the resilience and dedication of caregivers but also shine a light on theresourcesandsupport systemsavailable to help BIPOC families.In this article, well explore the specific mental health challenges faced by BIPOC caregivers and introduce essential tools and BIPOC caregiver resources that can empower you. We will also introduce our free online tool designed to provide comprehensive support for BIPOC caregivers managing their loved ones mental health.Unique Challenges Faced by BIPOC CaregiversFamily caregiving, while rewarding, often brings emotional, physical, and mental strain. ForBIPOC caregivers, these challenges can be magnified due to systemic racism, economic disparities, and cultural expectations that can make it difficult to access the necessary support. Below are some of the significant challenges faced by BIPOC caregivers:1. Cultural Expectations and Family DynamicsIn many BIPOC communities, caregiving is seen as a duty or responsibility that must be fulfilled without complaint. Often, there is an expectation that the family, particularly women, will take on caregiving roles. While this sense of responsibility can foster close-knit family relationships, it can also lead to burnout when caregivers feel pressure to shoulder the burden alone.2. Access to Mental Health ServicesAccess to mental health services remains a significant barrier for BIPOC caregivers. Many are hesitant to seek out mental health care due to cultural stigma surrounding therapy and mental health treatment. Additionally, even when services are available, there is often a lack ofculturally competent care, which can lead to ineffective or misunderstood treatment. A 2018 study by theAmerican Psychological Associationfound that less than 15% of psychologists are from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds, making it harder for BIPOC caregivers to find professionals who understand their cultural experiences.3. Financial StrainBIPOC families are more likely to face financial hardships, with many caregivers balancing multiple jobs or responsibilities to provide care for their loved ones. The financial strain can intensify when caregivers need to take time off work or pay for additional care services, further contributing to the stress and anxiety experienced during their caregiving journey.Introducing Our Free Online Tool for BIPOC CaregiversRecognizing these challenges, we have developedafree online tooltailored specifically for BIPOC caregivers. This tool provides access to valuable resources, expert insights, and a supportive community to help caregivers navigate the mental health needs of their loved ones.Key Features of the Online Tool:20 Detailed Lessons:Our tool includes 20 comprehensive lessons that cover topics such as managing caregiver stress, recognizing mental health conditions in loved ones, and understanding how to balance caregiving with personal needs.

Many of us prefer not to confront the reality of aging, associated medical needs, or the prospect of requiring daily care. There is a common belief that such needs are distant or unlikely, fostering denial and procrastination in planning. While 7 in 10 people turning 65 will need some form of long-term care, a study by theCenter for a Secure Retirementfound that fewer than 1 in 3 have planned for their LTC needs and costs with their families. This gap in awareness and planning leaves families vulnerable to emotional and financial stress when faced with sudden, significant care needs.Lack of Integrated Solutions in Long-Term CareCurrently, planning for LTC costs is fragmented across multiple resources, each specializing in areas like LTC insurance, Medicaid planning, or personal savings. This siloed approach creates gaps in comprehensive planning and risk management. Many financial advisors focus on investment strategies or general retirement savings without fully addressing the potential costs and care needs associated with aging. For example, while LTC insurance is a crucial tool, it is only one piece of the puzzle. It must be considered alongside factors such as home equity, Social Security, Medicaid eligibility, and potential out-of-pocket expenses.Without a holistic approach to planning, families miss opportunities for more strategic integration of these resources, resulting in unpreparedness when care needs arise.Consequences of Fragmented PlanningIncreased Financial Risk: Without a unified plan, families might not have enough coverage or savings, leading to out-of-pocket expenses that deplete retirement funds.Missed Opportunities: Potential tax advantages, government benefits, or cost-sharing opportunities might be overlooked.Emotional and Relational Strain: Disjointed planning can lead to confusion and conflict among family members, especially when sudden decisions must be made without a clear, unified plan.Escalating Costs of Long-Term CareThe cost of LTC is a significant and growing challenge for families and the healthcare system. With an aging population and increased life expectancy, the demand for LTC services is expected to rise sharply. The costs associated with various types of care settings are also projected to increase, further straining both individual and public resources.Home Care: According toGenworths Cost of Care Survey, the national median cost of a home health aide is around $4,500 per month, expected to grow by 3-4% annually.Assisted Living Facilities: The median monthly cost for an assisted living facility is approximately $4,300, but it varies widely depending on location and care level.Nursing Homes: Nursing home costs are substantially higher, averaging about $8,000 to $10,000 per month for a semi-private room, with private rooms costing even more. These figures are projected to escalate, reaching $15,000 to $20,000 per month in some areas within the next two decades.Impact on Family Finances and Future GenerationsThe financial burden of LTC affects not only the immediate generation needing care but also future generations. When we face high out-of-pocket LTC costs, we often dip into retirement savings, liquidate assets, or rely on family members for support.Depletion of Retirement Savings: Many retirees allocate most of their savings towards daily living expenses and are unprepared for the high costs of care, affecting their financial security and ability to transfer wealth to the next generation.Increased Financial Responsibilities for Adult Children: Adult children often contribute financially or provide direct care for aging parents, which can lead to missed career opportunities, reduced work hours, or even leaving the workforce altogether, particularly for women.Impact on Generational Wealth Transfer: With retirement savings redirected toward care costs, less wealth is passed down to future generations, affecting their financial stability and ability to plan for their own aging needs.Stay tuned for Part 3, where well dive intoWaterlilyand CANs approach to addressing these financial and emotional challenges through comprehensive long-term care planning.Next Steps:Be sure to read Part 1 of this series:Navigating Long-Term Care Costsand Part 3:Navigating Long-Term Care CostsSecure Your Spot:Novembers special access to Waterlilys innovative care planning tool saw strong community interest.

As we age, the likelihood of needing some form of long-term care increases significantly. However, financial preparation for this stage of life is often lacking. According toLongTermCare.gov, nearly 70% of people turning 65 today will need some type of long-term care in their remaining years, yet only a fraction have adequately planned for these expenses.Genworths Cost of Care Surveyhighlights the reality: the median annual cost for a private room in a nursing home in 2023 was over $100,000, and these costs are only projected to rise. This disconnect between awareness and preparation represents a looming crisis for many families.The Urgency of Addressing Long-Term Care CostsWith the Baby Boomer generation entering retirement in large numbers and the average lifespan increasing, the demographic landscape is shifting dramatically. Economic pressures, such as rising healthcare costs and inflation, further complicate the situation, placing an enormous strain on both individual households and public resources. State and federal governments are beginning to recognize the unsustainable burden of LTC costs on Medicaid and other public resources. For example, Washington State has implemented theWA Cares Fund, a public long-term care insurance program, and other states, including California and Minnesota, are exploring similar initiatives. These measures, while arguably necessary, are not enough. A comprehensive and proactive approach to long-term care is essential to reduce strain on public resources and prevent financial crises for countless families.CAN and Waterlily: Expanding Support for FamiliesCaregiver Action Network(CAN) andWaterlilydeeply understand the challenges families face when navigating the complexities of long-term care planning. Together, were committed to ensuring families can provide the best possible support for their loved ones without sacrificing their financial security.As the CEO ofCaregiver Action Network, my journey with long-term care planning has been both personal and professional. When my mother faced health challenges, I realized how easy it is to underestimate the care required and the associated expenses, even for someone with experience in aging services. My family had discussed long-term care loosely, but without a formal plan, we were fortunate to find the right support. This experience solidified my commitment to working withCANto ensure that caregivers, like myself, have access to the information and resources they need to make informed financial decisions for their loved ones. It also fuels our partnership withWaterlily, providing caregivers with a holistic, accessible approach to long-term care planning so that no family has to navigate these challenges unprepared.As the CEO ofWaterlily,long-term care planning is also deeply personal for me. At 16, I faced caregiving when my aunt, who helped raise me, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. My family was unprepared for the emotional and financial devastation that followed. Watching my aunt suffer while navigating the complexities of her care and financial responsibilities prompted me to shift my career from aerospace engineering to healthcare. This personal tragedy became the foundation of my lifes work and ultimately led to the creation ofWaterlily.AtWaterlily, we use AI to predict long-term care needs and provide families with clear, actionable steps to prepare for the future. By partnering withCAN, we aim to bridge the gap between awareness and preparation, empowering caregivers with the tools, resources, and confidence they need to navigate the complexities of aging.Read Part 2 of this series, where we will explore thecurrent reality of aging and long-term care planningin more depth.Next Steps:Be sure to read Part 2 of this series:The Realities of Aging and Gaps in Long-Term Care Planningand Part 3:Navigating Long-Term Care CostsSecure Your Spot:Novembers special access to Waterlilys innovative care planning tool saw strong community interest.

Over time, as caregiving responsibilities increase and personal well-being takes a back seat, caregivers can develop this condition, which mirrors symptoms of chronic stress and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Unlike typical stress, caregiver stress syndrome is a result of long-term caregiving without adequate support, often leaving caregivers feeling overwhelmed and isolated.Recognizing the Symptoms of Caregiver Stress SyndromeIf youre a caregiver, its crucial to recognize the warning signs of stress that may be developing into something more serious. Some common symptoms include:Emotional Symptoms:Depression, anxiety, or frequent feelings of helplessnessIncreased irritability and frustration with caregiving tasksEmotional outbursts, even over small issuesResentment toward the care recipientPhysical Symptoms:Chronic fatigue or a constant feeling of being drainedDifficulty sleeping or insomniaFrequent headaches, muscle aches, or body painsWeakened immune system, leading to frequent illnessesBehavioral Symptoms:Social withdrawal from friends, family, and activitiesNeglecting personal health (e.g., missing medical appointments)Turning to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as alcohol or overeatingCauses of Caregiver Stress SyndromeThere are several factors that contribute to caregiver stress syndrome, which may vary depending on the nature of caregiving responsibilities. Some common causes include:Role Overload:Caregivers often feel like they are responsible for everything, without asking for help.Emotional Toll:Watching a loved one struggle with a chronic or terminal condition can lead to prolonged emotional exhaustion.Grief and Guilt:Guilt often arises from the feeling that caregivers should be doing more, even when theyre already doing their best.Lack of Support:Caregivers can feel isolated, with little help or understanding from others.To learn more about caregiver stress, visit theAmerican Psychological Associationfor additional insights.How to Manage and Cope with Caregiver Stress SyndromeTaking steps to manage stress and seek support is critical in preventing caregiver burnout. Here are some strategies:Prioritize Self-Care:Make time for yourself. This includes regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, and ensuring adequate rest. By focusing on your well-being, you can prevent the emotional and physical exhaustion associated with long-term caregiving. Learn more about self-care strategies atMental Health America. And, check out CANsSelf-Care Checklist for caregivers.Take Breaks and Use Respite Care:You cannot do it all alone. Its important to seek help from family members, friends, or professional respite care services. TheNational Respite Locatorcan help you find temporary care options, giving you the time you need to recharge.Join Support Groups:Connecting with others who are experiencing the same challenges can be comforting. You can share stories, gain advice, and build a support system. Consider joining online communities like theCaregiver Action Networkor in-person groups in your local area.Seek Professional Guidance:If stress is leading to severe emotional or psychological problems, seek help from a mental health professional. Therapy or counseling can be an excellent outlet to discuss frustrations, emotions, and coping strategies.Use Available Resources:There are many resources available to help caregivers manage their stress and find support. TheCaregiver Help Deskis one such resource where caregivers can speak with experts and get personalized advice on their unique situations.When to Seek Medical HelpCaregiver stress syndrome, if left untreated, can result in more severe health problems such as hypertension, heart disease, and depression. If youre noticing that your stress levels are affecting your health or emotional well-being, its crucial to consult with a healthcare provider. Additionally, caregivers should be mindful of their own health needs and not delay seeking medical attention for their symptoms.Long-Term Solutions for Caregiver StressDevelop a Care Plan:Organize caregiving duties and divide tasks among family members. This helps ensure that caregiving responsibilities are shared.Set Boundaries:Learn to say no when necessary and establish limits on what you can realistically manage. Delegate responsibilities whenever possible.Practice Mindfulness:Engage in relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises to reduce stress.For more in-depth information, visit theNational Institute on Agingto explore more about caregiving health and stress management.Additional ResourcesAARPs Caregiver Resource Centeroffers financial, legal, and health advice for caregivers.Alzheimers Associationoffers specialized resources for caregivers supporting loved ones with dementia.Family Caregiver Allianceprovides a wide range of services and support for caregivers facing the challenges of caregiving.Preventing Caregiver Stress SyndromeIt is important to remember that you dont have to handle everything alone.

For children, anxiety may show up as persistent worry, fear, or nervousness, often causing disruptions in school, social interactions, and at home.According to theAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, anxiety disorders in children may include:Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):Excessive worry about various aspects of life, such as school performance, friendships, or family situations.Separation Anxiety Disorder:Extreme fear or worry about being away from parents or caregivers.Social Anxiety Disorder:Intense fear of social interactions or being judged by others.Specific Phobias:Irrational fears of certain objects or situations, such as heights or animals.Anxiety in children can lead to physical symptoms like headaches, stomachaches, or difficulty sleeping. In some cases, children may become irritable, withdrawn, or avoid activities they previously enjoyed.Anxiety in BIPOC Children: Unique ChallengesWhile anxiety is common across all racial and ethnic groups, children from BIPOC communities may experience additional stressors related to their cultural identity and experiences with racism or discrimination. These stressors can exacerbate anxiety and may not always be recognized by caregivers or healthcare providers.1. Racial Trauma and DiscriminationChildren from BIPOC communities are often exposed to racial trauma, which can include experiences of racism, microaggressions, and discrimination. Racial trauma can cause chronic stress, which may manifest as anxiety. For example, a child who faces bullying due to their race or ethnicity may develop social anxiety or fear of going to school.In addition, children from BIPOC families may internalize societal stereotypes or face pressure to conform to cultural expectations, further contributing to their anxiety. Caregivers need to be mindful of how these external stressors impact their childs mental health.2. Cultural Stigma Around Mental HealthIn many BIPOC communities, mental health issues are stigmatized, leading families to dismiss anxiety as simply nerves or a phase that the child will outgrow. This cultural stigma can prevent caregivers from seeking the help their child needs, causing the anxiety to worsen over time.It is essential to break down these barriers and recognize that anxiety in children is a serious issue that deserves attention and care. Providing culturally relevant mental health resources can help reduce the stigma and encourage families to seek appropriate support.3. Lack of Culturally Competent CareChildren in BIPOC communities are often less likely to receive adequate mental health care due to systemic barriers, such as lack of access to culturally competent providers. These providers are trained to understand the unique cultural and societal factors influencing a childs mental health. Unfortunately, BIPOC families may face challenges in finding professionals who can connect with their child on this level, leading to misdiagnosis or ineffective treatment.Recognizing Signs of Anxiety in ChildrenRecognizing anxiety in children can be difficult, especially when symptoms are mistaken for behavioral issues. Some common signs of anxiety in children include:Frequent headaches or stomachaches without a medical explanation.Irritability, restlessness, or difficulty concentrating.Avoiding activities they used to enjoy.Excessive worry about future events or past mistakes.Difficulty sleeping or frequent nightmares.Clinginess or refusal to leave caregivers.Its important to approach your child with empathy and understanding, allowing them to express their fears and worries in a supportive environment.How BIPOC Caregivers Can Help Children Manage AnxietyWhile it can be challenging to address anxiety in children, there are several steps caregivers can take to help their child manage their symptoms and feel supported.1. Open Conversations About AnxietyEncourage your child to talk openly about their feelings and worries. Create a safe space where they feel comfortable expressing their emotions without judgment. Normalize conversations around anxiety and mental health, reassuring your child that its okay to feel anxious and that help is available.2. Teach Coping StrategiesHelp your child develop coping mechanisms to manage their anxiety. Techniques like deep breathing, mindfulness, and journaling can help children relax and regulate their emotions. Engage in activities that promote calmness, such as yoga or art therapy, to provide an outlet for stress.3. Seek Professional HelpIf your childs anxiety is impacting their daily life, seeking professional help is crucial. Look for a therapist or counselor who specializes in working with children and understands the cultural context of your family. Finding a culturally competent therapist can make a significant difference in your childs mental health journey.4.

According to the Pew Research Center, almost half of adults aged 40 to 59 find themselves part of this growing group, balancing caregiving roles for two generations.Interestingly, while men and women both fall into this category, women bear a more significant share of the responsibilities. According to Pew Research, 60% of sandwich generation caregivers are women, and on average, they spend 45 minutes more each day on caregiving tasks than men.In Hispanic communities, nearly 31% of individuals with children also have at least one parent over 65, creating an even more challenging scenario of balancing cultural expectations, financial obligations, and practical care.The Types of Care Provided by the Sandwich GenerationSandwich generation caregivers provide various types of support to both their children and aging parents, including:Financial Assistance:Many caregivers manage their parents finances or help them with medical expenses.Emotional Support:Caregivers often provide emotional stability and reassurance to both children and aging parents.Daily Living Support:Some help aging parents with activities of daily living (ADLs), including meal preparation, medication management, and transportation.The aging population is growing, meaning more caregivers are likely to find themselves providing such assistance as their parents age.Challenges Faced by Sandwich Generation CaregiversCaring for two generations simultaneously can be overwhelming. A Pew Research study reported that 31% of sandwich generation caregivers feel constantly pressed for time. Balancing caregiving with a career is particularly challenging, as caregivers spend around 30 hours a week on caregiving duties, often at the expense of their professional responsibilities.Financial stress is another challenge. On average, sandwich generation caregivers spend about $10,000 per year on caregiving expenses, which can affect long-term financial stability, including retirement savings. AARP found that 15% of caregivers support both their children and their aging parents financially, with 30% of caregivers struggling to meet their expenses.Tips for Managing Sandwich Caregiving ResponsibilitiesHere are some practical steps to help ease the burden of sandwich caregiving:Delegate Tasks:Dont try to do everything on your own. Ask siblings or extended family to help with caregiving duties or take advantage of community resources for seniors, likeBenefitsCheckUp, which helps caregivers find available support.Communicate with Your Employer:Many caregivers are eligible for job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Talk to your employer about flexible working arrangements that can help you balance caregiving and professional responsibilities.Stay Organized:Keeping track of both your childrens and your parents needs can be overwhelming. Utilize caregiving apps or tools likeLotsa Helping Handsto coordinate tasks and stay on top of doctors appointments and medication schedules.Prioritize Self-Care:Caregivers often sacrifice their well-being for others. Its essential to schedule time for self-care activities such as exercise, reading, or catching up with friends to avoid burnout. TheFamily Caregiver Allianceoffers a range of resources to help caregivers find balance.Managing the Financial Impact of Sandwich CaregivingFinances are a significant stressor for sandwich generation caregivers, especially when balancing the costs of raising children and caring for aging parents. Creating a budget that takes both immediate caregiving expenses and long-term savings into account is crucial. You may also want to explore financial resources likeAARPs guide on Sandwich Generation Caregivingto find support for managing costs.Navigating Emotional SupportEmotional burnout is a common concern for caregivers in the sandwich generation. The demands of caregiving for both children and parents can lead to feelings of isolation, guilt, and stress. Connecting with others who are in similar situations through support groups or online communities, like theCaregiver Action Networks Facebook group, can help alleviate emotional strain.Caring for Both GenerationsWhile the challenges of sandwich caregiving can seem insurmountable, its essential to seek help when needed. Whether its financial assistance, emotional support, or simply asking for help from friends and family, you dont have to navigate caregiving alone. With the right resources, you can successfully care for both generations without sacrificing your own well-being.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

The challenges faced by BIPOC individuals in seeking and receiving adequate mental health care are influenced by systemic inequalities, cultural stigmas, and socioeconomic barriers. Addressing these challenges is essential for both individual well-being and the health of entire communities.In this article, we will explore the mental health challenges encountered by BIPOC communities and introduce a new, free online tool designed specifically to support BIPOC caregivers of children with mental health issues. This tool aims to provide the necessary resources and community support to navigate these challenges effectively.Mental Health Challenges in BIPOC CommunitiesSystemic Inequality and Access to CareOne of the most significant barriers to mental health care for BIPOC communities issystemic inequality. According to theAmerican Psychiatric Association, BIPOC individuals are less likely to receive mental health care compared to their white counterparts. When they do receive care, it is often of lower quality due to a lack of culturally competent providers who understand the unique cultural and societal factors affecting BIPOC mental health.Socioeconomic factors further complicate access to care. Many BIPOC individuals live in areas with limited access to mental health services. The high cost of care, lack of insurance, and prioritizing basic necessities over health care contribute to disparities in mental health outcomes.Cultural Stigma and Mistrust of the Healthcare SystemThe cultural stigma surrounding mental health is prevalent in many BIPOC communities. Mental health issues are often viewed as a sign of weakness or personal failure, leading individuals to avoid seeking help. This stigma is compounded by a historical mistrust of the healthcare system, rooted in past abuses and ongoing discrimination.For instance, theTuskegee Syphilis Studyhas had a lasting impact on the Black communitys trust in the healthcare system. Such historical events contribute to a deep-seated reluctance to engage with mental health services, even when they are desperately needed.Racism and DiscriminationRacism and discrimination are pervasive stressors contributing to mental health issues within BIPOC communities. The chronic stress of facing racial prejudice and discrimination can lead to conditions such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. This phenomenon, known asracial trauma, is a significant yet under-recognized factor in the mental health struggles of BIPOC individuals.Additionally, microaggressionssubtle, often unintentional expressions of prejudicecan accumulate over time, exacerbating feelings of isolation, stress, and worthlessness. Addressing the mental health impact of racism is crucial for effective intervention.Lack of Culturally Competent CareEven when BIPOC individuals seek mental health care, they often encounter providers who lack thecultural competenceto address their specific needs. Culturally competent care involves understanding the cultural contexts influencing a patients mental health and integrating this understanding into treatment.Unfortunately, the lack of diversity among mental health professionals means many BIPOC individuals do not receive care sensitive to their cultural backgrounds, leading to misdiagnosis, ineffective treatment, and dissatisfaction with the mental health care system.Introducing Our Free Online Tool for BIPOC CaregiversRecognizing these challenges, we have developed a free online tool specifically designed to support BIPOC caregivers of children with mental health issues.

As September is Blood Cancer Awareness Month, it is a poignant reminder of the many individuals battling various forms of cancer and the caregivers who support them. With approximately 2.8 million cancer caregivers in the United States, understanding the role of a cancer caregiver is crucial for both those new to caregiving and those seeking to enhance their approach.What is a Cancer Caregiver?Cancer caregivers play a pivotal role in the care and support of individuals diagnosed with cancer. As a caregiver, you become an essential member of your loved ones healthcare team, assisting with both physical and emotional needs. Your responsibilities may include:Coordinating Care:This involves managing medication schedules, arranging doctors appointments, scheduling tests, and handling insurance matters.Daily Assistance:Depending on the severity of the illness, you might help with feeding, dressing, bathing, and mobility.Communication:You will often need to update the healthcare team about changes in your loved ones condition and manage treatment side effects.Your involvement is crucial for the practical aspects of care and for providing emotional support and encouragement throughout the treatment process.What Does a Cancer Caregiver Do?The role of a cancer caregiver evolves as your loved ones needs change throughout their treatment. With many treatments now administered in outpatient settings, caregivers often perform tasks traditionally handled by medical professionals. Key responsibilities include:Managing Medical Care:Keeping track of your loved ones health and coordinating with healthcare providers to adjust treatment as needed.Advocating for Your Loved One:Acting as their advocate in medical settings and making informed decisions about treatment options.Providing Emotional Support:Offering encouragement and emotional stability, particularly during challenging treatments.Depending on the course of the illness and treatment, you may also be involved in making end-of-life decisions.The Dynamics of Family CaregivingCaregiving for a family member often stems from a place of love, but a sense of obligation can also drive it. The dynamics of family caregiving can be complex:Family Dynamics:The caregiver role is often taken on by the family member who is most available. This can lead to resentment or imbalance, especially if other family members are not contributing equally.Past Relationships:Caregiving can be particularly challenging if there are unresolved issues or strained relationships with the person needing care. Its important to manage personal feelings and focus on providing compassionate care.Managing Expectations:Caregiving may not resolve all past conflicts, but it can offer a sense of fulfillment and peace of mind, knowing you are doing everything possible to support your loved one.Common Cancer Caregiving ChallengesBeing a caregiver for someone with cancer can present several challenges:Performing Medical Tasks:You may be required to change dressings or manage medication regimens, which can be daunting without proper training.Physical and Emotional Distress:Studies have shown that caregivers for cancer patients report high levels of physical and psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and burnout.Health Issues:The stress of caregiving can lead to physical problems like headaches, digestive issues, and increased susceptibility to illness.Caregivers may also struggle to communicate with their loved ones. The most effective approach is to listen and offer specific forms of help rather than vague support.Cancer Caregiving ResourcesFor those navigating the complexities of cancer caregiving, various resources can offer support and guidance:American Cancer Society: Cancer A-Z Comprehensive information on cancer types, treatments, and caregiving.National Cancer Institute: Support for Caregivers of Cancer Patients Resources and advice for caregivers.CancerCare Offers counseling, support groups, and financial assistance.CDC: Advice for Caregivers of Cancer SurvivorsGuidelines for maintaining ones own health while caring for a cancer survivor.Help for Cancer Caregivers Create a self-care guide to help manage your stress.Livestrong: Comprehensive Guide for Caregivers Tips and support for managing caregiving responsibilities.Cancer.Net: Tips for Being a Successful Caregiver Strategies for effective caregiving.Cancer caregiving is challenging but deeply rewarding.

Dementia caregiver stress often surpasses that of other types of caregiving due to the demanding nature of the disease. According to theAlzheimers Association, caregivers of individuals with dementia face double the emotional, financial, and physical stress compared to those caring for individuals without dementia. They are also at a heightened risk for depression and chronic health issues.Statistics reveal that approximately 40% of dementia caregivers experience depression, a stark contrast to the 5-17% of non-caregivers in the same age group. Additionally, dementia caregivers may suffer from compromised immune systems for up to three years post-caregiving, increasing their likelihood of chronic illnesses. TheCenter for Mental Health and Aginghighlights that 60% of dementia caregivers juggle work and caregiving, leading to nearly double the average out-of-pocket expenses compared to other caregivers.Recognizing Signs of Dementia Caregiver StressIdentifying the signs of stress is crucial for managing it effectively. Here are common symptoms of dementia caregiver stress:Social Withdrawal:Avoiding social interactions and losing interest in activities you once enjoyed.Feelings of Depression:Persistent sadness and a sense of hopelessness.Anxiety About the Future:Worries about your loved ones condition and uncertainty about the future.Feelings of Helplessness:Doubts about your caregiving abilities and handling increasing care needs.Denial:Struggling to accept your loved ones diagnosis and its impact.Irritability and Frustration:Unusual impatience or anger towards your loved one.Caregiver Sleep Disturbances:Changes in sleep patterns, including insomnia or excessive sleep.Caregiver Fatigue:Persistent exhaustion or lack of energy.Concentration Issues:Difficulty focusing or making decisions.Emotional Outbursts:Sudden bursts of anger or other strong emotions.Neglecting Self-Care:Ignoring your own health needs and becoming ill more frequently.Physical Symptoms:Experiencing headaches, stomachaches, or muscle tension.Effective Strategies to Manage Dementia Caregiver StressTo manage dementia caregiver stress, consider the following strategies:Reach Out for SupportContact CANs Free Caregiver Help Desk:Caregiver Action Networkoffers a free Help Desk with experts ready to provide support, answer questions, and offer a listening ear. They are available Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 7 PM ET.Join a Support Group:Connecting with others in similar situations can provide emotional relief and practical advice. Support groups allow you to share experiences and learn from fellow caregivers.Seek Emotional and Practical SupportTalk to Trusted Individuals:Discuss your feelings with friends, family members, counselors, or clergy. Having a support network can help manage emotional burdens.Accept Help:When others offer assistance, take them up on it. Delegating tasks or errands can significantly reduce your workload and stress.Utilize Community Resources:Look into local programs that offer respite care, household help, or additional caregiving support. These resources can provide temporary relief and practical assistance.Explore CANs Resources:CANs Facebook Groupand theCaregiver Help Deskprovide additional support and information tailored to your needs.Prioritize Your HealthFocus on Mental Health:Depression and anxiety are common among caregivers. Seek help from a mental health professional experienced in treating depression, such as a therapist or psychiatrist.Keep Up with Doctor Visits:Regular checkups are vital for maintaining your health. Ensure you attend your own doctors appointments.Find Time for Yourself:Schedule small moments for personal enjoyment, like having coffee, reading a book, or walking.

This behavior is called sundowning. Although the exact cause is unknown, it may be due to overstimulation during the day, insufficient exposure to sunlight, tiredness or hunger, or a disturbance to your loved ones biological clock, confusing day and night.Daily Care Tips for BIPOC Dementia CaregiversAs dementia progresses, BIPOC caregivers often face additional challenges related to cultural roles, family dynamics, and access to culturally competent healthcare services. Establishing daily routines, using culturally relevant communication techniques, and incorporating traditional healing practices can enhance care quality and patient comfort.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Alzheimers.gov website has some great everyday dementia caregiver tips:Try to keep a routine, such as bathing, dressing, and eating at the same time each day.Help your loved one write down to-do lists, appointments, and events in a notebook or calendar.Plan activities that your loved one enjoys and try to do them at the same time each day.Consider a system or reminders for helping those who must take medications regularly.When dressing or bathing, allow the person to do as much as possible.Buy loose-fitting, comfortable, easy-to-use clothing, such as clothes with elastic waistbands, fabric fasteners, or large zipper pulls instead of shoelaces, buttons, or buckles.Be gentle and respectful. Tell the person what you are going to do, step by step, while you help them bathe or get dressed.Respect your loved ones privacy. Close the door or cover them with a robe when helping them bathe or get dressed.Serve meals in a consistent, familiar place and give the person enough time to eat.Managing Behavioral Changes in BIPOC CommunitiesEffective management of behavioral changes involves creating a supportive environment that respects BIPOC cultural norms and beliefs. Strategies like maintaining familiar surroundings, involving family and community elders in care decisions, and acknowledging spiritual or religious practices can help reduce agitation and promote emotional well-being.Home Safety Considerations for BIPOC Dementia PatientsEffective management of behavioral changes involves creating a supportive environment that respects BIPOC cultural norms and beliefs.Strategies like maintaining familiar surroundings, involving family and community elders in care decisions, and acknowledging spiritual or religious practices can help reduce agitation and promote emotional well-being.To reduce agitation:Create a soothing environment and remove any objects that tend to trigger the behavior.Maintain a routine and keep objects and furniture around the house in the same place.Validate your loved ones feelings. Any emotion they are feeling is very real to them.Reassure your loved one that you are there to protect them.Distraction is your best strategy.To address paranoia:If your loved one thinks that something is missing, help them look for itand then distract them with another activity.Explain to other family members and anyone else in your loved ones circle that these behaviors are all part of the diseaseand are very real to your loved one.Establish some sort of nonverbal reassurance to let your loved one know that you are there and will not let anything bad happen to them.To address sundowning:Increase your loved ones activity during the day. Discourage napping.Pay attention to your loved ones sugar and caffeine intake, particularly late in the day.Plan a relaxing, but structured activity for the late afternoon and early evening hours, like a walk outside, listening to music, or playing a game.Pay close attention to the toileting, pain, and nutrition needs of your loved one. Being uncomfortable especially if your loved one cannot communicate their discomfort can trigger these behaviors.Dont try to convince your loved one that their hallucinations or delusions are not true. It wont work and is likely to make them more agitated. Instead, acknowledge and validate their feelings.Home Safety Tips for Dementia PatientsEnsuringhome safetyfor BIPOC individuals with dementia requires addressing specific cultural needs, such as dietary preferences, mobility challenges, and traditional healing practices. Installing culturally appropriate safety features like grab bars, ensuring access to culturally relevant emergency services, and providing information in multiple languages are crucial steps.Planning for Future Care NeedsPlanning ahead in BIPOC communities involves addressing unique financial, legal, and healthcare access barriers. Initiatives like community-based support groups, culturally tailored educational resources, and advocacy for equitable healthcare policies can empower BIPOC caregivers and enhance long-term care planning.Resources for BIPOC CaregiversFor BIPOC caregivers navigating dementia care, resources like CANs Lighting Your Way provide valuable insights into managing behavioral symptoms and ensuring comprehensive care.There are some steps that you should consider taking:Observe how well your loved one performsactivities of daily livingbathing, eating, and getting dressed. Can they get around on their own? Are they able to manage their finances? How is their driving? Are they able to manage their medication?While they can help you, put together afull medical history. Other than dementia, do they have any health conditions? Whatmedicationsare they taking? Have they had any past surgeries, and if so, why? Any allergies? What are the medical histories of their immediate family? Are there any diseases or major conditions?Get your loved onesfinancesin order. Ensure you have all the account numbers, account balances, insurance policies, investments, and passwords so that you can manage their finances when they are no longer able. This is a difficult conversation to have, but its important.Put together a legal plan. Ensure that your loved ones will andadvance directivesare up to date.Put all of your loved ones important documents in a safe placethings like their birth certificate, marriage certificate, deeds or titles, legal documents, bank account information, insurance policies, passport, andmedical records.By understanding and addressing the unique challenges faced by BIPOC communities in dementia care, caregivers can provide more effective support and enhance the quality of life for their loved ones.Other Resources for BIPOC Dementia Caregivers:CANs Communityis an online Facebook Group for caregivers that allows for a space free of stigma and fear.Through theCaregiver Help Desk, you can connect with a caregiving expert to find a listening ear and the support you needby phone, e-mail, or chat.Sometimes, it helps to talk to people who have been through similar situations and faced the challenges youre facing.

As the demands of specialized care consume your daily routine, you might find yourself struggling to maintain the connection and intimacy you once shared with your partner.Many caregiving parents experience this challenge, and its essential to understand that youre not alone in navigating these complex emotions and relationship changes.Why Intimacy Often Suffers in Caregiving RelationshipsThe impact of caregiving on relationships often catches couples by surprise.

By organizing family meetings, you can create a structured environment to discuss and address your loved ones needs, plan tasks, and share responsibilities. These meetings foster open communication and allow family members to collaborate effectively.Why Family Meetings MatterFamily meetings are a powerful tool for ensuring that everyone is on the same page about caregiving duties. Regularfamily caregiving discussionscreate an opportunity for each family member to voice their opinions, express concerns, and work together towards common goals. Ultimately, family meetings improvecaregiving coordinationand help avoid misunderstandings, which can reduce conflicts and enhance the care provided to your loved one.How to Organize an Effective Family MeetingOrganizing afamily meetingrequires careful planning to ensure that everyones voices are heard and key decisions are made. Here are some practical steps:Prepare a Family Meeting Agenda:Outline the main topics you want to discuss, prioritizing the most pressing issues such as financial planning, medical decisions, and caregiving schedules. Sharing the agenda ahead of time can help everyone stay focused and give them time to prepare their thoughts.Select a Neutral, Comfortable Location:Choose a space that is quiet and free from interruptions. Whether its someones home or a community center, an environment where everyone feels comfortable will help the meeting go smoothly. For families who are geographically distant, consider setting up a video or phone conference to include everyone.Choosing the Right Time and PlaceThe timing and environment of a family meeting are crucial to its success. Holding a meeting in a neutral, private space like a family members living room or a rented room can foster more open discussions. If there are young children involved, consider arranging childcare to minimize distractions. This careful selection of place and time demonstrates respect for everyones availability and allows for more focused caregiving communication.Encouraging ParticipationSuccessful family meetings rely on the active participation of each family member. Encourage each person to share their thoughts and feelings, as this promotes a sense of collaboration and empathy. You may also consider assigning someone the role of facilitator to ensure everyone stays on topic and respects each others time. If you anticipate any difficulty in managing participation, an outside mediator can be helpful to facilitate the conversation and keep discussions productive.Benefits of Collaborative Decision-MakingOne of the mainbenefits of family meetingsin caregiving is collaborative decision-making. When family members work together, decisions are more likely to reflect the needs and strengths of everyone involved. For example, some family members might be better suited to handle financial matters, while others may have a closer relationship with the care recipient and prefer assisting with personal care. This approach also allows families to leverage each members unique skills and preferences, creating a well-roundedcaregiving plan.Common Challenges and SolutionsFamily meetings in caregiving can sometimes reveal underlying tensions or unresolved conflicts. Family members may bring different ideas and expectations to the table, which can lead to disagreements. Here are a few strategies to manage these challenges:Respect Differences:Each family member may have different perspectives on caregiving responsibilities. Accepting these differences and understanding each others strengths can help avoid conflict and create a supportive caregiving environment.Use Time Limits:To prevent getting sidetracked, limit discussion time for each agenda item. If someone begins to dominate the conversation, politely remind them of the time limit and encourage others to contribute.Consider a Mediator:If conflicts arise or communication becomes challenging, inviting a mediator or a neutral party can be helpful. This person can keep the conversation on track and prevent discussions from becoming heated.Resources for CaregiversHaving the right resources can make family meetings more productive and reduce stress incaregiving coordination. Here are some helpful tools and articles:Caregiver Action Network Resources Find articles, tools, and tips for family caregivers.Communication Strategies Learn more about effective communication strategies for family caregivers.Coping With Role Overload Prioritizing help and support for effective care for your loved one.The ResultWhile its not always possible to resolve every issue in a single family meeting, establishing regularroutine caregiving meetingscan make a big difference. Review each meetings outcomes by discussing the agreed-upon items and assigning roles. At the end of each meeting, set a time and place for the next meeting and share the meeting notes with everyone involved. This approach reinforces transparency and keeps everyone updated, fostering a stronger, united approach to caregiving.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Did it make you wonder if you were going to end up in bed yourself with a bad back? Because caregiving can be such a strenuous physical activity, its important to learn what you can do to ensure that you dont hurt yourself in the process.There are simple steps you can take to increase your own strength and flexibility and to ensure your safety and the safety of your loved one. Even if lifts and transfers are not part of your daily routine, knowing how to protect your back is important.Maximize Your Physical EnvironmentPart of the key to safely assisting your loved one at home is to make sure that your home environment is accessible, comfortable, and free of safety hazards. The physical environment should support the Caregiver Lifting, not hinder it, says Judith Sexton, foundation administrator for Home Instead Senior Care. Sexton suggests that family caregivers evaluate their living space for items that might pose a potential hazard when attempting to lift their family members or transfer them from one place in the home to another. Maximizing the accessibility, safety, and comfort level of the home helps support the family caregiver as well as the care recipient, she says.Learn Proper Body MechanicsBody mechanics is the term used to describe the way we use our bodies. The goal is to move in a safe and efficient manner. If you use your body incorrectly, you can put too much stress on certain structures and these may become damaged. The wear and tear accumulates over time. There are simple rules to follow to keep your body in the best possible alignment.Principles of Proper Body MechanicsTo help ensure that you achieve proper body mechanics, it helps to have strength and flexibility.Maintain proper posture while standing, sitting or lying down. Proper posture keeps stress to a minimum.When standing, try to keep your head erect with your chin gently pulled back. Imagine a string attached to the top of your head, pulling it straight up.Wear proper shoes to help you maintain correct posture. Keep heels low to prevent tension on your lower back.When sitting, use a supportive chair and hold your head erect to prevent slumping. Use a lumbar or low-back cushion to help maintain the gentle curves of your spine. Armrests help support your body as well.You will be surprised at how much better you may begin to feel just by incorporating these simple tips into your daily life.Learn to Move and Lift Like a Physical TherapistProper body mechanics are the key to lifting your loved one correctly.Caregiver Lifting should try to improve and maintain their muscle strength and overall flexibility as much as possible to diminish the risk of injury. The following guidelines will help you:To avoid back strain and injury:Dont lean forward from your hips during standing activities such as washing dishes, dressing, or brushing your teeth. This puts pressure on your lower back and may also affect your neck and shoulders. Instead, bend your knees, NOT YOUR BACK.Dont stand in a fixed position for too long. Try to put one foot on something (e.g., a box or stool) to redistribute your weight.Dont sit for extended periods of time. Try to get up every hour to walk or stretch.Take Care of YourselfFamily caregivers in particular should try to take better care of themselves by examining their general fitness level and their lifestyle choices. It may be helpful to establish goals for yourself and to find a buddy who also wants to improve his/her fitness level.One of the easiest ways to get exercise and to control weight is through a walking program. There are also simple exercises you can do at home to improve the strength of your entire body. These include squats or lunges, sit-ups, and lifting weights. None of these exercises need to cost you money or take a lot of time. Soup cans, water bottles, and bags of rice make excellent weights. If you dont feel that you have time for any type of walking or strength-training program, how about making a commitment to stretch during every commercial that comes on the television? The key is to do something, no matter how small, to get yourself moving.Along with physical activity, remember that its just as important to get enough rest and to maintain a balanced diet, both of which can be a challenge for a family caregiver lifting . Make sure you get plenty of calcium and protein for strong bones and muscles.Know When You Need HelpKnowing when you need help is important. Asking a neighbor or a friend to help you can make the difference in keeping an injury from occurring. Sometimes, a piece of durable medical equipment, such as a transfer belt,is all that you need to help you avoid injury.If you do experience an injury while caring for your loved one, dont ignore it or make light of it. Its important to seek medical attention promptly. Most problems can be resolved, so seeking appropriate medical treatment should be a priority.The role of caregiver lifting is a physically demanding one. You can help ensure that you are there for your loved one tomorrow by taking steps today to provide assistance in the most efficient and effective manner possible.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Many caregivers carry the weight of managing daily tasks, offering emotional support, and often dealing with financial strain, but trying to handle everything alone can lead tocaregiver burnout. This page is designed to provide valuable information oncaregiver support, available resources, and practical steps to get the assistance you need to reduce stress and take care of yourself along the way.***What I learned from my own experience is that family caregivers are the ones holding everything together and theyre paying a high price, including putting their own health at risk.Sheila spoke these words when her dear friend was diagnosed with cancer, and she became a caregiver for the first time.For years, Sheila emotionally and practically supported her friend, who dealt with a rare form of cancer that started in her salivary glands and moved into her bones.Sheila was just barely managing to keep her own life together while at the same time helping her friend. And then crisis hit: Sheilas widowed mother slipped into what she describes as a, long and painful decline.Just when it didnt seem possible to continue caring for both her friend and her mother, Sheila received a life-transforming phone call from a therapist inviting her to attend a special meeting of 12 people who would become partners in caregiving.Signs You Need Help as a CaregiverCaregiving is a rewarding yet demanding role, and its crucial to identify signs that you might needhelp as a caregiver. Ignoring the signs of burnout can lead to serious physical and mental health issues, which may impact both you and those you care for. Here are some signs that may indicate you needcaregiver assistance:Physical Symptoms:Chronic fatigue, muscle pain, headaches, or lack of sleep.Emotional Strain:Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or experiencing feelings of resentment or isolation.Financial Stress:Increased financial burdens from caregiving expenses, reduced work hours, or job loss.Recognizing these signs and seekingsupport groups for caregiverscan help you manage these challenges and prevent burnout.Why Do People Refuse to Ask for or Accept Help?For many caregivers, asking for help can feel daunting. As caregiving expert and author NoraKlaver points out, much of this hesitance stems from underlying fears. We may fear damaging our relationships, she says. Losing control might be another fear. We might also worry about appearing weak or incapable of managing our own lives.Beyond fear, there are several other reasons why caregivers choose to fly solo and avoid seekingcaregiver assistance:Conflicting Demands:Caregivers often juggle equally important tasks with limited time, making it hard to coordinate extra help.Overloaded Schedules:Finding and managing support can feel like one more task in an already full schedule.Complexity of Services:Navigating the maze of services and paperwork is challenging, and by the time help becomes available, it may feel too late or insufficient.Qualifying Criteria:Many agencies offer help based on specific qualifying criteria, such as age, health condition, income, or location, which may limit access.High Cost of Services:Companion and chore services can be costly and are rarely covered by insurance, adding a financial barrier.Sporadic Support:Volunteer groups and faith-based organizations may provide assistance, but its often sporadic or short-term.Privacy Concerns:Some caregivers or their loved ones are reluctant to open their homes and lives to strangers.Lack of Confidence in Help:Some caregivers may want to seek help but dont know where to start, or they may fear becoming too reliant on external support.While these barriers are understandable, recognizing them is the first step in finding a balance between independent caregiving and accepting the assistance that could make life more manageable. Identifyingcaregiver support groupsand services suited to your needs can empower you to seek help confidently, knowing its okay to rely on others without feeling youre losing control.Community Resources for CaregiversWhen diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in her shoulder, Pam in Massachusetts both needed help and provided it to others.As the young mother of three, Pam says, I desperately needed this, and accepting it enabled us to maintain some normalcy in our lives when everything was very fragile.Through her experience, Pam met another resident who received meal preparation assistance from friends and neighbors. They spoke of the angels who helped and envisioned a network to assist families facing short-term crises. This dream led to a volunteer network with over 300 members providing meals, shopping help, yard work, childcare, and transportation.Its a feel-good thing. You see in the eyes of people helping that they feel good about what they are doing.and they want to do more, says Pam.As the volunteer network of caregiver support has grown, Pam has turned to technology to help keep everyone and everything coordinated. Current postings of needs, a scheduling calendar, message boards, status updates, email reminder notices, and even blogs are available.Thankfully, a variety ofcommunity services for caregiversare available to support you in your caregiving journey. Both national and local organizations provide vital resources, including respite care, support groups, and volunteer services. Some options include:Non-Profit Organizations:Groups like the Family Caregiver Alliance and National Alliance for Caregiving offer resources and information on finding caregiving support.Volunteer Programs:Services likeLotsa Helping Handsallow community members to volunteer, helping with meal prep, shopping, and more.Faith-Based and Community Programs:Many churches and local groups provide support through meals, companionship, and assistance with household tasks.Whether you need temporary relief or ongoing support, community-based resources can play a crucial role in providinglocal caregiver resourcesand easing some of the caregiving burdens.Financial Assistance for CaregiversThe financial costs of caregiving can add up quickly, makingfinancial aid for caregiversa significant consideration. There are several options for financial support:Government Assistance:Programs like Medicaid may cover some caregiving services. Additionally, certain states offer stipends for family caregivers, and you may qualify for tax credits.Grants and Non-Profit Aid:Organizations such as the Alzheimers Foundation offer grants to help cover caregiving expenses.Employer Benefits:Some employers offer paid leave, flexible schedules, or financial assistance for employees acting as caregivers.Understanding these options can help alleviate some financial stress, allowing you to focus more on your caregiving role.Emotional Support and Counseling for CaregiversProvidingemotional support for caregiversis as vital as physical help. Many caregivers experience stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation, which can take a toll on mental health. Emotional support options include:Therapy and Counseling:Talking with a therapist can offer coping strategies and a safe space to express your emotions.Support Groups:Connecting with other caregivers through support groups for caregivers can reduce isolation and provide practical advice.Helplines:Organizations such as the Caregiver Action Network provide helplines staffed by professionals who can offer guidance and emotional support.Prioritizing your emotional well-being is essential for maintaining resilience in caregiving.How to Find and Access Caregiver ResourcesWith so manycaregiving resourcesavailable, navigating them can feel overwhelming. Here are steps to access the help you need:Research Local Services:Check with local agencies, community centers, and online directories for nearby resources.Contact Your Insurance Provider:Some insurance plans cover services such as respite care or therapy for caregivers.Apply for Financial Aid:Utilize online platforms to explore and apply for grants, government programs, and non-profit assistance that support caregivers.By taking proactive steps, you can better manage your responsibilities and improve your quality of life as a caregiver.Caregiver Self-Care: Prioritizing Your HealthMaintaining your health and well-being is vital for effective caregiving. Practicingcaregiver self-careinvolves more than just rest; it includes activities and habits that support your overall mental and physical health:Stress Management:Incorporate techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness into your daily routine.Physical Health:Exercise regularly, maintain a balanced diet, and schedule regular health check-ups.Time for Yourself:Pursue hobbies or activities you enjoy to recharge emotionally and mentally.By taking time to care for yourself, you not only improve your own well-being but also become better equipped to provide care for your loved one.Caring for a loved one can be deeply fulfilling but also highly demanding. Remember that seeking support doesnt mean youre not capable; it means you recognize the importance of sustaining your own health to be the best caregiver possible.

One of the most common challenges caregivers face is asking for help. As you juggle the daily responsibilities of caregiving, you may find yourself thinking,If only I had some help.Yet, ironically, its often the caregivers themselves who hesitate to seek or accept support.So why is it so difficult to ask for help as a caregiver?How can you move past this resistance, ensuring that both you and your loved ones receive the care you need?To gain insight, we consulted two experts:Mark Yaffe, MD, an associate professor of family medicine at Montreals McGill University, andBarry Jacobs, PsyD, director of behavioral sciences for the Crozer-Keystone Family Practice Residency Program in Springfield, Pennsylvania.Common Struggles for CaregiversBarriers to Asking for HelpMany caregivers feel embarrassed about asking for help. Dr. Yaffe affirms, Congratulations, youre normal. He emphasizes that most family caregivers share this feeling, which is a valid emotional response to the pressures of caregiving. Studies indicate that only about one-third of caregivers accept help when it is offered. This hesitation can be rooted in feelings of shame, or fear of judgment from others, especially in tight-knit family structures where the expectation is to do it all yourself.Dr. Jacobs echoes these thoughts, highlighting that cultural and religious beliefs often reinforce the notion that seeking help equates to weakness. Statements like, Our family doesnt take handouts, or No one can care for my loved one as well as I do, are common. Caregivers may also feel that asking for help is admitting failure. However, not seeking support can lead to serious consequences, including caregiver burnout, emotional exhaustion, and even physical health problems.The Impact of Caregiver BurnoutCaregiver burnout is a very real risk for those who try to do it all without asking for help. Family caregivers, particularly for individuals with rare diseases, often experience chronic stress due to the continuous demands of caregiving. As Dr. Yaffe points out, Caregivers dont realize they are slowly being worn down by their circumstances.Prolonged exposure to caregiving responsibilities without respite increases the chances of burnout, which can manifest in physical symptoms like fatigue, sleep issues, and even increased risk of premature mortality. Caregivers are more likely to face health issues themselves, particularly if they ignore the cumulative stress of caregiving crises.Dr. Jacobs likens caregiving to a marathon: You mustreplenish yourselfalong the way. Helping yourself allows you to continue helping your loved one. Without addressing burnout through properrespite care for caregiversor professional caregiving assistance, the caregiver may find themselves unable to continue, which jeopardizes the care of their loved one.Practical Steps to Seek HelpOpening Up the DialogueOne of the biggest hurdles caregivers face is starting the conversation with their loved ones about needing help. Many care recipients may resist the idea of anyone else providing care. Dr. Yaffe encourages caregivers to have an open dialogue, explaining how caregiving responsibilities are affecting them. Its OK to tell your loved one that they dont have the right to take over your life, says Dr. Yaffe. Being honest about your emotional state and the need for assistance can create a stronger, more balanced caregiving relationship.Dr. Jacobs adds that loved ones need to understand they can support their caregiver byaccepting help from others. Sometimes, providing loving care means bringing someone else into the home, he notes. This might include professional caregiving assistance or home health agency support. Introducing external help doesnt diminish the care you provide but can allow you to focus on the most important aspects of caregivingspending quality time with your loved one.Accepting Respite Care and Professional HelpRespite care for caregivers is a vital tool for avoiding burnout. By taking short breaks and utilizing services such as community-based respite programs or hiring a professional caregiver, you can restore your energy and maintain your health. Many communities offer family caregiver support groups and resources to connect you with services like home health agencies, which specialize in providing part-time or full-time caregiving assistance.If you feel overwhelmed, you may benefit from exploring professional caregiving assistance. While it can be difficult to let someone else care for your loved one, Dr. Yaffe reassures caregivers that, Finding the right match takes time, but when you do, it can make all the difference. Professional help allows caregivers to delegate certain responsibilities and focus on providing emotional support and quality time for their loved one.Building a Support NetworkWhen looking for support, start with family, friends, and neighbors. Often, these individuals are eager to help but may not know how. Dont hesitate to reach out for assistance with tasks like grocery shopping, meal preparation, or transportation. Another valuable resource is connecting with other caregivers through online forums or support groups. Sharing experiences with others who are going through similar challenges can provide emotional support for caregivers.Additionally, consider turning to your local faith community. Congregational members may be willing to assist during difficult times and may even offer long-term help. Finally, community resources like professional caregiving agencies can be a long-term solution for ongoing assistance.Caregiver help is essential for your well-being and that of your loved one. Overcoming the initial reluctance to seek assistance can open the door to respite care, professional caregiving assistance, and emotional support. By embracing a support system and understanding that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness, you can continue to provide the best care for your loved one without sacrificing your own health.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Understanding how to manage caregiving family dynamics and getting siblings involved is crucial for balancing responsibilities and maintaining emotional health. This article will explore the common challenges family caregivers face, effective communication strategies, and practical solutions for managing caregiving challenges.Joanies Story: A Common Family Caregiving ScenarioJoanie assumed that when her mother, Marion, 82, fell ill, her siblings would unite to help. As the youngest of four children, Joanie lived closest, while her two brothers lived in the same state, and her sister had moved to California. Despite the distance, Joanie believed they would work together as a family.When Marion was diagnosed with a chronic heart condition and diabetes, Joanie immediately stepped in, managing her mothers medical needs and organizing home care after a hospital stay. However, when she reached out to her siblings, they responded with comments like, You live closer, or You were always the favorite. Joanie found herself suddenly facing the caregiving challenges alone, an experience common to manyfamily caregivers.Family Dynamics and Caregiving ChallengesJoanies situation is far from unique. According to a National Family Caregivers Association survey,76% of family caregiversreport not receiving consistent help from family members, with spouses receiving the least supportonly 16%. Family caregiving roles are often unevenly distributed, leaving one person to bear the brunt of caregiving responsibilities.Managing caregiving family dynamics can be emotionally exhausting, as old sibling rivalries, unresolved conflicts, and differing personal views resurface. In Joanies case, her siblings responses highlighted underlying family dynamics that complicated caregiving responsibilities.Factors Affecting Family Involvement in CaregivingSeveral factors contribute to family caregiving challenges, especially when siblings are involved:Personality and family roles:Some family members are naturally more inclined to take on caregiving roles, while others may struggle due to their personality or perceived roles within the family.Geographic distance:Siblings who live far away may feel disconnected or assume that the sibling living closest to the care receiver should handle everything.Work and family obligations:Caregiving can be difficult to manage alongside jobs, raising children, and maintaining personal lives.Licensed clinical social worker Beth MacLeod explains thatsibling caregiving dynamicsoften follow familiar patterns: some siblings step up, while others hold back, sometimes out of denial or fear of dependency. Understanding these family dynamics is the first step to creating family caregiving solutions.Solutions: How to Involve Family Members in CaregivingTo manage caregiving challenges, its crucial to address family dynamics head-on. Holding a family meeting is an effective way to start the conversation and ensure everyone is on the same page. Family meetings can be done in person, over the phone, or via online conferencing, and they provide a chance to distribute caregiving tasks fairly.MacLeod suggests bringing in a geriatric care manager or elder law attorney to facilitate these meetings. Professional guidance can help dispel misunderstandings about the illness or caregiving options, ensuring that siblings make informed decisions about their roles in family caregiving.Communication Strategies for Family CaregiversClear and open communication is critical for resolving family caregiving issues. Rather than making vague requests like, I wish youd help more, Joanie found that specific requestssuch as asking a sibling to take their mother to a dentist appointmentwere more effective.Sharing information about caregiving is also essential. Siblings who dont provide direct care can still contribute by managing finances or organizing services likeMeals on Wheels. Keeping everyone informed can help balance family caregiving roles.Focus on Communication, Not ResolutionSeattle-based counselor Wendy advises family caregivers to focus on improving communication rather than resolving every issue. By acknowledging and understanding each others viewpoints, siblings can avoid conflicts and work together to support their aging parents or loved ones. This shift in perspective allows family members to leverage each others strengths, even if full resolution is not possible.Positive Outcomes of Family CaregivingIn Joanies case, two of her three siblings eventually got involved. Together, they arranged home care, Meals on Wheels, and coordinated weekend visits, giving Joanie much-needed respite. Although she remained the primary caregiver, she felt supported and emotionally connected to her siblings, which made a significant difference in her caregiving journey.Caregiving can also provide emotional rewards. Over time, family caregiving can bring siblings closer, heal old wounds, and offer opportunities for personal growth. Adult children may step outside of their traditional family roles, surprising each other with new strengths and insights.What to Do if Siblings Dont Help with CaregivingIf some siblings remain uninvolved, its essential for family caregivers to seek outside support. Resources likeShare the Carehelp caregivers build networks of volunteers to share responsibilities and provide much-needed assistance. We providethese tipsfor finding a support group.In Joanies case, she hoped her fourth sibling would eventually come around, but in the meantime, she accepted help from her support network and found ways to manage the caregiving challenges. Caregivers like Joanie can also turn to caregiver support groups and respite programs for relief.Practical Tips for Caregivers Navigating Family DynamicsCommunicate openly:Have honest conversations with your siblings about caregiving responsibilities.Divide tasks fairly:Clearly define roles, and ask for specific help when needed.Seek outside help:Dont be afraid to involve professional counselors or caregiving experts to mediate family discussions.Be flexible:Understand that each sibling may have different capabilities or limitations when it comes to caregiving.Be forgiving:Family caregiving can bring up old emotions, but its important to approach the situation with understanding and patience.Ultimately, caregiving family dynamics require empathy, communication, and a willingness to adjust to new roles. While sibling caregiving may present challenges, the emotional rewards and strengthened family bonds are worth the effort.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

While some changes in life are anticipated and welcomed, the introduction of illness or disability into a family often comes without warning, fundamentally altering family dynamics and relationships. Understanding these changes and learning to navigate them is crucial for both caregivers and their loved ones.Understanding How Illness Changes Family DynamicsWhen a medical crisis occurs, family relationships inevitably change. The future changes, and the familys definition of itself changes with it. Dr. Jeri HepworthBob Cameron, a licensed clinical social worker at Baltimores Sinai Rehabilitation Hospital, likens illness or disability to the intrusion of an unwanted family member who has come to stay. Initially, family members focus their entire energy on managing the illness, often at the expense of maintaining balanced relationships.Coping with Lost Dreams and New RealitiesThe loss of ones dreams and the need to alter expectations of what life is going to be like can be a major cause of problems in family relationships. When illness or disability strikes, your vision of the future is turned upside down.Hearing the doctor say that Sally had muscular dystrophy was like a bullet in my heart. I saw all of my dreams for her future seep away. Steve KwartI always imagined mom and dad having a beautiful retirement, and then one day they would both just peacefully die in their sleep. I never dreamed dad would have Alzheimers, mom would have to care for him, and that Id be caring for them as well as my kids. Lily JordanPeople feel cheated, according to Ellen Luce, a family therapist with the Pastoral Counseling and Consultation Center of Greater Washington. Ms. Luce speaks from both professional and personal experience she has lupus, and her husband Donald has multiple sclerosis.Its no wonder people are angry, Ms. Luce asserts. Family members sometimes compound the problem by directing their anger at each other, thereby alienating those who love them the most.I sometimes suggest that people have a ceremony to grieve over the loss of their dreams. It lets them know its okay to be angry and to feel intense sadness. It can also speed them on the way to creating new dreams based on realities, and that really is the key to healing. Ellen Luce, Family TherapistBuilding new dreams is crucial to moving forward. Focusing on what is possible, as opposed to what is not, leads to individual growth, self respect, and development of relationships on a new footing. However, the caregiver and care receiver may not simultaneously be ready to build new dreams. Because of the altered situations in which they find themselves, they may first need to forge a new definition of self.Adapting to New Roles in CaregivingRole Reversals in Family RelationshipsWhen illness enters a family,roles often reversedramatically. Adult children become parents to their aging parents, while spouses must balance being both a caregiver and a partner. These role reversals can create complex emotional dynamics and strain relationships.Spousal Relationships Under StressFor couples, illness can significantly impact the balance between dependence and independence. The challenge of transitioning between caregiver and spouse roles can strain intimaterelationshipsand require careful navigation of new boundaries.Parental Caregiving ChallengesParents caring for ill or disabled children often struggle to maintain their own relationship while meeting their childs needs. The guilt and intensive focus on the child can lead to neglect of the spousal relationship, creating additional family stress.Strengthening Family Relationships In CaregivingMaintain open lines ofcommunication, even when conversations are difficultFind creative ways to preserve normalcy in relationshipsPractice self-carewhile caring for othersKeep your sense of humor and perspectiveMake conscious decisions about what you can and cannot controlIt didnt get better at first. In fact it got a whole lot worse. Problems we had before were magnified. However, I am convinced that we wouldnt have tried so hard to work things out if Dick hadnt been sick. We might even be divorced now. Im glad were not.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2025, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

As caregiving responsibilities grow, many caregivers find themselves grappling with changes in intimacy and the dynamics of their closest relationships. Understanding the emotional toll of caregiving and learning to navigate these challenges can help caregivers maintain stronger connections while caring for their loved ones.The Invisible Emotional Currency of CaregivingWhen illness or disability enters a family, it brings an invisible emotional expense that no insurance policy can cover. Caregiving introduces complex dynamics that erode traditional intimacy, creating profound psychological and relational challenges. The emotional stress of caregiving can gradually transform the most resilient relationships, leaving caregivers feeling isolated, frustrated, and emotionally depleted.Emotional Challenges Caregivers FaceSudden shifts in family roles and expectationsOverwhelming emotional and physical fatigueLoss of personal identity and independenceComplex feelings of love, resentment, and guiltTransforming Family Dynamics: When Roles ShiftCaregiving fundamentally disrupts familiar family rhythms. When a spouse becomes bedridden, a parent develops cognitive challenges, or a child loses independence, entire relationship ecosystems are redesigned. Caregivers often find themselves simultaneously mourning past relationship patterns while adapting to new, demanding roles.All of a sudden I became the primary breadwinner and had to take out the trash as well. I resented these added responsibilities. It seemed Tom was no longer the man I married. Ellen, CaregiverTheserole changes create significant stress, challenging established family dynamics and testing emotional resilience. Caregivers must navigate complex emotions while maintaining compassion and connection.The Silent Challenge: Sexual Intimacy in CaregivingSexual intimacy often becomes a profound casualty of caregiving. The physical and emotional demands of care can dramatically reduce opportunities for sexual connection. Fatigue, changed body dynamics, and the presence of medical challenges create significant barriers to maintaining sexual relationships.Caregivers frequently experience:Reduced physical and emotional energy for sexual connectionFeelings of guilt about sexual frustrationsChanges in physical attraction and relationship perceptionEmotional complexity surrounding physical intimacyIts not the sort of thing you just blurt out, notes Craig, whose wife suffers from chronic pain. Here she is living with constant pain, and Im complaining about my sexual frustration. It just doesnt seem right, even though the problem is very real.Strategies for Maintaining Emotional ConnectionSuccessfully navigating caregivings emotional landscape requires intentional strategies and compassionate communication. Experts recommend three key approaches:Enhance Independence:Encourage your loved one to maintain as many roles as possible. Sharing responsibilities preserves relational dignity.Communicate Openly:Discuss feelings candidly.

When do you plan on getting handicapped license plates? When are you going to sell that big house and come live with us?Getting someone to address a problem they refuse to acknowledge is challenging in any relationship. This situation becomes more significant when one person is disabled, chronically ill, or incapable of independent living. The consequences of this dynamic can be larger and more severe. Navigating this type of situation requires careful consideration and strategy.I get so frustrated, says Kathleen, caregiver to her husband Scott who has Lou Gehrigs disease. Every time I say that we really ought to talk about our finances, Scott changes the subject. I dont want to be a nag, but Ive got to get him to realize that we have to make plans for my future, and for the kids future too. Im afraid hell hate me if I act on my own, but I cant just wait around until hes ready. I need to do something. I feel so trapped by his inaction and manipulated by it as well.Denial Isnt Necessarily BadThis is a common caregiver complaint, and a very difficult situation because both parties are in pain.One tries to hide it with denial and the other wants to work through it and gain some control of his or her life. They are in different places, almost a different time zone in a sense, and so they cant hear what the other one is saying. This creates a disconnect between the two perspectives.Denial in and of itself isnt a bad thing. In fact, its a normal response to pain. It only becomes a problem if people dont work through it, move on, and start picking up the pieces of their lives.Denial gives people time to adapt and respond to significant life changes. It gives them time to overcome fear.Recognizing that denial is a normal coping mechanism probably wont blunt your frustration with your loved ones inaction. However, realizing that as individuals, we all cope with pain and loss differently, and at different speeds, can help you understand that you need to find a way to break through the denial so that constructive communication can occur.Showing You UnderstandFinding the way may well start with gaining a better appreciation of how the change in your loved ones life has affected his/her ability to deal with long-term issues or think about the concerns of others.One of the byproducts of being disabled by an illness or having an accident, etc. is the feeling of having been done to. It makes people feel very vulnerable and takes away their sense of empowerment says social worker Linda Samuel.Its hard for people to recognize that despite the initial occurrence they still have choices, many of them, and many decisions to make, too. They have to decide how they want to live the rest of their lives. Trying to convince them of that is a key element in breaking through the barriers theyve erected.Often people who are receiving help from others, or who have experienced a great loss, think that others, even their closest relatives and friends, cant possibly understand their situation. They become distrustful of any advice that is given.Empathetic Communication and Empowering ChoicesIts important therefore for caregivers to verbalize the fears their loved one may be feeling, to show they empathize with the situation, that they understand their loved one has suffered a great loss and may be frightened about the future. Samuel agrees and offers the following introduction to a conversation as an example:Mary, I know you wish things hadnt happened this way.Knowing you wish you hadnt been in that car accident is understandable. Knowing you are frightened is also completely valid. I am too in this situation. Wishing you were still fine and healthy is a natural response, but the fact is youre not, and we have to start finding out what our choices are moving forward.We have to start making decisions, so we can move on from here and live the rest of our lives as fully as possible.Convincing your loved one that he/she still does have some control over circumstances is an important part of the communication process. Words likechoice, options, possibilities, andalternativesare important words to use because they are action-oriented.Be Clear About Your Own Feelings and ObjectivesAs important as it is to empathize with your loved one, it is equally important, if not more so, to understand your own feelings. Set for yourself clear emotional goals. Understand what it is youre feeling and what you really want to achieve.When asked about what concerns propelled them to insist that their loved one take a particular action, caregivers answers seem to fall in one of three categories: a concern for the loved ones physical safety or mental well-being, a concern for some sort of security, or a strong desire not to have to make critical decisions alone.Im afraid she might go into a coma, said Bill, referring to his wife Sylvia. If she doesnt have a living will, what am I going to do? I dont want to have to decide how much or how little treatment she should receive. I want to know what she would want me to do.Christine and I are in our sixties now, noted Marty. Weve cared for Julia all her life, but when we are gone, shell need to live else where, have another guardian. Christine refuses to deal with the issue, and Im afraid well die before its been resolved. What will happen to Julia then?My father is the original macho man, explained Nancy. Despite the fact that he is 75 years old and recently had a heart attack, he insists that hes in perfect health. I only want him to wear a personal response buzzer, just in case some thing happens again. Im concerned that hell have another attack and it will be too late when someone finds him.Effective Family CommunicationLook closely at your own feelings and try to verbalize whats causing you to harp on a particular issue. Try to separate out the solutions to the problem form the issue itself, counsels psychologist Hammond. Its the underlying concern that is more likely to get them to respond to your request rather than your insistence on a particular action.If youve reached your limit with the consequences of inaction, its best to change the situation yourself. When making requests, frame them in terms of your own needs, as this is more likely to get a positive response.People tend to respond more easily to an emotional plea than they do to logic, suggests Dr. Hammond. By appealing to their concern for you, you are also helping your loved one move outside of themselves, Linda Samuel adds, because you are urging them to think about the impact of their inaction on other family members.WhenYou Cant Break ThroughBy acting, you reclaim your power and control, which is vital for your health and well-being. Moving beyond the status quo offers benefits like chipping away at barriers to your goals, reduced anxiety, and skill development. New possibilities may arise from your steps to change the troubling situation.The wordultimatumoften has negative connotations they noted. It suggests setting up a situation in which one person wins and the other loses. But an ultimatum need not be confrontational, especially when it is presented in terms of your own needs.I am so afraid every time you get behind the wheel of the car. Youve been so distracted lately and you just dont seem to have the concentration you used to. I am concerned you are going to hurt yourself, and others. I may not be able to stop you from driving, but I dont have to get in the car with you either. From now on, Ill take my own car instead of going with you.Obviously the preferred solution is for your loved one to work with you to find answers to the difficult problems you face, says Dr. Hammond, but if that doesnt seem possible, dont be afraid to do what you can by yourself.She adds that your own action might trigger the desired reaction. Nobody wants to be excluded from crucial decisions, especially adults.Strategies for Encouraging Collaboration in Challenging SituationsIf circumstances are such that you must continually act on your own, and if you are consistent in your behavior, sooner or later, Dr. Hammond contends your loved one is going to want to be part of the act to regain some self-determination.Let your loved one know how you feel and what you think needs to be done, the therapists we spoke with advise. Present your first solution one that includes active participation by both of you. Let your loved one know you want him/her to help solve your mutual problems.Be prepared to offer alternatives when possible. Note which of your suggestions include your loved one and which do not.Communicate your intent to act independently if necessary, explaining that the current situation is unsustainable for you.Whats To Be GainedActing on your own isnt a turning away from your current relationship or a disavowal of the other persons rights. Its rather an affirmation of yourself as an individual and your commitment to carrying on with life.Taking action helps you regain empowerment and control, benefiting your health and well-being. Moving beyond the status quo offers other benefits too. These include chipping away at barriers to your goals and feeling less anxious. Knowing something has been done reduces anxiety, and you also learn new skills. Additionally, new options may open up because you took steps to change the upsetting situation.Acting independently to address a problem affecting you and your family may not be your first choice. However, when coping with illness or disability, not all solutions will be perfect.The goal is to make the best of a difficult situation.By working toward breaking through the barriers of denial, thats exactly what youll be doing. It requires fortitude, empathy, concentration, self-awareness, and a whole lot more. If you manage to do it, even temporarily, you will have accomplished a great deal. I didnt realize what a rebirth I would feel, says the husband of a wife who has rheumatoid arthritis. Now that my wife is willing to work with me on finding solutions to the problems we face, life is a whole lot easier. Its a great relief to be able to turn off my broken record.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

For many caregivers, the familiar routines of shopping, spontaneous outings, or even sleeping in on weekends give way to new responsibilities.These changes can feel overwhelming, but defining anewnormalcy is an essential step in embracing the caregiving life.Redefining Normalcy in CaregivingFor caregivers, normal often takes on a new meaning. Nan, a caregiver and mother of two sons with cerebral palsy, emphasizes the importance of adjusting expectations. If you judge your life by comparing it to others, youll constantly feel like a failure, she explains. Instead, caregivers must create their own version of normalcy, tailored to their loved ones needs and their unique circumstances.Al, whose wife has multiple sclerosis, shared how he learned to embrace a new kind of normal. You cant plan a trip without thinking about bathroom access or mobility accommodations, he says. While these considerations can be challenging, they are part of the caregivers reality. Defining a new normalcy allows caregivers to approach life with resilience and adaptability.Balancing Caregiving Responsibilities and Personal LifeFindingbalance in caregivingis essential for maintaining mental health and overall well-being. Practical strategies can help caregivers juggle responsibilities while preserving personal time:Set realistic expectations:Understand that its impossible to do everything. Focus on the most important tasks.Utilize respite care:Many organizations, like theMS Society, offerrespite careservices to give caregivers a much-needed break.Prioritize time management:Block out dedicated time for caregiving, personal activities, and rest.Personal Stories from Caregivers: Brenda, Nan, and AlBrenda, a caregiver for her mother withAlzheimers, recalls seeing a t-shirt that read, Normal Is Dull. I thought, You should spend a day with us, she laughs. For Brenda, caregiving means adapting to a life far removed from conventional routines.Nan finds strength in focusing on small pockets of joy. I try to bring back something I used to enjoy, like reading or crafting, even if its just for an hour, she shares. This intentional effort to reclaim parts of her pre-caregiving life helps her maintain balance.Al took proactive steps to normalize parts of his life. Before retiring, he combined business trips with personal time, carving out opportunities to visit museums or take peaceful walks. Those moments gave me a life outside the sickroom, he reflects.Self-Care and the Importance of Personal TimeSelf-care is not a luxuryits a necessity for caregivers. You need to take snippets of time to recharge, advises Nan. From rediscovering old hobbies to simply enjoying a quiet cup of coffee, these small acts of self-care can make a big difference.Experts agree that self-care is essential for long-term caregiving. Dr. Hepworth encourages caregivers to prioritize their well-being, emphasizing, Youre not supposed to do this alone. Taking personal time enhances both the caregivers health and the quality of care they provide.Seeking Support: Friends, Family, and GroupsIsolation is a common challenge for caregivers, but reaching out for support can make a world of difference. Support groups provide a safe space to share experiences and gain insights. I was hesitant at first, says Al, but hearing other caregivers stories made me feel less alone.Whether through formal groups, friends, or family, having a support system is invaluable. Dr. Hepworth highlights the importance of allowing loved ones to help. Friends want to support you, not out of pity, but because they care, she says. By accepting their help, caregivers can lighten their load and strengthen their connections.Professional Insights on Caregiving and NormalcyExperts like Dr. Rolland and Dr. Hausman offer practical advice for caregivers striving to find normalcy. Dr. Rolland recommends seeking advice from peers in similar situations, while Dr. Hausman stresses the importance of structured time management. Quality time matters, she explains. Set aside uninterrupted periods for caregiving and personal activities.By following these recommendations, caregivers can navigate their responsibilities with greater ease and confidence.Processing Emotions: Sadness, Frustration, and GuiltCaregiving often brings a mix of emotions, from gratitude to frustration. Nan advises embracing these feelings through what she calls a pity party. Its okay to indulge in sadness for a bit, she says. Then, move forward with renewed energy.Professionals emphasize the importance of processing emotions without guilt. Dr. Hepworth reassures caregivers: Feeling upset doesnt make you a bad caregiver. It makes you human.Redefining a Normal LifeCaregiving may not be glamorous, but its deeply meaningful. Brenda, Nan, and Al all agree that normalcy doesnt have to disappearit just looks different. By embracing their new realities, seeking support, and prioritizing self-care, caregivers can find fulfillment and even joy in their journey.As Dr. Hepworth notes, Caregivers often find strengths they never knew they had. Defining anewnormalcy is about tapping into that strength and creating a life that works for you.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Speaking up helps solve our problems. Its how we learn and bring about change. During the course of a typical day, we probably speak up quite a bit.

We dont tell our children that we need help caring for their dad.Our children dont know we need help caring for their dad. To our boss, we dont request a more flexible schedule. Ignoring our instincts when speaking to medical professionals, we dont ask the right questions.Speaking up tends to be hard for family caregivers because we are often on uncertain ground. We question our knowledge and our actions. In addition, we often dont get to talk with other family caregivers to boost our confidence.How do we speak up?Confidence is essential, so we should tell ourselves, I can do this.Angernot too much, but enough to say, I am not going to take this anymore, or I cannot do this anymorecan be motivating.Knowledge empowers us to speak with authority.Believing that speaking up for our rights is crucial ensures we and our loved ones can navigate the difficult path of caregiving successfully.Here are some additional tips and suggestions:Believe in Yourself:Self-identify as a family caregiverLearn to say noCommand respect from healthcare providers and family membersProtect Your Health by Speaking Up for Your Right to:Recognition that caregiving is not a one-person job.Care coordination for your loved ones health records across all settings.Financial assistance so you can purchase some of the services you need to ease the burden of caregivingCommunity-based support designed to help caregiving families.Regular time-off from your responsibilities.Speak up for Your Rights and the Rights of ALL Family CaregiversInsist on education and training in skills you will need as a caregiver.Speak up for affordable homecare assistance.Speak up for financial support to protect you in later years.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

While you may not be a professional care manager, learning their strategies can transform your caregiving journey. Understanding care management for family caregivers can help you organize, coordinate, and provide better care while maintaining your own well-being.The Essential Role of Care Managers vs. Family CaregiversProfessional care managers, typically nurses or social workers, specialize in coordinating care rather than providing direct care. They excel at healthcare coordination for caregivers, connecting resources, and creating comprehensive care plans.

Their core responsibilities include:Gathering and coordinating medical information from multiple healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive careConducting thorough assessments of both the care recipient and their living environment to identify potential needs and challengesResearching and connecting with available community resources, including both public and private servicesFacilitating communication between healthcare providers, family members, and service providers to maintain consistent careDeveloping and adjusting care plans based on changing needs and circumstancesLearning to Think Like a Care Manager: A Guide for Family CaregiversImplementing family caregiver management strategies starts with creating a comprehensive assessment of your situation.

Its something that you really have to work at.Ive learned about myself in the role as caregiver that I can do things I never ever dreamed I would be able to do. I can give somebody a shot. That never in a million years would have crossed my mind.When Gary was injured I had worked in Winston Salem for 13 years at a law firm. And at that point, I could not be gone from 8:00 in the morning until 7:00 at night every single night and so I quit my job to stay home and take care of him. Thats the biggest life change Ive made.We used to be very active in the community, we went out a lot, we did a lot of things outside of the home, whereas now we dont go out as often as we do, we occasionally have friends over here and frequently watch movies, eat popcorn, just have our own little gathering in our own home.I do a lot of things for my husband. His memory is not very good so Im very involved with daily medication, cooking, cleaning as well as helping in his mobility, because he has major neuropathy in both feet so sometimes he cant feel where he is walking.I think hes had a difficult time transitioning into being dependent on anybody or anything. He was so independent for so long and did what he wanted to do and some of the things that he would want to do now are physically beyond what he is capable of.Since I became a caregiver, there are some things that have changed about me. I think I am probably more compassionate and more observant and more empathetic to the feelings he has physically and emotionally all the timeWhen you are responsible for caring for someone else, you have to force yourself, you have to make time to address your own needs. You cannot allow yourself to be 100% consumed in the caregiver aspect and neglect your own needs or you will get burned out and just, you cant do it.The most helpful resources for me have been the community of caregivers that Im friends with because these are the people that understand what you are dealing with I have a book club that I go to that sometimes talks about books and sometimes talks about other stuff but its, you know, its a gathering of my friends talking about something other than home. I like to recharge my batteries. I go, actually one of my favorites is to go get a pedicure. Its just so relaxing and you dont have to talk to anybody, you just sit there.Caring for a loved one is a deeply rewarding but challenging role. Caregivers often face significant stress, making self-care and taking breaks vital for overall well-being. Understanding how to manage caregiver stress and prioritize self-care can help prevent burnout and ensure you remain effective and healthy.Understanding Caregiver StressCaregiver stress arises from the physical, emotional, and mental demands of caring for a loved one. It can be overwhelming, especially when juggling caregiving responsibilities with other life obligations. Recognizing signs of caregiver stress and burnout is crucial for timely intervention.Signs of Caregiver Burnout:Persistent feelings of fatigue or exhaustionIncreased irritability or mood swingsDifficulty sleeping or changes in sleep patternsFeelings of isolation or lonelinessPhysical symptoms like headaches or gastrointestinal issuesThese signs indicate that stress levels may impact your health and effectiveness as a caregiver. Addressing these issues early can help prevent more severe burnout.Why Breaks MatterTaking regular breaks is essential for maintaining health and preventing burnout. Breaks allow caregivers to recharge, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being.Benefits of Taking Breaks:Physical Health:Regular breaks can prevent physical strain and exhaustion.Mental Health:Time away from caregiving duties helps refresh your mind and reduce anxiety.Emotional Well-Being:Breaks offer a chance to reconnect with personal interests and relationships, fostering a sense of balance and joy.Easy Ways to Take BreaksSet BoundariesEstablishing clear boundaries is a fundamental part of caregiver stress management. Learn to say no when necessary and set limits on caregiving tasks to avoid overextending yourself. Communicating your limits to family members and seeking their support can help share responsibilities more evenly.Quick Daily BreaksIncorporate short breaks into your daily routine to manage stress effectively. Simple activities like a brief walk, a few minutes of deep breathing exercises, or a quick stretch can significantly improve your mood.Longer BreaksPlanning for longer breaks is crucial for comprehensive caregiver self-care. Whether its a day off, a weekend getaway, or a vacation, stepping away from caregiving responsibilities allows you to unwind and rejuvenate fully. Make arrangements for respite care or seek help from family and friends during these breaks.Relaxing ActivitiesEngaging in relaxing activities can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. Consider activities such as:Reading:Escape into a good book to relax and unwind.Walking:Enjoying nature can be therapeutic and calming.Hobbies:Pursuing interests like gardening, painting, or crafting can provide joy and relaxation.Self-Care TipsPhysical CareMaintaining your physical health is essential for effective caregiving. Ensure you:Eat Well:Follow a balanced diet to support overall health.Exercise Regularly:Incorporate physical activity to manage stress and maintain energy levels.Get Adequate Sleep:Prioritize rest to recover and stay alert.Mental CareSupport your mental health through practices like:Meditation:Engage in mindfulness or meditation to reduce stress.Counseling:Seek professional counseling or therapy if needed.Hobbies:Dedicate time to activities that bring you joy and relaxation.Emotional CareNurture your emotional well-being by:Staying Connected:Maintain relationships with friends and family.Seeking Support:Join caregiver support groups to share experiences and gain insights.Finding HelpDont hesitate to ask for help. Support is available through various resources:Support Groups:Joining acaregiver support groupcan provide valuable insights and emotional support. The Caregiver Action Network offers a Facebook group to connect with others in similar situations.Respite Care:Look intorespite care servicesto take temporary breaks from caregiving duties.By incorporating these strategies and prioritizing self-care, you can effectively manage caregiver stress and maintain your overall health and well-being. Remember, taking care of yourself is essential to being the best caregiver you can be.Creating New RoutinesA caregiver describes taking on new responsibilities as her husband ages with COPD.WATCH VIDEOHelp SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

The disease affects over 24 million Americans and ranks as the third leading cause of death in the United States.Are you caring for a loved one with COPD? You can find comfort in knowing that you are not alone by listening to the experiences of your fellow caregivers in the CAN network.You may find new ways to help your loved one manage and cope with the disease, as well as advice on how to balance the many responsibilities of being a caregiver.Click to Read Video TranscriptDiane Africk introduces herself and her husband who has COPD.Diane Africk:My name is Diane Africk. I take care of my husband, Richard Africk. And he has COPD.There are several things that Ive had to take over since hes been diagnosed. The first and the most devastating one for Richard wasI had to drive. I had to do all the driving for us.I have to do all the shopping myself. He used to go shopping with me, and we would both, uh, pick out things, whatever we wanted.I have to do that myself now. It makes it difficult. I have to bring the groceries up. Its more physical too. Not only is it different mentally but its physically more taxing.Ive always been the kind of person who does things myself for myself. And with the progression of his COPD, I have found that I have to have some help. So I did get a caregiver for a few hours a day, just as a relief. I still feel totally responsible for him. Ah, hes my husband of 61 years.The one that Ive also found very helpful is the V.A. V.A. offers caregivers for depending on the situation, how much care the person needs.And that is amazing. Theres no charge for that. And its absolutely amazing that you can have somebody to go grocery shopping, to get your hair done, to, to do whatever you need to do, to go to your own doctor appointments. For years I was taking him with me to my doctor appointments, because I didnt want to leave him home alone. I dont have to do that. So that is the best resource of anyone whos been a veteran, to definitely call the V.A.As a caregiver, Im not surprised at many things that I do. Because its my nature.The one thing I did realize is that whatever Im going through is worse for him. Its worse for many people. So I can do this. I have to do this. My only other solution is to give up. And I dont give up.Well, I prioritize. And whatever need is the most urgent gets taken care of first. This is how I am able to take care of his needs and my needs. And I think this is important because I dont want to completely neglect my own needs.I dont know that you always know whats ahead in COPD. So as much as you want to be prepared, the best thing I could say is, realize that at some time things are going to change, and be flexible.I dont blame him for anything. He is, believe me, suffering more than I suffer. And its his positive attitude that keeps me going. He always has a smile.Taking a Time-outHear a woman share how she finds time for herself after becoming a caregiver changed her life.WATCH VIDEOHelp SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Asking for help as a caregiver can feel daunting. However, building a strongcaregiving support networkis crucial to navigating emergencies and maintaining well-being.Seeking help not only lightens the load but fosters meaningful connections that ensure reliable support during critical moments.A Caregivers Journey: Stevens StoryMy husband, Steven, has multiple sclerosis, a condition that has gradually taken away his ability to walk. At just 58 and 135 lbs., he is unable to manage on his own when his legs give out. These moments often occur during transitions, such as moving from the toilet to his wheelchair. In our small, non-ADA-compliant bathroom, these situations are especially challenging.On several occasions, Ive relied on our neighbor Allen, a tall and strong man who lives across the street. Whether Steven has slipped onto the cold tile floor or needs assistance during a feverish episode, Allen has always come to the rescue. At just 51 and 109 lbs., I simply dont have the strength to lift Steven on my own.Caregivers like me often need a reliable neighbor or helper to step in during such emergencies.The Importance of Reliable Neighbors in CaregivingAllen has been my white knight, always ready to help at a moments notice. With his busy travel schedule, it amazes me how often he is available. In instances where Allen isnt home, our next-door neighbor Tony steps in. Tony may not be as tall as Allen, but his strength and willingness to assist are invaluable.When Stevens fever spiked to 102 degrees one morning, I called Tony at 6:30 AM. Without hesitation, he helped me get Steven into his wheelchair so we could rush to the hospital. His quick action and genuine concern highlighted the importance of having dependable neighbors in caregiving emergencies.Building a Caregiving Support NetworkCreating a strongcaregiver support systemdoesnt happen by chance; it requires proactive effort. Here are some steps to ask for help as a caregiver and establish a reliable network:Identify Potential Helpers:Reach out to neighbors, friends, or community members who may be willing to assist during emergencies.Communicate Needs Clearly:Share your story and explain specific tasks where you might need help.Establish Contact Points:Ensure you have updated contact information for each person in your network.Utilize Local Services:Dont hesitate to call emergency services, like the fire department, when in need. Many are more than willing to assist caregivers.By investing time in building a caregiving support network, you ensure theres always someone to rely on when unexpected challenges arise.Overcoming the Fear of Asking for HelpPride and fear can make asking for help as a caregiver feel like admitting failure. However, embracing vulnerability is essential.Sharing your strugglesallows others to understand your needs and opens the door for emotional support.Its important to remember that people often want to help but dont know how. Be specific in your requests and express heartfelt gratitude after receiving assistance. Letting others into your life creates a sense of shared purpose and helps alleviate the loneliness that many caregivers face.Building a caregiving support network not only strengthens your ability to care for a loved one but also provides you with the emotional strength to continue your journey. Whether its a reliable neighbor, a close friend, or even emergency services, finding your Allen or Tony can make all the difference.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

People with chronic diseases or disabilities take more medications than any other group of patients. With the number of medications some patients take, the issue of medication management and can easily become overwhelming. Good health outcomes are three times less likely for patients who do not take medications correctly as compared to those that do. Improper use of medications causes 18 million emergency room visits per year.Maintain an up-to-date medication listKeep an up-to-date list of all the medications doctors have prescribed for your care recipient. Also, list over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Be sure to list the name, dosage, and frequency of the medication, the reason for taking it, any dosing directions, the start date, and when appropriate, the end date.For prescription drugs, add the name and phone number of the prescribing doctor and the pharmacy that filled the prescription.Include your loved ones name and emergency contact information. Also, note any allergies or other significant medical information.Make multiple copies: one for you to carry, one for your care recipients patient file, one on the refrigerator for paramedics to find in an emergency, and one for the primary doctor.A simple computer-based document is one of the easiest ways to keep the record current.Translate hand-written prescriptionsDont be shy about asking all doctors to translate their handwriting so you can have a record of what they prescribed and whyWrite the condition treated on each medicine bottleYou might find that your care recipient is taking three different pills for the same condition, each prescribed by a different physician. That may be precisely what is needed, but it is a red flag to alert you to ask questions.Use the same pharmacy when possibleIf you do, there will be an official record of all prescription medications over an extended period. This can be a vital timesaver during an emergency.Develop a strong rapport with your pharmacist and let him/her know you value their advice. The pharmacist is a great resource. Ask your pharmacists advice about over-the-counter medications and if they may react with prescription medications.Understand potential side effects and interactions and monitor interactionsAsk the doctor and pharmacist about potential side effects and interactions with other drugs, vitamins, or foods.Learn what to do if a dose is accidentally skipped.Come up with an easy way to manage medications dailyUse pill boxes or other technology to monitor and manage dosesUse auto-refill programs when availableWhat Should be on the Medication List?Name of drug generic and brand namesDoseStart and stop datesWhat the pill/capsule/liquid looks likeA record of any side effects experiencedWhat the drug is treatingInstructionsHow and when to take the medicationWhat not to do when taking the medicationOver the Counter medications and supplements with their dosesDrug and other allergiesDrugs to which you experienced a negative reaction (couldnt tolerate it)Recently completed prescriptionsName/contact info of prescribers (physician/physician assistant/nurse practitioner, etc.)Name/contact info for the pharmacy that filled the prescription(s)Safe Disposal of Unused MedicationsOption 1: Returning to PharmacySome pharmacies, clinics, or even hospitals may accept unused medications. You can check for a facility atwww.disposemymeds.org. Some (but not all) police departments or fire stations will accept unused medication on National Prescription Take Back Day, on October 27.Option 2:Mail-in EnvelopesMany pharmacies sell postage-paid special envelopes for you to return unused medications to a safe disposal facility.Option 3: Disposal KiosksMany pharmacies have secure kiosks where you can safely deposit unused medications. Remove personal information, and drop unused medicines in the slot!Option 4: NeutralizingPurchase specialty charcoal-activated medication disposal bags. After placing the medications in the bag, add water and seal. The drugs, including opioids, will be rendered inert and inactive. These bags can then be placed safely in the trash, and you can have peace of mind knowing that the drugs will not enter the water supply or be easily abused or diverted.NOTE:Mostmedicationsshould not be flushed, but there are a small number that should. Check with the pharmacist to find out if medications should or should not be flushed. Be extremely cautious if you choose to place unused medications in the trash. Children, pets, and those addicted to opioids can fish medications out of the trash, even if combined with coffee grounds or kitty litter.Effective medication management is essential for caregiver success. By maintaining a comprehensive medication list, understanding medication interactions, and safely disposing of unused medications, caregivers can better support their loved ones health and safety.

In the demanding role of family caregiving, its essential to take time for self-care and rejuvenation.Without respite,caregivers often experience burnout. Respite care offers vitaltemporary relieffor primary caregivers, helping them rest and recharge from thecontinuous demandsof looking after someone with special needs. Whether planned or in an emergency, respite care may take place in the home or elsewhere, ranging from a few hours to a couple of weeks. Its goal is to ensure caregivers remember that theres life beyond caregiving.Respite is about You.(Having someone stay with your loved one while you do the grocery shopping is not respite. Its help.)What Are Your Options for Respite Care?After deciding that you need respite, you might wonder: what are the options? The landscape of respite care services has been evolving, with more recognition and support for caregivers. There is now more understanding of the importance of this assistance at both the state and national levels.The National Family Caregivers Support Program, for example, offers funding for respite advice and services, and many community programs provide more flexible services than ever before. Here are some of the respite care options available:Respite Services in Your Own HomeFor most caregivers, the preferred option is someone coming into the home to give them time off. Family members might meet this need, or you can reach out to volunteer groups or home health care agencies. The choice depends on the skill level required and your ability to pay for the service.Volunteer Caregivers:Volunteers are becoming an increasingly common resource. Organizations like theNational Volunteer Caregiving Network(formerly Interfaith Caregivers Alliance) connect volunteers with caregivers in need. These volunteers offer non-medical help such as meal preparation, transportation, and light housekeeping. They provide not only practical assistance but also emotional support, offering caregivers companionship and a break from their daily tasks.Home Health Care Agencies:If you need more specialized care, consider working with a home health care agency. For example,Visiting Nurse Associations of America(VNAA) provide non-profit, Medicare-certified care, although respite care is not covered by health insurance and will likely require out-of-pocket payment.Respite in Day CentersIf home care isnt the solution, you may want to explore day services available in your area. Programs such as those offered byEaster Sealsprovide both social and medical support in a structured, community setting. These programs often serve individuals with special needs, offering a safe environment where they can participate in activities while their caregivers take a break. Day centers can be an excellent option to meet both social and medical needs, while also helping caregivers maintain their own health and well-being.Respite Care Overnights and Residential OptionsFor longer periods of respite, caregivers may turn to overnight stays or residential respite care, where the person being cared for stays in a facility such as a nursing home or group home. This can provide caregivers with the time they need to travel, address their own health needs, or simply enjoy a longer period of rest.Expanding Respite Care ServicesThough options are growing, the demand for respite services continues to outpace supply.The National Respite Coalition (NRC)is working to expand respite options throughLifespan Respite programs, which help caregivers find short-term relief. States like Oregon, Nebraska, and Wisconsin are leading the way, and others are following their example. These programs aim to centralize resources and funding, making it easier for caregivers to find the support they need.In a state with a Lifespan Respite program, one phone call to a social worker, area aging council, family social service agency or similar organization will enable the caller to find all local respite options, along with information on how respite might be funded. The information covers all types of service, all means of financing, for all ages and conditions of care, and places the power of choice in the hands of the caregiver. NRC sees a future in which caregivers can find what they need without dozens of phone calls and dead-end efforts. But until Lifespan Respite becomes a reality, persistence is necessaryOvercoming Obstacles to Respite CareMany caregivers face emotional and psychological barriers that prevent them from seeking respite. Deep fears about the adequacy of care for their loved one, concerns about trust, and guilt are all common challenges. Its essential for caregivers to acknowledge these fears and seek reliable respite care early. This can ensure they receive the support they need without feeling overwhelmed or isolated.The Importance of Respite: A Key to Successful CaregivingRemember that respite care keeps you going it is a necessity, not a luxury. Respite care is necessary for maintaining the health and well-being of caregivers. By embracing the support available, caregivers can rejuvenate themselves, reduce stress, and continue providing compassionate care. Taking time for respite helps caregivers stay healthy, balanced, and emotionally available for their loved ones. With more respite care options than ever, finding the right support is within reach.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Both are essential for managing the caregiver burden and ensuring the well-being of family caregivers.Acknowledging the Need for HelpCaregiving is a demanding responsibility, often requiring round-the-clock attention.According to a survey conducted by the Caregiver Action Network, 65% of family caregivers do not receive consistent help from other family members. This imbalance can lead to caregiver burnout and overwhelming stress. Recognizing that caregiving is too big a task to undertake alone is the first step toward finding help for family caregivers.Why Caregivers Struggle to Ask for HelpMany caregivers find it difficult to ask for help.Feelings of guilt, perfectionism, and fear of burdening others often hold caregivers back. Some believe that no one else can perform caregiving tasks as well as they can. These emotional barriers contribute to the isolation many caregivers experience, intensifying the challenges of managing caregiving responsibilities.Step 1: Creating a Task ListTo get the help you need, start by creating a detailed caregiver task list.Write down all caregiving tasks you handle daily, from cooking meals and managing medications to transportation and household chores. Categorize these tasks into groups such as personal care, financial management, and household maintenance. This caregiving task list will serve as the foundation for organizingcaregiving responsibilitiesand identifying areas where help is needed.Step 2: Prioritizing and Delegating TasksOnce your caregiving task list is complete, review it to identify tasks you dislike or find particularly stressful.Prioritize tasks based on their importance andtime demands, and determine which ones can be delegated. Delegating caregiving tasks doesnt diminish your role as a caregiver; instead, it ensures that essential responsibilities are met without overburdening you.For example, a family member might assist with transportation or grocery shopping, while a professional caregiver can help with personal care tasks. By sharing caregiving responsibilities, you can focus on tasks that require your unique skills or provide personal fulfillment.Step 3: Asking for Help with Your ListArmed with your caregiving task list, reach out to others for assistance. Sharing your organized list demonstrates your resourcefulness and clarity about your needs. Start by approaching family members, friends, or community caregiver support resources. Use the task list as a tool to explain your situation and make specific requests for help.Finding Help When You Feel IsolatedIf you dont have immediate support from family or friends, consider alternative resources.Local caregiver support groups, faith-based organizations, or employee assistance programs can connect you with people willing to help. Online forums and caregiving networks also provide emotional support and practical advice for caregivers feeling isolated.Emotional Benefits of Sharing Your NeedsAsking for help not only reduces your caregiving workload but also alleviates feelings of isolation.Sharing your caregiving challenges with others fosters connection and emotional support. This can reduce caregiving stress,enhance your well-being, and improve your ability to manage caregiving duties effectively.Now Take the First StepCaregiving is a challenging journey, but you dont have to navigate it alone. Start by creating your caregiver task list, prioritizing responsibilities, and reaching out for help. Whether you find support from family, friends, or caregiving resources, taking action today will enhance your caregiving experience and improve the quality of life for both you and your loved one.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Its as if there is a gray cloud that hovers over everything I do.Decision-making has become so frightening for me. I think Im losing my mind.I wish I could sleep forever.If you recognize these feelings in yourself and feel this way day after day, month after month, even year after year, you may be suffering from something more than a simple case of the blues. You may have a mood disorder and you may be suffering from depression.Many caregivers, whose lives have been radically and unexpectedly changed by caring for an ill or disabled loved one, slip into depression disorders. Virtually half of the respondents to an NFCA caregiver survey said they had experienced prolonged depression because of their caregiving responsibilities.That may not make you feel any better, but heres something that will. Depression is an illness, and it can be cured. You dont have to go through the rest of your life feeling sad and miserable. Here is a look at the types of depression you may experience as a caregiver, and how you can get help.Types of DepressionCaregivers are often vulnerable to two primary types of depression: dysthymic disorder and major depression.Dysthymic Disorder (DO):This mild yet persistent form of depression includes feelings of sadness, anxiety, and low energy. Symptoms often include difficulty concentrating, changes in appetite, and disturbed sleep. Left untreated, DO can persist for years, affecting every aspect of life.Major Depression:A more severe condition, major depression often renders caregivers unable to function. Symptoms such as hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness, and even suicidal thoughts can take a profound toll. Treatment is essential for managing this debilitating condition.Emotional and Physical ImpactDepression in caregivers often manifests as both emotional and physical symptoms. Many caregivers report headaches, chronic fatigue, and back pain caused by the prolonged stress of caregiving responsibilities. Emotionally, they may experience unrelenting sadness and a sense of loss, which can lead to a reduced quality of life.Unaddressed caregiver depression can escalate into caregiver burnout, characterized by overwhelming exhaustion and detachment from caregiving tasks.Seeking helpearly can prevent these outcomes.Why Caregivers Are Prone to DepressionCaregiving can be isolating. While the focus often remains on the care recipient, caregivers emotional needs are overlooked. Many caregivers feel unappreciated, leading to feelings of resentment and sadness. This, combined with the demanding nature of caregiving duties, increases susceptibility to depression.Statistically, women are more likely to be caregivers and are also more prone to depression, further highlighting the emotional toll of caregiving.To help gauge what feelings you may be experiencing and if they relate to depression, take thisdepression self-assessment screening.Seeking Help for DepressionRecognizing the signs of depression is the first step. Symptoms such as prolonged sadness, changes in appetite or sleep, and feelings of hopelessness should not be ignored. Start by reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, and consider speaking with a healthcare provider.Professional help is essential. Therapists such as psychiatrists, psychologists, or licensed social workers can guide caregivers toward recovery. Early intervention can prevent depression from worsening.Finding the Right TreatmentTherapies like cognitive therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy are effective for treating caregiver depression. Cognitive therapy focuses on changing negative thought patterns, while interpersonal psychotherapy addresses social and emotional factors contributing to depression.For more severe cases, medication may be necessary to balance chemicals in the brain. Consult a psychiatrist for appropriate guidance. Remember, treatment plans can vary, and finding the right combination may take time.Life After DepressionRecovery from depression is not only possible butcan also be transformative. Therapy and self-care can help caregivers rediscover a sense of purpose and joy. Many find that overcoming depression strengthens their resilience and empathy.If you are struggling, know that help is available, and a fulfilling life beyond depression is within reach. Caregiving is a journey, and maintaining your mental health is essential for providing the best care for your loved one.If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of caregiver depression, seek help today. Professional resources and treatment options can lead to recovery and a brighter future.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Advance directives are legal documents that outline an individuals healthcare preferences in situations where they cannot communicate those wishes. This article explores the various types of advance directives, their importance, and how to set them up to ensure your loved ones wishes are respected.What Are Advance Directives?Advance directives refer to any legal documents related to healthcare decisions, ensuring that individuals can express their preferences regarding medical treatments and interventions. These documents include living wills, healthcare powers of attorney, and Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders. By establishing these directives, individuals can communicate their healthcare wishes to family members and healthcare providers, alleviating the burden of decision-making during critical times.Why Are Advance Directives Important?Advance directives are vital in ensuring that healthcare decisions align with an individuals values and preferences. By preparing these documents in advance, individuals can:Ensure their wishes are known and respected, even when they cannot communicate.Relieve family members from the stress of making difficult healthcare decisions during emotional times.Prevent unwanted medical treatments that may not align with their values.Facilitate discussions about end-of-life care planning, promoting better understanding among family members.Types of Advance DirectivesThere are several types of advance directives, each serving a unique purpose in end-of-life care planning:1. Living WillA living will is a legal document that specifies an individuals healthcare preferences in the event they become unable to communicate. This includes decisions regarding life-prolonging treatments, organ donation, and end-of-life care. Living wills take effect only when the individual is terminally ill or incapacitated, as defined by state law.2. Healthcare Power of Attorney (HCPA)A healthcare power of attorney allows individuals to designate a trusted person to make healthcare decisions on their behalf if they cannot communicate. This ensures that someone who understands their values and wishes can advocate for them during critical situations.3. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) OrderA DNR order specifies that no resuscitative measures should be taken if the individuals heart stops or they stop breathing. This order only applies in situations where the individual is unable to communicate their wishes, typically due to severe medical conditions.4. Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST)MOLST, or Physicians Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), provides immediate medical orders based on the individuals current health status. Unlike a living will, MOLST takes effect as soon as it is signed by a physician, ensuring healthcare providers respect the individuals current treatment preferences.How to Set Up an Advance DirectiveCreating an advance directive involves several key steps:Research State Laws:Each state has specific laws regarding advance directives, including the requirements for creating and revoking them. Familiarize yourself with these laws to ensure your documents are legally binding.Choose Your Advocate:For documents like a healthcare power of attorney, select someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf.Discuss Your Wishes:Communicate your preferences with your advocate and family members.

We will concentrate on schizophrenia as an illness and the challenges family caregivers face, emphasizing the importance of early family engagement in the diagnosis and treatment process.Today, well hear from three presenters, each offering unique perspectives and expertise. Feel free to submit questions at any time during the 90 minutes using the chat function. If we dont get to your question, well follow up afterward.Caregiver Action Network is a nonprofit organization that serves the nations 90 million family caregivers, providing free resources and support. Todays focus on mental health challenges, especially schizophrenia, reflects the feedback weve received from families. We know mental health issues affect the whole family, and with schizophrenia, patients may even refuse the involvement of a family caregiver. Early family engagement, however, can lead to much better outcomes in the long term, as treatment started before or after a psychotic episode has a higher likelihood of success.There are several treatment options that caregivers may not be aware of, including long-acting injectables that can be administered monthly or even every three months. This provides alternatives to daily medication and may help families who struggle with ensuring their loved one stays on track with treatment.We also introduced a resource calledBlueprint for Families of Loved Ones with Mental Health Issues., which addresses four main areas: medication management, privacy issues like HIPAA, tips for communicating with healthcare professionals, and connecting with other caregivers. Additionally, we recommendChoicesInRecovery.com, a comprehensive resource sponsored by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which offers useful tools for caregivers and patients alike.Our first presenter is Paul Gionfriddo, CEO ofMental Health America. Paul brings a personal perspective, having a son with schizophrenia, and will discuss the importance of early identification and intervention before stage four mental illness. He shares his experience with his son, Tim, who showed symptoms at age 5 but wasnt diagnosed until 16, highlighting the critical role early detection could play in changing outcomes.Next, well hear from Chrissa Hickey, a parent and advocate for mental health, whose son Timothy was diagnosed with childhood-onset schizophrenia at age 11. Chrissa talks about the struggles of raising a child with severe mental illness and how earlier diagnosis and intervention have helped stabilize her son, who now lives in his own apartment.Finally, Isa Kelleher from theNational Council for Behavioral Healthwill introduceMental Health First Aid, a groundbreaking program designed to teach non-clinicians how to provide initial support during a mental health crisis. Isa emphasizes the importance of identifying symptoms early and discusses the importance of educating families on the treatment options available, such as long-acting injectables and therapy.Throughout this webinar, we hope you gain insights into how family engagement, early diagnosis, and treatment can make a substantial difference in managing schizophrenia. Thank you for joining us, and remember to explore the resources weve shared for continued support.Understanding Familys Critical Role in Schizophrenia ManagementSchizophrenia is a complex mental health condition that profoundly impacts not just individuals, but entire families.

Protecting sensitive health information is crucial for ensuring trust between patients and healthcare providers. For those receiving mental health treatment, confidentiality can greatly impact their willingness to seek and maintain care. This guide will explain the importance of HIPAA in mental health care, including how patient rights are protected, when disclosures can be made, and what it means for caregivers.HIPAA BasicsHIPAA is a federal law enacted to ensure the protection of personal health information while also promoting the use of electronic health records to improve efficiency in healthcare. One of the key components of HIPAA is the Privacy Rule, which regulates how healthcare providers, insurance companies, and other covered entities handle and share health information. For individuals dealing with mental health issues, HIPAA plays an essential role in providing a sense of security that their health records are being treated with the utmost care and confidentiality.HIPAA & Mental HealthHIPAA has specific provisions to protect the confidentiality of mental health information. The law recognizes that mental health treatment involves highly sensitive information, and therefore, mental health records are subject to strict confidentiality rules. This means that healthcare providers must be particularly cautious in how they handle information about psychiatric treatments, therapy notes, and medication. Only authorized individuals, such as healthcare professionals involved in the patients care, can access this information, ensuring privacy and confidentiality for mental health patients.Additionally, there are limits to what information can be shared, even with family members. In most cases, providers need explicit patient consent to disclose mental health information, including diagnosis and treatment plans. This high level of privacy aims to protect patients from discrimination and stigma, allowing them to seek the care they need without fear of exposure.Patient Rights Under HIPAAUnder HIPAA, patients have specific rights regarding their health information, including mental health records. These rights ensure that individuals are informed about how their information is used and give them control over their data. Some of the key rights under HIPAA for mental health patients include:Access to Records: Patients have the right to access their mental health records, including medical notes, treatment plans, and any other information recorded by their healthcare provider. The right to access allows patients to stay informed and engaged in their care.Requesting Corrections: If a patient identifies inaccuracies in their mental health records, they have the right to request amendments. This ensures that the medical records are up-to-date and reflect the patients health accurately.Right to Know How Information is Shared: Patients are entitled to a notice that describes how their health information is used and shared, and they can request a list of individuals or organizations that have accessed their records.Disclosure of Mental Health InformationHIPAA allows healthcare providers to share mental health information in specific circumstances, even without patient consent. These exceptions are in place to protect patients and others from harm, ensuring that patient privacy does not hinder necessary care or safety. Key guidelines for sharing mental health information without patient consent include:Emergencies and Risk of Harm: If a healthcare provider believes that the patient poses an imminent risk to themselves or others, they can disclose relevant health information to prevent harm. This could include contacting family members or law enforcement.Incapacitation: If a patient is unable to make decisions for themselves, healthcare providers may share relevant information with family members or other responsible parties to ensure appropriate care.Coordination of Care: When necessary, providers may share limited information with caregivers or other individuals involved in a patients care, particularly if the patient has verbally agreed, is incapacitated, or in the providers judgment, it is in the patients best interest.HIPAAs provisions for mental health care help strike a balance between ensuring privacy for patients and allowing the appropriate use of information in specific situations, which is essential for quality healthcare and patient safety. Understanding the basics of HIPAA for mental health, patient rights, and information disclosure guidelines helps both patients and caregivers navigate their rights and responsibilities effectively. For more detailed information, you can refer toCANs Crisis Symptom Reporting Guide,CANs Rare Caregivers resources, and theCaregiver Help Desk.What to Know About HIPAA & How to Discuss HIPAA with Your Loved OneDo I need to have legal medical decision-making authority in order for my loved one's doctor or therapist to talk to me?No. Health care providers may speak with you or any other family or friends supporting your loved one when any one of the following apply:Your one loved has given permission to their doctor or therapist.The doctor or therapist has determined that there is a serious or imminent threat to your loved ones health or safety, and you (or others) are able to minimize this threat.Your loved one is incapacitated.What information is my loved one's doctor or therapist able to share with me or other family members or friends involved in their care?The health information your loved ones doctor or therapist can share with you or others is limited to what your loved one has given permission for them to share, OR what the doctor or therapist has determined is directly relevant to your or others role in your loved ones care.Does my loved one's doctor or therapist need to have a written or verbal authorization on record in order for them to share relevant health information with me?No. Your loved ones doctor or therapist can share relevant health information to you without any release authorization on record in any situation where they believe it is in the best interest of your loved ones care or they are in danger of harming themselves or others.How can my loved one authorize their doctor or therapist to share information with me?The first way your loved one can provide this authorization is in writing. This can be a note or a medical records release form that will be included in their files.The second way your loved one can provide authorization is by talking to their doctor directly. They may do this by speaking with their doctor on the phone or by discussing it in person during an appointment. This includes situations where the doctor or therapist asks your loved one directly for permission to share specific information with you and they agree, or tells your loved one that they plan to share this information with you and they do not object.Your loved ones doctor may also use their professional judgment and assume consent in specific situations. A situation where the doctor may assume consent is if youre accompanying your loved one at an appointment.Does my loved one have the ability to put restrictions on what information their doctor or therapist is permitted to share?Yes.

Proper management helps avoid complications from missed doses, incorrect usage, or medication interactions. It also supports caregivers in their vital role and enhances the overall quality of care for loved ones.The Role of Caregivers in Medication ManagementCaregivers often take on significant responsibilities in medication management, especially when their loved ones are unable to do so themselves. This role includes managing prescriptions, ensuring medication adherence, and coordinating with healthcare providers. Effective medication management helps in preventing health crises and supports the well-being of both the caregiver and their loved one.Key Statistics on Caregiver ResponsibilitiesAccording to a Caregiver Action Network (CAN) survey, 70% of caregivers are responsible for their loved ones medication management. This includes filling and refilling prescriptions, monitoring adherence, and handling medication side effects. These responsibilities highlight the critical role caregivers play in the health and safety of their loved ones.Understanding Medication ManagementEffectivemedication managementinvolves several key components, from filling prescriptions to ensuring medication adherence. Caregivers must be knowledgeable about the medications their loved one takes, including any special instructions or potential side effects. This comprehensive understanding helps in managing medications safely and effectively.Filling and Refilling PrescriptionsOne of the fundamental aspects of medication management isfilling and refilling prescriptions. This task requires careful attention to ensure that prescriptions are filled correctly and on time. Regularly checking medication supplies and scheduling refills can prevent interruptions in treatment and avoid complications.Ensuring Proper Medication AdherenceMedication adherenceis vital for the effectiveness of any treatment plan. Caregivers should monitor whether their loved one is taking their medication as prescribed. This includes following dosage instructions, taking medications at the correct times, and adhering to any dietary or activity restrictions associated with the medications.Communicating with Healthcare ProvidersEffective communication withhealthcare providersis essential for successful medication management. Caregivers should keep healthcare providers informed about any changes in the loved ones condition, medication side effects, or issues with adherence. This collaboration helps ensure that the treatment plan remains appropriate and effective.Safe Disposal of Unused MedicationsPropersafe disposal of unused medicationsis crucial to prevent accidental ingestion or misuse. Caregivers should follow recommended medication disposal guidelines, including using designated disposal programs or pharmacies that offer disposal services.Effective Communication StrategiesEffectivecommunication strategiesare key to managing medications successfully. Caregivers should engage in open and respectful discussions with their loved ones about their medication regimen. This includes addressing concerns, confirming medication schedules, and discussing any side effects or issues.Questions to Discuss with Your Loved OneWhen monitoring your loved ones medication, consider asking the following questions to ensure effective management:Side Effects:How have you been feeling since starting this medication? Have you experienced any side effects that need to be reported?Special Instructions:Are there any specific instructions for taking this medication, such as with or without food?Dosage Changes:Has the dosage of your medication changed recently? How should this be adjusted?Missed Doses:Have you missed any doses recently? If so, why, and what steps should be taken if this happens again?Addressing Side Effects and ConcernsIt is important toaddress side effects and concernspromptly. If your loved one experiences adverse effects from their medication, it is crucial to report these to their healthcare provider immediately. This helps adjust the treatment plan as necessary and ensures the safety and well-being of your loved one.Confirming Medication Schedules and MethodsConfirmingmedication schedules and methodsinvolves checking that your loved one follows the prescribed regimen accurately. This includes verifying the times of medication intake, ensuring the correct dosage, and reviewing any special instructions provided by their healthcare provider.Respecting Your Loved Ones AutonomyWhile caregivers play a significant role in medication management,respecting your loved ones autonomy is essential. If your loved one prefers to manage their medications independently, support them while providing guidance and assistance as needed.Balancing Support with IndependenceFinding the right balance betweensupport and independenceis key to effective caregiving. While it is important to assist your loved one with medication management, also respect their desire for autonomy and involve them in decisions about their treatment as much as possible.When to Involve Healthcare ProvidersThere are times wheninvolving healthcare providersis necessary, such as when significant issues arise with medication adherence, side effects, or changes in health status. Healthcare providers can offer professional advice and adjustments to the treatment plan to better suit your loved ones needs.Downloadable Medication GuideWe offer adownloadable medication guideto assistwith medication management.

Welcome to NFCAs Communicating Effectively with Healthcare Professionals program. NFCA educates, supports, empowers, and speaks up for millions of Americans who care for loved ones with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or the frailties of old age.NFCA addresses the common needs and concerns of all family caregivers, regardless of their loved ones age or diagnosis, in order to build their confidence and capabilities and help transform the quality of their lives. We are grateful to the National Association of Chain Drugstores Foundation and the Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation for sponsoring this OnDemand version of the Communicating Effectively program.We hope this presentation will help you appreciate the important role you play on your family members healthcare team. In addition, youll learn how good communication techniques can make a difference in the care your family member receives. Youll also learn strategies to better prepare for medical visits, whether in your physicians office or in the emergency room.As a family caregiver, you need to know that you are not alone. Rosalyn Carter said it best, There are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers. As the population continues to age, youll be hard-pressed to meet someone who doesnt know a family caregiver or is not one themselves.Poor communication with healthcare providers can cause mishaps or errors in treatment. For example, medication errors could lead to very serious consequences. In addition, opportunities for improving care can be missed due to problems with communication.The Communicating Effectively curriculum has been proven to change the way family caregivers behave in healthcare environments. Research indicates that caregivers are more confident in their communication interactions, and they change their behaviors in relation to preparing for medical visits, what they do during visits, and how they follow up. This curriculum promotes better healthcare outcomes for their family members and themselves.As a family caregiver, you are part of the healthcare team that cares for your loved one. In addition to you and your care recipient, other teammates include the primary care physician, nurses, pharmacists, medical specialists such as oncologists and hematologists, home healthcare aides, social workers, various therapists, and clergy. A whole network of individuals exists to assist you in caring for your family member.How can a family caregiver keep track of all these team members? One suggestion is to purchase a business card holder. As you interact with the caregiving team, you can collect their business cards, write on the back what their role is, and store them in the cardholder.On any team, there are various dynamics in relation to power. As a family caregiver, you have a special kind of poweryou know your family member better than anyone else on the healthcare team. Realizing your power is important because you have valuable information to share.Healthcare communication can be influenced by the relationship between the caregiver and their loved one. Its important not only to have clear and effective communication with healthcare professionals but also with your family member.The Communicating Effectively model is based on four key principles: establishing presence, participating actively, building mutual understanding, and encouraging collaboration. These strategies will improve your communication with healthcare providers and your overall ability to communicate with others.An important step in healthcare encounters is establishing presence. A person with presence might be seen as a force to be reckoned with or someone noticed by others. By staying in the moment, you remain calm and collected, allowing yourself to communicate your concerns and needs regarding your family members care.When you establish your presence, youre fully present mentally and physically. You can hear whats being said, process it, write it down, ask questions, and respond appropriately. These steps allow you to maintain a strong sense of self as an important and vital member of the healthcare team.When establishing your presence during a first meeting with a healthcare professional, you might want to shake hands and introduce yourself. For example: Hello, Dr. Smith. My name is Lori, and Im the daughter of Paul. He lives with me, and I am his primary caregiver. This statement lets them know your role and that you are an important part of your family members treatment.Rapport is also essential. Its important to participate actively in healthcare encounters, as research shows that patients who are more active in their care have better health outcomes. Being prepared, clearly stating your purpose, and writing down concerns are all part of this process.Ask questions, clarify incorrect assumptions, and be assertive. Skillful assertiveness will enhance your relationships and build understanding, while aggression can destroy relationships. Assertiveness helps you communicate your needs and concerns respectfully.Active listening involves paying attention to verbal and non-verbal cues like body language, tone, and facial expressions. It helps build mutual understanding and is a crucial component of effective communication.The Importance of Effective Healthcare CommunicationAs a caregiver, your role in your loved ones healthcare journey is pivotal. Effective communication with healthcare professionals can mean the difference between adequate and exceptional care. The Caregiver Action Network recognizes that caregivers are essential members of the healthcare team, with a unique perspective that can significantly impact medical outcomes. Here, we share tips for how to talk to your doctor as a loved ones caregiver.Why Good Communication with Healthcare Providers is CrucialPoor communication can lead to serious consequences, including:Medication errors that could harm your loved oneMissed opportunities for improved careMisunderstandings about treatment plansUnnecessary stress and anxiety for both caregiver and patientAs Rosalyn Carter famously said, There are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers. This profound statement underscores the universal importance of understanding healthcare communication.Key Strategies for Communicating with Healthcare Professionals1. Establish PresenceEstablishing presence means being fully mentally and physically present during healthcare encounters. This involves:Staying calm and collectedListening attentivelyProcessing information in real-timeTaking notesAsking meaningful questionsExample introduction: Hello, Dr. Smith. Im Lori, and Im the primary caregiver for my father, Paul. Im here to ensure we have a comprehensive understanding of his care.2. Participate ActivelyActive participation is key to improving healthcare outcomes. Research shows that patients and caregivers who engage more actively receive better care. Strategies include:Preparing questions before appointmentsBringing relevant medical documentsClarifying any misunderstandingsBeing assertive without being aggressive3. Build Mutual UnderstandingEffective communication relies on active listening. This means:Paying attention to verbal and non-verbal cuesObserving body language and toneAsking for clarification when neededRepeating information to confirm understanding4. Encourage CollaborationView yourself as a critical team member in your loved ones healthcare journey. Your team may include:Primary care physiciansNurses and specialistsPharmacistsHome healthcare aidesSocial workersPreparing for Successful Medical AppointmentsBefore the VisitCreate a comprehensive list of questionsGather recent medical recordsPrepare a concise summary of recent symptoms or changesConsider bringing a business card holder to collect contact information from healthcare team membersDuring the VisitStay focused and presentTake detailed notesAsk for explanations of medical termsConfirm understanding of treatment plansAfter the VisitReview your notesFollow up on any unresolved questionsOrganize and file medical documentsDiscuss the visit with your loved oneEmpowering Caregivers Through Effective CommunicationBy implementing these communication strategies on ow to talk to your doctor, caregivers can transform healthcare experiences.

Welcome to the National Family Caregivers Associations Safe and Sound program. NFCA is the nations leading organization for family caregivers, reaching across all life stages and diagnoses to address the common needs and concerns of caregivers. NFCA provides services and programs in education, community, and advocacy to help family caregivers improve the health and well-being of themselves and their loved ones.This presentation is designed to enable family caregivers to be effective members of their care recipients medication management team. It helps caregivers improve adherence to medication instructions, prevent problems from arising, and manage their own medication health as well. We are grateful to the National Association of Chain Drugstores Foundation for sponsoring this OnDemand version of the Safe and Sound program. We also thank the programs original supporters: Nardis Intel Health, eii Home Instead Senior Care, Pharma, Genworth Financial Health Services, and the Amera Group Foundation.We hope that after viewing this program, you will be able to identify the members of your medication safety team, understand when and where medication problems are likely to occur, and gain valuable safety tips to reduce the possibility of medication-related issues.People with chronic illnesses take more medications than anyone else. Medical professionals have a language all their own, and understanding some key terms can help you navigate medication management: **Medication adherence**: The extent to which patients take medications (both prescribed and over-the-counter) as instructed by healthcare providers. **Adverse drug reaction**: An unintended and negative reaction to a medication. **Medication error**: A preventable event that leads to patient harm or inappropriate medication use. **Medication reconciliation**: The act of reviewing all medications a patient is taking before prescribing a new one to avoid overlaps or negative interactions.This program will cover the who, what, where, when, and why of medication safety. As a family caregiver, you and the care recipient are important members of the medication management team. Other key members include doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, hospital staff, and case managers.When you have questions about medication, the team is there to help. Some essential questions to ask include: Should this medication be taken with or without food? Are there foods to avoid (e.g., grapefruit juice with certain medications)? How long should the medication be taken, and what happens if a dose is skipped? Is the medication affordable, and are there generic alternatives? What are the potential side effects, and what should be done if they occur?Pharmacists, who know more about medications than anyone else on the team, are valuable resources. Its also crucial to keep a comprehensive and updated medication list that includes all prescriptions, over-the-counter meds, and supplements. The list should include the medication name, dosage, purpose, and potential side effects. You can update this list with your pharmacy regularly.Use pillboxes, auto-refill programs, and tools like medication therapy management (MTM) to stay organized. Monitor your loved ones emotional health while taking medications, noting changes in mood, diet, or sleep habits that might indicate a problem. In case of an emergency or hospital visit, always bring a copy of the medication list and your care recipients patient record.Medication mishaps are more likely to occur during transitions of care or changes in health conditions. Using one pharmacy for all prescriptions helps streamline care and reduce confusion. Be proactive by asking questions, monitoring your loved one for reactions, and coordinating with healthcare providers to ensure proper medication management across settings.Remember, good health outcomes are three times more likely for patients who take medications correctly compared to those who dont. This program emphasizes the importance of your role in preventing medication mishaps and ensuring your loved ones safety. Thank you for viewing this presentation.Understanding Your Role in Medication ManagementFor family caregivers, managing medications for loved ones is one of the most critical responsibilities. Studies show thatproper medication managementcan triple the likelihood of positive health outcomes. As part of our commitment to supporting caregivers, Caregiver Action Network (formerly NFCA) presents the Safe and Sound: How to Prevent Medication Mishaps program, designed to empower caregivers with essential knowledge and practical strategies.The Foundation of Medication SafetyAs a family caregiver, you play a pivotal role in your loved ones medication management team. This responsibility extends beyond simply administering medications it involves understanding prescriptions, monitoring effects, and coordinating with healthcare providers to ensure optimal care. Effective medication management requires attention to detail, organization, and clear communication with all healthcare team members.Essential Medication Management TermsUnderstanding medical terminology helps caregivers communicate effectively with healthcare providers and prevent medication errors. Here are key terms every caregiver should know:Medication Adherence:Following medication instructions exactly as prescribed, including timing, dosage, and special requirements like taking with food.Adverse Drug Reaction:Any unexpected or harmful reaction to a medication, which may require immediate medical attention.Medication Error:Any preventable event that could lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm.Medication Reconciliation:The process of creating an accurate list of all medications, including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and supplements.Working with Your Healthcare TeamSuccessful medication management requires collaboration with various healthcare professionals:Primary Care Physicians and SpecialistsPharmacists Your most accessible medication expertsNurse Practitioners and Physician AssistantsCase Managers and Hospital StaffMaintain open communication with these professionals and dont hesitate to ask questions about:Medication timing and food interactionsGeneric alternatives and cost-saving optionsPotential side effects and warning signsEmergency protocols and missed dose proceduresPractical Medication Management StrategiesImplement these proven strategies to enhance medication safety:Create and maintain a comprehensive medication list, including:Medication names (both brand and generic)Dosages and schedulingPrescribing healthcare providersPurpose of each medicationKnown side effects or interactionsUse organizational tools:Pill organizers and medication reminder systemsAutomatic refill programsMedication therapy management (MTM) servicesDigital medication tracking appsPreventing Medication ErrorsBe especially vigilant during these high-risk situations:Transitions between care settings (hospital to home)Changes in health condition or treatment plansMultiple healthcare provider involvementNew medication introductionsMonitor your loved ones physical and emotional health closely when medications change, noting any variations in:Mood or behavior patternsSleep habitsAppetite or dietary changesPhysical symptoms or side effectsAdditional Support and ResourcesAccess these valuable resources to enhance your medication management skills:Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services through your pharmacyCaregiver support groups and educational programsDigital tools and medication management appsHealthcare provider educational materialsThis program is made possible through the support of theNational Association of Chain Drugstores Foundation, along with our partners: Nardis Intel Health, eiiHome Instead Senior Care,Pharma,Genworth Financial Health Services, and the Amera Group Foundation.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

While occasional feelings of sadness are normal,caregiver depressiongoes far beyond temporary emotional responses and requires proper understanding, recognition, and professional support.What is Caregiver Depression?Understanding Major Depression in CaregivingMajor depression is significantly more than experiencing sadness, unhappiness, or mood changes. While most people go through brief periods of these emotions, major depression in family caregivers is a serious mood disorder where feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with daily caregiving responsibilities and personal life for extended periods. This condition requires professional medical supervision and shouldnt be ignored or dismissed as just caregiver stress.What Caregiver Depression is NOTIts important to understand that major depression is distinct from:Mood changes induced by substances like drugs or alcoholSchizoaffective disorder and similar diagnosesNormal grief responses following the loss of a loved oneSigns and Symptoms of Depression in Family CaregiversFamily caregivers experiencing major depression typically show a combination of five or more of these symptoms persisting for at least two weeks:Persistent depressed mood and significant loss of interest or pleasure in most daily activitiesNotable changes in weight or appetiteSleep disturbances, including insomnia or excessive sleepingChronic fatigue and lack of energyOverwhelming feelings of hopelessness and helplessnessDeep feelings of worthlessness, self-hate, and inappropriate guiltSignificantly lowered self-esteemUnexpected outbursts of angerDifficulty thinking clearly, concentrating, or making decisionsRecurring thoughts about death or suicideTypes of Depression Affecting CaregiversDepression severity is typically classified as mild, moderate, or severe, with several distinct types that can affect family caregivers:Major DepressionThe most severe form, requiring five or more symptoms present for at least two weeks and typically continuing for six months or longer.Minor DepressionA less severe form where fewer than five depressive symptoms are present for at least two weeks.DysthymiaA chronic, generally milder form of depression that can persist for up to two years, affecting daily functioning and caregiving abilities.Atypical DepressionDepression accompanied by unusual symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, requiring specialized treatment approaches.Bipolar DisorderA condition where moods cycle between periods of mania and depression, presenting unique challenges for caregivers.Common Causes of Depression in Family CaregiversGenetic and Environmental FactorsDepression in caregivers typically results from a nature-nurture interaction, combining genetic predisposition with environmental stressors. Research shows that family caregivers who provide care for 36 or more hours weekly are significantly more likely to experience depression symptoms than non-caregivers.Risk FactorsSeveral factors increase a family caregivers susceptibility to depression:Managing care recipients with disruptive behaviorsDealing with personality changes caused by neurological conditionsExperiencing frequent conflicts with healthcare teamsLacking adequate social and emotional support systemsStatistical ImpactStudies reveal alarming statistics:Caregiving spouses experience depression symptoms at rates six times higher than non-caregiversThose caring for parents face twice the risk of developing depression compared to non-caregiversPersonal Stories: Family Caregivers Share Their ExperiencesMajor caregiver depression clicks in when I am experiencing three very stressful things at the same time, at least one of which is related to my being a family caregiver. To me depression is a thick dark menacing cloud that hovers over me wherever I go. The sky may be blue but this cloud is always with me. It is not high above but rather it hovers just a foot or so over my head, and it slowly moves downward until it is touching my head, forcing me to double over. I cant outrun it, or hide from it. It is always there, and at the worst times it continues to descend, getting darker and heavier all the time so that I am forced to my hands and knees and then flat on my stomach, but still it keeps coming, as if it is trying to push all the air out of my body.My depression looks and feels to me like a large and fierce-looking German shepherd. He sits at the foot of my bed and each time I try to get up, he growls and his eyes have a menacing stare, challenging me, as if to say If you put one foot on the floor I am going to leap up and tear you to bits.Depression to me was everything moving in slow motion. Just walking felt like I had shoes on that weighed tons, but because I have teenage children I had no choice but to keep moving and hold everything together.Recognizing and Addressing Caregiver DepressionSelf-AssessmentRegular monitoring of your mental health is crucial. Watch for:Persistent changes in mood and behaviorDisruptions in daily functioningChanges in sleep patternsLoss of interest in previously enjoyable activitiesGetting HelpIf you recognize signs of depression in yourself or another caregiver:Seek professional help immediatelyThe988 Suicide and Crisis Lifelineis a free, nationwide number that connects callers to trained counselors 24/7. Call or text 988 to reach the lifeline.Connect with support groups for family caregiversCommunicate with healthcare providers about your symptomsConsider counseling services specifically designed for caregiversDepression in family caregivers is a serious condition that requires attention and support. Understanding the signs, symptoms, and available resources is crucial for maintaining both caregiver and care recipient well-being. If youre experiencing symptoms of depression, remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2025, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Wandering may be due to stress or fear, boredom, or searching. They may wander off trying to fill a basic need, like hunger or a need to go to the bathroom. Sometimes they are reliving their former lives, believing that they are shopping or going to work. If you know why they wander off, you may be able to come up with a plan that helps to prevent it.There are strategies that you can use to help prevent wandering. First, have a routine. Having a plan for your day and activities will reduce the tendency to wander. Note if the wandering tends to happen at a particular time of the day; have activities planned for that time. Make sure that basic needs are met and that he or she has had enough to eat and drink and has been given the opportunity to go to the bathroom.Tips to prevent wandering:Secure the doors. Lock them (keeping locks out of eye level). Use signs like STOP! or DO NOT ENTER. Use alarms that go off when the door is opened. Use loosely fitting doorknob covers to make them difficult to open.Always have supervision. Never lock a person with dementia in a home alone.Camouflage doors by painting them to match the paint or wallpaper in the room or covering them with drapes.Fence in the yard and have a lockable gate.Keep things that signal travel out of sight. Hide shoes, car keys, luggage, coats and hats.Use a GPS device, like a watch, that your loved one can wear and let you know quickly where he or she is.Ensure a safe return:Notify local police and neighbors about your loved one with dementia and the tendency to wander. Ask them to notify you if the person is seen alone.Put labels in clothing that identify your loved one and give his or her address.Keep a recent close-up photo of your loved one to give to police or neighbors if your loved one is lost.For a small fee, theAlzheimers Association has a safe return program. You get an ID bracelet for your loved one and 24-hour support if he or she goes missing.Do not search for more than 15 minutes. Call 911 and tell them that a vulnerable adult, a person with Alzheimers disease is missing.Six out of 10 Alzheimers patients will wander. On average they do not wander more than 1.5 miles from home.Written by:Paul Varnas, DC, DACBN (Doctor of Chiropractic; Diplomate of the American Chiropractic Board of Nutrition).

It is important to try to allow your loved one to perform grooming tasks on their own, with your supervision as needed, for as long as they safely can. When your loved one can no longer properly groom themselves, use these tips to help them out.Tips for GroomingStick to a regular grooming routine. This is especially important if your loved one has dementia. Use your loved ones favorite toiletries, but make sure theyre safe and simple to use: for example, cardboard nail files are less threatening than metal nail clippers.Most people like having their hair washed regularly. Many people enjoy the feeling of having their hair washed and feel better when it is done. However, some people dont enjoy it at all. If frequent hair washing creates tension between you and the person you are caring for, consider the advantages of clean hair. Weigh these against the disadvantages of creating that tension.Going to the hairdresser or barber regularly gives your loved one a routine to stick to. This can be especially beneficial if its something theyve regularly done for a long time. Visiting the hairdresser routinely also prevents the need to wash their hair at home as frequently. Or find a hairdresser who will come to the house. This may be a time when you can have your hair cut too. Stick with haircuts that are easy for you and your loved one to maintain.If you are washing the persons hair yourself, a hand-held shower hose may work best. Think about using a shampoo that will not sting if it gets into the persons eyes. Alternatively, consider using a hair wash shield to prevent water from running onto the persons face. Another option is a no rinse shampoo that can clean the hair without using water.When it comes to assisting your loved one with hair removal, it is easiest and safest to use an electric razor. For hard to reach spots like the nose or ears, plucking normally works best.Its important to clip your loved ones fingernails and toenails regularly. This will prevent them from accidentally scratching themselves. Watch out for bunions, corns, or severe cracking when youre tending to your loved ones feet.A little makeup can go a long way. This may seem like an unnecessary luxury for your loved one.

From preparing for emergencies to managing long-term recovery, caregivers play a crucial role in ensuring their loved ones well-being. This guide provides essential strategies and resources to support you through each stage of stroke care, from emergency room visits to home recovery.Emergency Room Preparation for Stroke PatientsHave a Caregiver Go Bag ReadyPreparing a Go Bag can make your emergency room visit more manageable. Pack essential items such as a blanket, water, a power bar, a phone charger, and a book. Having these supplies ensures you are prepared for any situation during the emergency room visit.Be Prepared with the Right PaperworkBring all necessary documents, including your loved onesmedication list,patient file, and any relevant health information like theirBackpack Health info. This will help streamline the process and provide medical staff with crucial information.Tips for Talking to Medical StaffIntroduce Yourself:Let the medical staff know you are the family caregiver.Accurately Report Symptoms:Describe symptoms without making a diagnosis. For instance, say, My Dad seems to get extremely out of breath after walking even a very short distance, rather than, I think my Dad has pneumonia.Ask for Updates:Request updates on your loved ones condition regularly.Show Appreciation:Thank the medical team for their care and assistance.Hospital Care for Stroke SurvivorsEducate YourselfUnderstanding your loved ones condition and treatment options is vital. Research their diagnosis and ask questions about their care plan. Keep track of their test results, lab work, and any procedures performed.Talk to Your Loved One About Their GoalsDiscuss your loved ones health and recovery goals with them. Understanding their preferences and desired activities will help you align their care plan with their personal wishes.Observe Therapy SessionsAttend therapy sessions conducted in the hospital. Take notes on exercises and ask which ones should be continued at home to support ongoing recovery.Plan for DischargeStart planning for discharge early with the hospitals social worker or case manager. Ensure that discharge plans align with your loved ones goals and include recommendations for additional care providers such as therapists and home health aides. Ensure you have a home health care prescription if needed to cover services through Medicare.Home Safety for Stroke RecoveryDo a Safety Evaluation of the HomePrepare your home for your loved ones return by addressing potential hazards. Remove throw rugs, change light bulbs, and install grab bars. Consider modifications like installing ramps or special features in the bathroom to enhance accessibility and safety.Handle Medical AppointmentsSchedule follow-up appointments and discuss any symptoms or concerns with your loved ones healthcare providers. Determine if additional help, such as home health aides, is required and verify what outpatient care services are covered by your insurance.Build Your Support NetworkEngage with friends and family to build a support network. Seek out support groups and resources for caregivers to help manage emotional and practical challenges. For additional support, explore resources provided byCaregiver Action Network.Stroke Rehabilitation OptionsDecide on Rehab PlansChoose a rehabilitation plan based on your loved ones recovery goals. Options include self-managed care, nominal care, essential care, or comprehensive care. Discuss these options with healthcare providers to select the best approach for your loved ones needs.Keep a Journal of Your Loved Ones ProgressTrack your loved ones progress by documenting successes, challenges, and any new symptoms. Share these observations with doctors and other family members involved in the care.Recovery and the New NormalTake Care of YourselfPrioritize self-care by setting aside time each day for yourself. Attend support group meetings, seek help when needed, and explore respite care options to manage caregiver stress effectively.Understand the New NormalRecognize that both you and your loved one will need to adapt to new circumstances. Discuss any changes in mood or behavior with the healthcare team to identify if they are related to the stroke or indicate other issues.Watch for Warning SignsMonitor for symptoms such as muscle spasms, severe headaches, fatigue, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and heart palpitations. Report any concerning symptoms to the doctor immediately to ensure timely intervention.Additional ResourcesFor further information and support related to stroke caregiving, visit theCaregiver Action Network Help Deskfor guidance tailored to your needs and theCaregiver Action Network Community Facebook Groupfor caregiver support.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2025, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Day centers offer meals, snacks, and a variety of activities art, exercise, music, outings and the company of other people.Your loved one will likely enjoy meeting new people and will be pleasantly tired after a day or activities.While he or she is gone you can take a much-needed nap yourself!Timer for BedCreate a bedtime routine that helps your loved one prepare for a good nights sleep.Wind down at the end of the day by listening to soothing music or reading a poem or story. Make sure they use the toilet before pulling up the covers. Keep the bedroom at a comfortable temperature. Keep extra blankets handy in winter and a fan or air conditioner when the weather is warm. Install nightlights in the hall and bathroom to make it easy for your parent to find her way to the bathroom.Medications That Affect SleepPeople over 65 take more prescription and over-the-counter medications than any other age group, according to the National Institute on Aging.Its not unusual for an older person to take 14 or more different drugs each day. Side effects of both prescription and non-prescription medicines can affect sleep, especially in older adults.Some drugs may cause daytime drowsiness while others keep your relative wide awake at night.If your parent has trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at night or is drowsy during the day, ask the doctor or the pharmacist if her medicines could be affecting her sleep patterns. Alternative medications may be available that dont affect sleep.Medicines That Cause Drowsiness:Antihistamines for allergiesCertain blood pressure medicinesDiuretics water pills for high blood pressure and other diseasesAntidepressantsPain relievers or cough medicines containing codeineSome cold remedies and allergy productsTranquilizersCaffeine found in tea, coffee, certain soft drinks and medications that contain caffeine can keep your loved oneawake during the day and night.Limit their intake of caffeinated drinks during the day or substitute decaffeinated drinks.Alcoholic drinks can also affect sleep.Despite your best efforts, your loved one may still be unable to sleep.Their wakefulness may disturb the sleep of you and other family members.Ask the doctor if there are over-the-counter sleep medications that your loved one may use occasionally when he/she cant get to sleep. The doctor can recommend those that are most effective and have the fewest side effects.How Sleep Problems Affect CaregiversYour loved one wakes up during the night, confused and upset.They may be cold, confused or need to go to the bathroom. Youre tired from your daily round of caregiving chores and other activities but be patient and reassuring with them, lead them back to bed, tuck them in and see if you can find out whats bothering them.Remind yourself that your relative has an illness and they arent responsible for their behaviors and that you are now responsible for caring for them.This article is courtesy of Active Daily Living.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Most seniors experience at least mild dehydration regularly due to medication side effects and deliberately reducing fluid intake to avoid frequent bathroom trips or potential accidents.Dehydration in dementiapresents unique challenges that caregivers must understand. Unlike typical age-related dehydration risks, people with dementia face additional hurdles that significantly increase their vulnerability to this potentially dangerous condition.Understanding Dehydration in Dementia PatientsPersons with dementia face heightened dehydration risks because they progressively lose the ability to feel thirsty as their condition advances. This diminished thirst sensation, combined with cognitive limitations that prevent them from requesting drinks or remembering to hydrate themselves, creates a perfect storm fordehydration complications in Alzheimers disease.Research indicates thatkeeping dementia patients hydratedbecomes increasingly challenging as cognitive function declines. Memory loss affects their ability to maintain regular drinking habits, while communication difficulties prevent them from expressing thirst even when their bodies urgently need fluids.Serious Health Risks of Dehydration in ElderlyDehydration isnt merely uncomfortableit presents serious health concerns for seniors with dementia.Risks of dehydration in elderlyinclude increased susceptibility to:Falls and injuries due to dizzinessWorsening confusion and disorientationSevere constipation and digestive problemsUrinary tract infectionsRespiratory infectionsHospitalization (nearly one million older adults are hospitalized for dehydration annually)The combination of chronic mild dehydration and acute illness creates a dangerous situation where dehydration can rapidly escalate from mild to severe. Early identification and intervention are critical components of effectivedementia care hydrationmanagement.Recognizing Symptoms of Dehydration in DementiaCaregivers must remain vigilant forsigns of dehydration in elderlyloved ones, especially those with cognitive impairment. Common indicators include:Dry eyes, nose, and/or mouthDecreased urination (going 8+ hours without urination often signals dehydration)Smaller urine volume than usualElevated heart rate (100+ beats per minute)Unexplained weakness or fatigueIncreased confusion beyond typical baselineUnusual drowsiness or lethargyRecent unexplained weight lossThe more symptoms present, the greater the likelihood of significant dehydration. Creating a simple checklist of thesesymptoms of dehydration in dementiacan help caregivers monitor hydration status more effectively.Immediate Actions for Suspected DehydrationIf you believe someone with dementia is experiencing dehydration, your response should match the severity of their symptoms:For severe symptoms (extreme weakness, significant confusion increase, excessive sleepiness, or inability to drink), seek immediate medical attention. These signs may indicate dangerous dehydration requiring professional intervention.For mild dehydration without severe illness, implementelderly dehydration prevention strategiesby encouraging increased fluid intake while closely monitoring for improvement. Most individuals should aim for 4-6 cups of fluid daily, adjusting upward during hot weather or illness. For those with medical fluid restrictions, consult their physician about appropriatehydration for Alzheimers patientswith their specific condition.Effective Strategies for Preventing Dehydration in ElderlyImplementing proactivedementia care hydration tipscan significantly reduce dehydration risks:Establish a consistent hydration schedule with drinks offered regularly throughout the daynot just during mealsCreate enjoyable drinking routines like afternoon tea or a non-alcoholic happy hourEnsure drinks remain easily accessible at all timesExperiment with different drinking containers (sports bottles, cups with handles, straws) to discover preferencesFor advanced dementia, specialized hydration syringes can deliver fluid to the back of the mouth where swallowing reflexes remain activeMaintain a hydration log to track daily fluid intakeIncrease fluid offerings during hot weather, fever, or gastrointestinal illnessEncourage but never force fluidsRecommended Fluids for Dementia PatientsWhile water remains the ideal hydration source, variety significantly increases consumption likelihood. Effectivefluids for dementia patientsinclude:Water (consider adding lemon, cucumber, or fruit for flavor enhancement)Fruit juices (preferably diluted to reduce sugar content)Milk or plant-based milk alternativesNutritious smoothiesLow-sodium broths and soupsFor swallowing difficulties: popsicles, gelatin, pudding, or sherbetAdditionally, incorporatefoods high in water content for seniorslike watermelon, oranges, peaches, cucumbers, and many other fruits and vegetables that naturally contribute to hydration status.Be cautious with natural diuretics like coffee, caffeinated tea, sodas containing caffeine, and alcoholic beverages, as these can potentially worsen dehydration. However, if a morning coffee helps establish routine or a glass of wine enhances appetite, include these thoughtfully while ensuring abundant non-diuretic fluids throughout the day.For particularly resistant individuals, try implementing thesesafe drinking tips for seniors with dementia:Pair hydration with established routines like medication times or after bathroom visitsModel drinking behavior by joining them for beveragesOffer colorful drinks in transparent containers for visual appealConsider adaptive cups specifically designed for dementia patientsPreventing dehydration in elderlywith dementia requires vigilance, creativity, and persistence. Understanding the uniquecauses of dehydration in dementia patientslike diminished thirst sensation and cognitive barriers to self-hydrationenables caregivers to implement effective preventive strategies. By recognizing early warning signs and consistently applying thesehydration for Alzheimers patientstechniques, caregivers can significantly reduce hospitalization risks and improve quality of life.Remember that successfuldementia care hydrationinvolves balanceencouraging adequate fluid intake while respecting dignity and preferences. The goal isnt perfect adherence to arbitrary hydration targets but rather maintaining sufficient fluid balance to prevent complications while preserving comfort and quality of life. By implementing these strategies consistently,caregivers can make meaningful differencesin the health and wellbeing of those living with dementia.ByDr. Philip Sloane, Elizabeth and Oscar Goodwin Distinguished Professor of Family Medicine and Geriatrics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Thats a lot of meals. By the time youve reached late life, food may have lost some of its appeal. There are a variety of reasons why people lose their appetites as they age:Badly fitting dentures, gum disease, or dry mouth can make chewing difficult.Taste and smell senses diminish with age. Food doesnt taste as good as it used to.Side effects of medications for heart disease, constipation, depression, and other disorders affect appetite.People living alone dont like to fix meals just for themselves.Loneliness, sadness, depression, grief, and bereavement can all affect appetite.Food shopping and preparing meals are increasingly hard to do.Lack of physical activity.Constipation.Many older people cant eat much at one time and prefer snacking throughout the day instead of eating three meals. Stock the cupboard and refrigerator with lots of healthy, ready-to-eat snacks:Snack packs of pudding, jello, yogurt, cottage cheese, applesauce, and canned fruit.Single-serving cans of fruit or vegetable juice.Cheese and crackers with fresh fruit.Ice cream bars and popsicles are tempting when nothing else tastes good.Cut up raw vegetables with low-fat dip.Comfort Foods and Social TipsOld-fashioned comfort foods are easy to eat and bring back fond memories of earlier meals. Use favorite family recipes or carry-out from supermarkets and restaurants.Grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of soup for lunch or dinner.Macaroni and cheese.Meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.Rice pudding with raisins.If your family member hasAlzheimers diseaseor a similar memory disorder, try serving several small meals of a couple of favorite foods throughout the day instead of three big meals. Serve finger foods or sandwiches. Avoid foods that might cause choking: nuts, raw vegetables, popcorn,and small candies.Other non-food ways to improve a poor appetite:Invite a neighbor to share a sandwich and dessert with you and your relative.Eat your lunch together on the back porch.Ask your loved one to help prepare a meal with you.Take a walk together before a meal.This article is courtesy of Active Daily Living.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Now that you have a family member with dementia, you want to keep the kitchen as safe as it can be.Kitchen countertops and cabinets are filled with dangerous items poisonous cleaning products, sharp knives and scissors, and heavy pots and pans. You will need to secure the area by removing or locking up these items.As you install locks on your cabinets, you may want to do some research and find the best sort of lock. Locks made for childproofing are not recommended. Realize that as an adult, your loved one is much stronger than a child, and even with dementia still will probably be able to figure out the latch.An alternative option includes an invisible cabinet lock that opens using a magnetic key. This keeps the doors locked without making it obvious to your loved one that they are being locked out of a cupboard in their own home.Refrigerator SafetyAs your loved ones condition worsens, it may become necessary to lock the refrigerator. Sometimes people with Alzheimers disease will place non-food items in the refrigerator, such as a purse or keys.Your loved one may take items out of the refrigerator and accidentally leave them on the counter to spoil. They could also try to eat uncooked meat or other foods that can be harmful.If you are unable to deter your loved one from opening the refrigerator, you can install a refrigerator lock. Again, youll need one for adults, not for a child. It will need to be heavy-duty to withstand an adults strength.Oven And Stove SafetyThe oven and stove can pose the greatest threat to your loved one with dementia, as well as the rest of your family. Leaving stovetop burners on can lead to severe burns, fires, and smoke inhalation. There are easy fixes to help you and your loved ones stay safe.Remove all the knobs on the stovetop and place them in a drawer, or use safety knob covers.If your home has an electric oven or stove, a helpful product is the Automatic Stove/Oven Control. This device allows you to set your stove/oven to only be used during certain times of the day and to turn off when no one is in the kitchen. It has a countertop motion detector to monitor when people are in the kitchen.The safety device will turn the oven/stove off after a set amount of time, such as 5, 10, or 15 minutes. This will happen after the room is detected to be empty. If you are the one cooking and it is safe to leave the kitchen unattended, you can push an override button. This will allow the oven/stove to remain on beyond the set automatic shut-off time.Realize that your loved ones condition may cause them to forget how to use an appliance. This can cause your loved one frustration and present hazardous situations. Small appliances can cause hazards when used improperly. Unplug the toaster, coffee maker, and toaster oven when not in use. Or better still, remove them from the kitchen countertop. Consider disconnecting the garbage disposal or disguising the disposals switch.As your family members disease progresses, youll need to reassess the safety needs.This article is courtesy of Active Daily Living.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

However, if they have never owned a pair, they probably dont want to start now. Unless there is a medically indicated reason, refrain from imposing your personal preferences or styles onto your loved one.Allow your loved one to dress themselves as much as possible and only step in to assist when needed.It might take a little longer. However, it will help them retain a sense of independence and prevent the situation from becoming stressful or confrontational.If your loved one suffers from arthritis in their hands or is less nimble in their fingers, they may have trouble with buttons or zippers.You can replace clothing fasteners with larger buttons, bigger zipper tabs, or Velcro. This will enable your loved one to continue dressing independently for longer.Elastic waistbands make pants easier to put on. V-neck sweaters or a cardigan also are easier to slip on than a crewneck sweater.If your loved one has trouble with decision-making, rather than asking What do you want to wear today? give limited options, such as Do you want to wear the blue shirt or the yellow shirt today? (This also eliminates the option of not getting dressed at all.)Its always a little harder to put the second arm into a shirt or jacket, so be sure to start with your loved ones weaker arm and dress this arm first. That way, you avoid putting too much stress on the weak arm. When removing the shirt or jacket, start with the stronger arm, removing this arm first.If your loved one wears compression socks, there are some simple tricks to getting them on more easily. Put your hand into the sock until you touch the toe,then turn half of the sock inside out. Place the sock over your loved ones toe and slide the sock over the heel. Gently slide the rest of the sock up the leg until its in position. You may find its easier to get a grip on the sock if you wear rubber gloves. Put compression socks on in the morning when swelling is typically less. Legs should be dry. Compression stocking aids are available to help with this task.Visit here foressential tips on bathing for your loved ones.This article is courtesy of Active Daily Living.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Be open with your loved one about their bathing needs. If necessary, your loved ones doctor can help by stressing that they need help in this area. Ask your loved one their preferences of who they would like to have help them with bathing. If the task falls to you, here are ways to make the experience go smoothly. If you develop and stick to a routine, it should become less uncomfortable for both of you over time.Practical Tips for Bathing ComfortA daily full bath may not be in your loved ones best interest. Skin tends to become drier and more sensitive as we age. So a head-to-toe washing every day could do more harm than good. Instead, private areas and skin folds should be gently cleaned daily with a warm washcloth. Save the full baths for two or three times a week.Make sure the bathtub or shower can accommodate your loved ones level of balance and agility. Remove any items from the bathroom floor that could be a tripping hazard (including area rugs). Install grab bars in the tub or shower and get a shower seat if needed to help your loved one avoid falls. An inexpensive handheld hose for the tub or shower can make rinsing easier. If they are unable to step into a bathtub, consider using a transfer bench or sponge bath. Make sure the room is warm and test the temperature of the water before your loved one enters the bath.Prepare in advance all needed items for bathing:washcloths, towels, soap, and shampoo. If your loved one has favorite products that theyve always used, continue using those unless they become too harsh for sensitive skin.If you switch to a baby shampoo or sensitive skin formula soap, explain why.Allow your loved one some level of privacy when cleaning private areas. They can keep a towel on their lap throughout the bath which is only lifted as needed.If your loved one can handle a washcloth, encourage them to clean themselves. They can start by wiping down their arms.That simple action can help them retain a sense of independence and can help keep their mind off the more thorough washing youre giving them. Other distractions that may help include light conversation or playing their favorite music while they bathe.If you are giving your loved one sponge baths in their bed, there are no rinse soaps and shampoos available that make this task a little easier. Be aware, they will still need to rinse off occasionally to remove residue.Home care agencies can help with bathing.You may find the best option for you and your loved one is to handle the day-to-day washing yourselves. Have a home care aide come in a couple of times a week to take care of the more thorough bathing.This article is courtesy of Active Daily Living.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

While you want your loved one to have the comfort of living at home, you need to make sure the environment is safe too.The most dangerous room in the house is the bathroom. Consider hiring a professional contractor to help you make some adjustments. Install grab bars in the bathtub and by the toilet. It is not safe for someone to use a towel bar, shower door, or toilet for support. Grab bars are designed to hold a persons weight. Place non-skid strips on the tub bottom and have a non-skid rug or mat on the floor to prevent falls.Bathroom And Sinks SafetyInstall an automatic faucet control on the bathroom and kitchen sinks. This inexpensive device screws onto your current faucet. There is a small wand that descends from the faucet. If you make contact with the wand, you will turn the water on. Once you move your hand away, it releases the pressure from the wand and shuts off the water. This will enable your loved one to run the water without having to grasp the hot and cold water knobs.Since the faucet automatically turns off, you dont need to worry about leaving the water on accidentally. This prevents potential overflow in the sink.Shower SafetyAnotherdangeris your loved one burning themself in the shower. Although comfortable water temperature for showering is around 100 degrees, most home water heaters heat water up to 140-160 degrees. Scalding can occur when the water temperature is above 120 degrees. Due to thin skin, older adults are vulnerable to burns, and if they have advancing dementia, it may affect their ability to feel heat. Someone with cognitive impairment may not realize the water is too hot until the burn has occurred.Heater TemperatureOne way to prevent this is to reset the hot water heater to 120 degrees.You may hesitate to lower the hot water heater temperature because it could reduce the effectiveness of dishwashers and washing machines. Finding a balance is key to maintaining both safety and appliance efficiency.You can hire a plumber to install a scald-protection device or go to your local hardware store and purchase one you can attach yourself to the showerhead.You should also remove the mirrors in the bathroom. As dementia progresses, your loved one may see a stranger in the mirror when he or she does not recognize his or her own reflection. This can startle your loved one and cause them to fall.Take inventory of all toiletries in the bathroom. Lock up items such as rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover, soap, shampoo, perfume, and cleaning supplies for safety.You can buy inexpensive, yet effective, childproof locks for a bathroom cupboard.Taking these simple steps will help keep your loved one safe.This article is courtesy of Active Daily Living.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

Helping them move from their bed to a wheelchair also presents its own set of challenges. And if your loved one is resistant to being moved, it may be seemingly impossible. Here are some transfer tips to help you safely assist your loved one and minimize resistance.Make sure to give your loved one a fair warning that you are helping them move. The benefits of this are twofold.First, even with limited mobility, your loved one likely has some ability to help the transfer occur safely and smoothly. However, this is only possible if they are aware of the transfer.Two, involving your loved one in the process helps them retain some sense of independence and involvement in their care.Throughout the transfer process, give words of encouragement and gentle instruction. Be mindful that saying too many words may be confusing.Movement is crucial to prevent muscle atrophy and pressure sores due to immobility. However, excessive transfers can heighten safety risks and stress levels.Plan to limit the number of transfers needed.Think about the activities you and your loved one will engage in during the day. Plan out the transfers needed to make that schedule happen.Can any of them be avoided without reducing the quality of life?Assisting Older Adults with Safe TransfersBe aware of your limitations and avoid straining your back and joints while helping your loved one move. Make sure your feet are firmly planted shoulder-width apart, keep your back straight and knees bent.If the person has difficulty pushing up to stand, help them by having them wear a gait belt. Hold onto this as you help them stand rather than pulling up on your loved ones arms.If your loved one is able, ask for their help in leveraging themselves out of the bed or chair.Take your time. With each movementsuch as rolling onto their side in bed, sitting up, or if in a chair, moving to the front and planting their feet on the floortake a moment to make sure your loved one is not experiencing any dizziness or other difficulty. Once you have successfully helped your loved one out of the bed or chair and into a standing position, give them a moment to get their bearings, become stable, and avoid dizziness.Make the home environment lift-friendly. Any chairs used by your loved one should have a firm seat,and sturdy armrests that will provide leverage when they move to stand up. Make sure there is adequate room around the chair for you to maneuver while helping them stand up safely. Remove all area rugs and other tripping hazards from the home. Grab bars and transfer benches can help with transfers in and out of thebathtub.Handrails installed on the bed or in long corridors can also offer helpful transfer tips for safe movements throughout the home.This article is courtesy of Active Daily Living.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

My personal journey began in early 2017 when I first noticed unusual changes in my husbands behavior. By 2018, we received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) caused by Alzheimers diseasea moment that fundamentally transformed our lives.Watching an intelligent, capable man gradually lose his short-term memory has been heart-wrenching. Simple tasks that were once second naturemanaging finances, conducting household repairs, making decisionshave become increasingly challenging. Even choosing dinner, once a straightforward decision, now fluctuates unpredictably.The uncertainty is terrifying: Will he remember my name in six months? How long will this mild cognitive impairment stage last?Empowering MCI Patients Through Community SupportIn response to our diagnosis, I channeled my grief into action. In 2020, I initiated a support program designed to assist MCI patients in maximizing their cognitive abilities despite limited treatment options. Our weekly ninety-minute sessions have become a beacon of hope for those navigating this challenging diagnosis.Our program focuses on holistic cognitive health, incorporating:Memory-enhancing gamesPuzzle-solving activitiesPhysical exerciseNutritional educationWhat started with just six participants has now grown to fill two church rooms, with over 20 attendees joining weeklya testament to the critical need for community support in Alzheimers care.The Critical Challenge: Medicare and Alzheimers Treatment AccessThe landscape of Alzheimers treatment is rapidly evolving. By 2050, an estimated 13 million people will be affected by this devastating disease. Approximately 3,000 patients transition from MCI to more advanced stagesdaily. While an innovative early-stage Alzheimers drug recently received FDA approval, access remains a significant barrier.TheCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS) must address these access challenges. Current policies create unnecessary hurdles for patients seeking treatment:Requiring physicians to participate in CMS-approved registriesImplementing additional data collection stepsCreating uncertain review processesPotentially discouraging patient participation through complex requirementsThese barriers translate into real-world delays that can dramatically impact patient outcomes and family experiences.A Call for Compassionate Policy ChangeMy plea to CMS is simple yet urgent: treat Alzheimers medications with the same accessibility afforded to treatments for heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Time is not a luxury for Alzheimers patientsit is a precious, rapidly diminishing resource.While my husbands diagnosis came later in life, allowing us treasured moments like meeting our four grandchildren, many families face earlier, more aggressive progressions. Some patients might have mere months before the disease significantly impacts their quality of life.We need policy changes that prioritize patient access, reduce bureaucratic barriers, and recognize the critical importance of timely intervention. Although current treatments may not help my husband, they could provide hope and additional time for countless other families fighting this disease.By Ellen Steger, Caregiver AdvocateGreensboro, GAHelp SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2024, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

This is the story of Deborah, a Latinx woman who cared for her mother, who immigrated from Brazil. Deborahs mother was diagnosed with ALS in January 2020. She was given 2-5 years to live and passed away on March 27, 2022.What first led you to think something was wrong?In 2018, I noticed my Mom was having some cognitive issues and was constantly clearing her throat. In 2019, she started slurring her speech, leading to several specialist visits. A neurologist tested her muscle strength and found some weaknessand she had trouble making some of the sounds he requested. The pulmonologist tested her lung capacity and diaphragm strength and found some diaphragm weakness and scarring in her lungs from aspirating food. Thinking the problem was neuromuscular, the neurologist sent us to the University of Washington Medical Center to see neurologists with more experience with neuromuscular diseases.Getting a diagnosis was not easy. We visited multiple specialists in the UW system, but its very siloed, and the specialists we saw didnt talk to one another or share results. We had to keep repeating ourselves to people who had trouble seeing the whole picture. Meanwhile, Mom became incontinent and continued to exhibit cognitive issues, breathlessness with exertion, and gradually worsening speechalthough we could still understand her. In January 2020, after receiving the results of Moms first Electromyography (EMG), the UW neurologists concluded she had either PLS or ALS. We hoped for PLS because its a milder disease with a much longer prognosis. We switched to seeing the ALS Care Team at Virginia Mason (VM), where another neurologist did another EMG. The results and her examination led her to diagnose Mom with Bulbar ALS definitively.What went through your head when your Mom was finally diagnosed?When we got the diagnosis, there was relief and sadness. Because ALS is diagnosed primarily through elimination, it took over a year from first noticing symptoms to getting a formal diagnosis. While it was hard to hear Mom had ALS and only 2-5 years to live, I was relieved we finally knew what was going on and could do what was needed to help Mom, hopefully, slow down progression and live the best life possible.What are some of the challenges that youve encountered?There were many challenges:The long, arduous process of getting a diagnosisDoing the best for Mom despite her denial & firm faith/belief that she did not have ALS & that she would get better with prayerMom didnt want to let anyone outside the family know about the diagnosis, even though her close friends worried about her.Frontotemporal Dementia(FTD) compromised Moms decision-making. It made it challenging to get her to do what was best for her (e.g., not over-exercising, not eating foods that would choke her and be aspirated, getting enough sleep, etc.) FTD was also a blessing; Im convinced it kept her happier during the disease process than she would have been.The COVID-19 Pandemic prevented Mom from visiting with friends until we decided seeing them (in a safe way) was more valuable than the risk. It was hard to get Mom not to wear a mask even though it made breathing more difficult for her. Also, I had planned to cruise and travel with Mom while she could still walk and enjoy travel, and those plans died with COVID.An improperly placed feeding tube at the end of 2020 caused Mom so much pain and stress that the disease began progressing more rapidly.It was challenging having to do copious research to advocate for Mom and her quality of life.There were family disputes over grief-based differences in opinion about what Mom could still do safely and what she could not.Navigating the Challenges of ALS CareIt was difficult caregiving for someone who became unable to do most of the activities of daily living. Watching my mother sacrifice her dignity and self-determination to this disease was hard, although I tried to preserve it while keeping her safe.Also, and significantly, there is a lack of caregiving training available through the medical system. I had to research, watch YouTube videos, and have friends who are nurses show me how to do certain things for Mom, e.g., use and care for the feeding tube, modify liquids and foods for easier swallowing while preserving eating pleasure, use a gait belt correctly for transferring, bathe Mom safely with a shower chair, use a suction toothbrush and suction out mucous, alter clothing to make them easier to put on and take off, help her get up and down stairs, get the right mask for her non-invasive breathing machine to ensure comfort and avoid air leakage (this took going through 5 different masks)There is a lack of ALS-knowledgeable and ALS-skilled home help.There were unexpected aspects of palliative sedation.Whats something that you wish you had known before the diagnosis?I wish I had known that there were certified ALS clinics in Seattle, that Moms lead physician could be a palliative care physician, and that Caregiver Action Network existed.What has been the greatest source of support or help for you?My most significant source of support, first and foremost, is my amazing life partner. I could not have cared for Mom the way I did without his helpwhich was essential to Moms continued quality of life. My extended family was also helpful. We had weekly Zoom calls with Moms extended family, during which they gave her a lot of love and attention, and she was so happy. Those in the family who are in the medical field also helped advocate for Moms care.What did you miss most from before you were a caregiver?What I missed most was alone time with my life partner, better sleep, being able to do whatever I wanted/felt like doing, and, of course, a healthy and vibrant Mom.Whats something that you would like people who are not familiar with ALS to know?I would like people to know that although generalizations apply to most people with ALS, each persons experience is slightly different. Second, there are many ways to ensure your loved one with ALS has the best possible quality of life at every stage of this disease. ALS clinics are so important to people with ALS and their caregivers. Finally, no drugs or other cures are yet available that slow the progression or prevent death from ALS. ALS is a disease of little (and greater) deaths until the final death.What tips do you have for caregivers of a loved one with a serious disease?A tip I have for caregivers is that Palliative Care physicians are a crucial and infinitely valuable part of the care team for anyone with a chronic or fatal disease. Palliative sedation is mysterious even to the medical profession; they know the generalities, but the experience is unique to the individual. Also, hospice is not just for those who are imminently dying. It can be a big help in the last year(s) of life.My other big tipand really importantis that you should always be your or your loved ones advocate in the medical system. Dont take anything at face value. Doctors are human first. So, research, question, and challenge until you feel youre getting the care that your loved one deserves.How has your identity as Latinx impacted your role as a caregiver?The Brazilian culture places a significant value on family, including extended family, especially mothers. There is no way I would not have stepped in to care for Mom and ensured she could stay at home throughout her disease process and until she passed.Food is important to us, and Brazilian foods were part of Moms regular diet. Fortunately, we found some that were good when she could only eat soft, moist food. Other important parts of our culture are music and dancingwhich are as essential as breathing. We played music daily, and I danced with Mom even when she could only chair dance.Moms Catholic faith was strong and came from generations of matrilineal Catholics. Her faith sustained her, and I made sure she attended mass until she could no longer. I then arranged for her to receive pastoral visits from her priest and eucharistic ministers.Our large, loving, extended Brazilian family was present in Moms life throughout her illness, even when she was no longer conscious during palliative sedation. They also made sure I had what I needed without having to work.**If you are a caregiver for a loved one and would like to share your story, we would love to hear from you.

These are symptoms that include things like agitation, anxiety, elation, irritability, depression, apathy, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, and sleep or appetite changes.You know it when you see it. Your loved one might be constantly pacing. They might be verbally abusive. They might be throwing things. They might be seeing things that are not really there. They might have paranoid feelings that everyone is out to get them.Your Loved Ones SymptomsWhat are examples of these behavioral symptoms?What Is Agitation and Aggressive Behavior?What are hallucinations?What are delusions/paranoia?What causes this behavior?What else could it be?What are examples of these behavioral symptoms?We want to put certain behaviors on your caregiver radar so that you can recognize them as symptoms associated with dementiabehaviors such as agitation, delusions/paranoia, hallucinations, and aggression.These behaviors can be commonly associated with Alzheimers disease. But your loved one doesnt have to have Alzheimers to have these symptoms. There are other conditions that involve these same behaviors. These symptoms can occur in many types of dementias, including Alzheimers disease, Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinsons Disease Dementia, and Vascular Dementia.OK. So then what should I be looking for?Specifically, signs of agitation or instances of aggressive behavior.Whether your loved is experiencing hallucinations or delusions/paranoiaWhat Is Agitation and Aggressive Behavior?Agitation can be rapidchanges in mood, irritability, and outbursts.It can beexcessive motor activitylike pacing, rocking, gesturing, restlessness, and performing repetitious mannerisms.It can also beverbal aggressionsuch as yelling, speaking in an excessively loud voice, using profanity, screaming, and shouting.Or it can bephysical aggressionlike grabbing, shoving, pushing, resisting, hitting others, kicking objects or people, scratching, biting, throwing objects, hitting oneself, and destroying property.The behavior has been persistent or frequent for a minimum of two weeks and represents a change from your loved ones usual behavior(and is not related to some other medical condition such as delirium, pain, effects of a medication, or infection such as a urinary tract infection.).What are hallucinations?Hallucinations are any sensations of something that does not actually exist in reality.Many people think hallucinations are only visualseeing something that is not really there. But in fact, hallucinations can involve any or all the five sensessight, smell, taste, touch, and sound.While people with dementia can experience hallucinations of any of the five senses,visual hallucinations are the most common.People can experience hallucinations at any point in the progression of dementia, from early in the disease cycle to later in the disease cycle.Some common hallucinations are: seeing strangers whos that man in the living room?; hearing things someone is talking outside of the bedroom; and seeing deceased relativesmy mother is sitting in that chair.What are delusions/paranoia?Delusions are fixed ideas about something that is not true.Some examples ofcommon delusionsare:theftthey are stealing my things;abandonmentyou never come to see me, are yougoing to leave me?;spousal infidelityyoure having an affair; andreferencethey are talking about me in the news again.What causes this behavior?These behaviors are simply a part of the dementia. No, your loved one is not going crazy. Their behavior is just a result of the underlying medical condition.Sure, the symptoms might be embarrassing, difficult to deal with, even on rare occasions dangerousbut they are symptoms of an illness just like any other medical condition.Andthese behaviors are not at all uncommon.Of the 8 million Americans with dementia, 75% of them will experience these symptoms during the course of the disease.What else could it be?Actually, there are a lot of things other than dementia that can cause symptoms like agitation, hallucinations, and delusions.Certainmedicationscan cause these symptoms.Certainmedical conditionscan cause them, too, such as narcolepsy and other sleep disorders, and mental conditions such as schizophrenia. Even common conditions like urinary tract infections can cause these symptoms.Grief or emotional traumacan cause symptoms. Even excessive exercise has been known to spark symptoms.If your loved one abusesdrugs or alcoholor is going through recovery, you might see these symptoms.Covid-19can cause symptoms such as olfactory hallucinations (smelling things that arent there.)What Should I Tell the DoctorAbout hallucinations andneuropsychiatric/behavioral dementia?Hallucinationsand anyother symptoms of neuropsychiatric/behavioral dementia: such as aggression, agitation, delusions, or paranoiashould be reported to your loved ones doctor so he/she can determine the cause.Because symptoms such as agitation, aggressive behavior, and hallucinations can be the result of different causes, it is important that you describe the symptoms asaccurately and fullyas you can to the doctor.You will want to tell the doctor:what the symptoms arehow often they occurhow long they have been happeningif they are changing in severityif there are any triggers you observe that seem to bring on the symptoms.Remember that these symptoms can occur at any time during the stages of dementianot just in the later stages of dementia.But why bother? Can we actually do anything about these behaviors?These behavioral and psychological changes in dementiapose challengesand canincrease the progressioninto a more severe declinewhich is why it is important to tell the doctor when these symptoms happen.These behaviors can certainly be very hard for you as a caregiver to handle and can easily lead to burnout and stress.Many family caregivers think these behaviors are just part of dementia and shrug their shoulders, thinking that nothing can be done about them.The fact is, more can be done to deal with these behaviors than you might think. Your loved ones behavior issomething that can be dealt with, not justsomething to endure.When I talk to the doctor, what will the doctor do?The doctor will first try to determine if the symptoms are associated with dementia. The doctor will want to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. As some doctors say, properly addressing issues of toileting, pain, and nutrition can help resolve symptoms like anxiety and aggression in many cases.If the doctor does determine that the symptoms are part of your loved ones dementia, there are several approaches the doctor might take.The doctor might want to start with any number of non-pharmacological approaches to treatment before considering medication. Non-pharmacological approaches can include music therapy, aromatherapy, and many others. These therapies can be very effective in many cases.The doctor might decide medications are necessary.Medications may help address some of these symptoms. Talk to your doctor about which type of medications may be right for your loved one. It is important to understand the potential side effects of medications.I'm not sure I want my loved one on even more medications. Is there an alternative?There are several therapies that do not involve medications. In fact, your loved ones doctor may start thesenon-pharmacological therapiesfirst before prescribing a medication.These include music therapy, aromatherapy, bright light therapy, massage, and exercise.Will medications just sedate the patient and knock them out? Or can medications actually help treat the symptoms?Some medications, such asbenzodiazepines, can be sedating without much efficacy in addressing the symptoms.Antipsychoticscan be sedating but can help resolve some symptoms is some patients. Doctors may prescribe antipsychotics for short-term use.New therapies are being studied to specifically address the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Hopefully, there will be FDA approved medicines soon.What other healthcare professionals besides my loved ones doctor are involved?In addition to your loved ones primary care provider, any number of other health care professionals might be involved with your loved ones care.These can include psychiatrists, neurologists, geriatricians, pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, or case managers. Each have their own expertise.Keep in mind that other health care professionals besides the primary care doctor can be very helpful in addressing your loved ones behavioral symptoms. For example, geriatric psychiatrists and geriatric nurses have a great deal of helpful expertise and are accustomed to interacting with family caregivers. Ask your loved ones primary care doctor if there is a geriatric psychiatrist or geriatric nurse that they can refer you to.What Can I Do At Home to Help?Upgrade & Improve Environment & HomeCreate a soothing environment.Decrease noise. Decrease brightness.Remove any objects that tend to trigger the behavior.Be aware of whether mirrored surfaces or poor lighting that causes shadows contribute to your loved ones hallucinations, and if so, remove those, too.Pay close attentionto the toileting, pain, and nutrition needs of your loved one. Being uncomfortable especially if your loved one cannot communicate their discomfort can trigger these behaviors.Validate your loved ones feelings.After all, the fear or anger or other emotions they feel are very real.Reassure your loved one that you are there to protect them.Distraction,distraction, distraction! Trying to distract your loved one is your best strategy.Change the subject.Take your loved one for a walk.Play a game or work a puzzle.Sing a favorite song.Listen to musicShould I try to convince my loved one that their hallucinations or delusions are not real?Probably not. Telling your loved one that they are wrong and arguing with them about it is likely just to aggravate your loved one even more.Some health professionals say, if it causes no harm to you or your loved one, the best approach is to just go along with it.You can acknowledge and validate your loved ones feelings without trying to convince your loved one that what they are feeling or experiencing is not true.This is Hard. Can I handle it? What can help me from going crazy handling all this?Emotional & Physical Stress & Risk for DepressionFamily caregivers of people with dementia can experience high rates ofemotional and physical stress.The burden of caring for a loved one with dementia is one of the major reasons family caregivers consider placing their loved ones in long-term care.Because of the stress of your role as a family caregiver, you might be atincreased risk for depressionas well as an increased likelihood of conditions such ashigh blood pressure.So it is critical that you take care of yourself so that you can stay strong enough to care for your loved one.Get rest when you can.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) covers the vast majority of FDA-approved medical services, therapies, and equipment.When CMS denies Medicare coverage of FDA-approved drugs, patients and their family caregivers lose.What is an NCD?A national coverage determination (NCD) is a Medicare coverage policy that explains the conditions for CMS coverage for specific items and services that are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. NCDs limit access by specifying eligible patients, healthcare providers, and other conditions that must be met. NCDs are especially rare for FDA-approved drugs, which have only been subjectedto the process a handful of times. Even when CMS has issued NCDs for therapeutics, the agency hasalmostalwaysprovided coverage according to a drugs label.What is a CED?Coverage with Evidence Development (CED) is a coverage policy CMS can impose within the context of an NCD that further restricts coverage (i.e., requiring beneficiaries be enrolled in a CMS- approved clinical study or a patient registry to receive coverage.)Of the hundreds ofNCDsfrom 2005-2021,only 26require CED.CMS has utilized CEDs almost exclusively for medical devices because clinical evidence is often limited at the time of launch and long-term effectiveness depends on how they are adopted.According to CMS, CED is intended to expedite access to innovative new therapies while additional evidence is collected. AsCMS explains, this process is not intended to duplicate or replace the FDAs authority in assuring safety [and] efficacy, as the FDA approval process is extremely rigorous.For patients and their family caergivers, CED for an FDA approved drog often seems duplicative, leads to confusion, and undermines confidence in the FDA approval process.CED can have several unintended consequences, including:Limiting patient accessLimiting the type of patients who may benefit from a certain type of treatment, diagnostic tool, or therapy, means that many others will not have access. Family caregivers top priority is to ensure that their loved ones have access to all tools and therapies they need.Threatening R&DThe time and money required to put a drug through the FDA-approval process is significant. If CMS requires additional databeyond ongoing reporting commitments to FDAas a condition for coverage, research and investment incentives will be reduced.Increasing CostsAreviewof CEDs found that CMS does not directly fund the clinical research detailed in NCDs, therefore public and private funding streams are required to develop and conduct the research in question.Extending treatment delays for patientsOne expert explained that, for CED, generally, a maximum of four years until study completion and final decision seems to distinguish successful from unsuccessful cases.For most disease states, timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to help ensure timely, effective treatment.Unclear or confusing data requirementsCurrently, data collection mechanisms are designed and implemented without a specific timeline for coverage reconsideration. This is exemplified by the lengthy and widely varying program duration for the three out of 26 programs with retired data collection requirements (4 to 12 years) and the long duration of the two CED programs resulting in NCD revocation (10 and 13 years) since 2005.Increasing Health InequitiesCEDs could add to the significant health equity gaps for rural and underserved communities, and people of color. Participants in approved studies may receive better treatment than those not participating, and treatments likely will not be available in all geographical areas. A recentAvalere analysisprovides a detailed look at the health equity issue.Ethical IssuesVariousstakeholdershave questioned whether it is ethical to restrict access to FDA-approved therapies to patients participating in registries and clinical trials while withholding coverage for others. Patients and caregivers must weigh a lot of factors in order to determine whether a clinical study is right for them. Further, when CMS requires randomized control trials, there is a risk that patients will receive placebo.HowCanCMSBetterHelpPatientsandCaregivers?Clearly articulating a pathway to coverage.Utilizing a fit-for-purpose data collection process that is designed to answer specific, necessary questions.Reducing health equity gaps by allowing flexibility for all appropriate providers to participate, even if entities have minimal data infrastructure capabilities.Clearly defining the time limits or stopping rules to ensure that patients arent waiting for decades for treatments.Medicare coverage plays a vital role in supporting family caregivers and their loved ones. By understanding current policies and advocating for improvements, caregivers can help create a more supportive healthcare system. As policies continue to evolve, its crucial to maintain focus on reducing caregiver burden and ensuring access to necessary medical care and support services.Help SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2025, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

As you transition from caregiver to your next chapter, take time to reconnect with the different parts of yourselfwhether as a friend, professional, artist, or whatever roles matter to you.Building a Support NetworkPost-caregiving support is crucial for healing and moving forward. Consider:Reaching out to family and friends you may have lost touch withJoining caregiver support groups specifically for those in transitionConnecting with grief counselors or therapists who specialize in caregiver supportParticipating in online communities for former caregiversExploring New Opportunities After CaregivingProfessional TransitionsSome former caregivers find meaning in transitioning from family caregiver to professional caregiver.

Innovative treatments aimed at slowing disease progression showed the most encouraging results yet in a clinical trial. These developments offer hope for those affected by Alzheimers disease and their families. Unfortunately, accessing these treatments may be challenging for patients due to a hurdle imposed by the Biden Administration. In many cases, Medicare wont cover the new treatments unless patients meet strict eligibility criteria. This presents a significant barrier for patients seeking these potentially beneficial treatments. As new science and data show us whats possible, our elected leaders need to take notice and act.Approximately11 million Americansare providing unpaid care for their loved ones with Alzheimers disease. Caregiving presents daily physical and emotional challenges; and it takes a huge toll on careers, relationships, and family life. These family caregivers are juggling work with their caregiving responsibilities and logging more than 15 billion hours of caregiving annually. In Massachusetts, 284,000family caregiversprovide more than 411 million hours of unpaid care, estimated to be valued at $48.7 billion annually.Toll of Alzheimers Caregiving and the Pandemics ImpactAs people living with Alzheimers experience cognitive decline, caring for them becomes increasingly challenging. This situation takes a significant toll on their caregivers emotional and physical well-being. Caregivers for Alzheimers patients reportdisproportionately higher ratesof stress and depression. They have an increased risk for heart disease and stroke; they suffer higher mortality rates than the general population; and they must spend about $5,000 more than the average person on their own annual health care costs.The pandemic made caregiving more difficult for millions of Americans. Arecent studyfrom the University of Michigan found that more than half of Americans 50 years and older are caregivers to one or more people, 65 years or older. Younger families feel the brunt too. Twenty-five percent of Gen Z and Millennial caregivers were in caregiving roles for the first time during the pandemic. Overall, 20 percent of caregivers surveyed were new to caregiving, and 60 percent of them were Gen Z or Millennials.Medicare limits access to new Alzheimers treatmentsThe worst part, until recently, is that patients diagnosed with Alzheimers had no treatment options. Despite extensive research and a substantial investment of time and money in Alzheimers research. Alzheimers disease remains one of the leading causes of death. Its impact underscores the urgent need for continued research and effective treatments.New therapies targeting the buildup of amyloid plaque in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimers disease, have shown promising results. These therapies represent a significant advancement in the fight against Alzheimers. They offer hope for potential breakthroughs in treating and managing this devastating disease. One was approved by the FDA last June.Despite FDA approval, CMS decided to restrict access to new Alzheimers therapies. The restrictions apply not only to current but also to future treatments. This decision affects who can benefit from these advancements in Alzheimers treatment.This action should concern all of us. CMS is setting a disturbing precedent for millions of patients and their caregiverMedicare limits access to new treatments to those in clinical trials or registries. This requirement imposes burdens on patients and physicians. Accessing these treatments through Medicare involves a complex, time-consuming process. This will undoubtedly lead to most Alzheimers patients and future caregivers being left behind.Alzheimers Treatments Will Cause Long-Term HarmThis decision will have widespread repercussions across the healthcare system. It threatens the development of future treatments for rare and chronic diseases. These conditions affect tens of millions of patients and families.Medical science progresses in gradual phases rarely is a miracle cure ever developed at once. Approving and covering promising treatments now is crucial. It ensures ongoing development of new and improved treatments in the future. Limiting access to Alzheimers therapies signals a lack of interest in treatment development. This stance may hinder future advancements in Alzheimers treatment.As the new Congress is sworn in and we approach 2023, policymakers must recognize that CMSs decision to limit coverage for Alzheimers treatments will cause more long-term harm than good. Patients living with the disease today will continue their decline, family and caregivers will see their quality of life continue to erode, and we will have arrested future progress towards the development of new treatments that can bring new hope.We need smart decision making on the part of policymakers and we need them soon.

These include long-term care policies, tax credits, and reimbursements for family caregiving expenses.Getting paid for caring for a loved one with VA benefitsIf your loved one is a veteran of the U.S. military, there are four plans for which they might qualify. VA benefits change periodically, so checking for updates is always a good idea. It is important to stay informed about the latest VA benefits for caregivers.Veteran-Directed Careis a program through the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans who are enrolled in a Veterans Health Administration healthcare system and need nursing care but want to live at home. Participants are given a monthly budget and can choose the goods and services most helpful to them. This includes a caregiver to assist them with activities of daily living tailored to their specific needs.Aid and Attendance(A&A) benefits support veterans who qualify for a VA pension, having served on active duty for at least 90 days during a time of war and received an honorable discharge. Veterans must meet one of these criteria: require assistance with daily activities, be confined to bed due to a disability, have minimal eyesight, or live in a nursing home due to a physical or mental incapacity.Veteran Caregiver Benefits: Housebound & Assistance ProgramsHousebound benefitsare for veterans receiving a military pension who are housebound due to a permanent disability. Please note that under this program, adult children and other relatives can become paid caregivers for family members. However, this program does not allow spouses to be paid caregivers for their family members. The application is the same as for A&A benefitsbut you cannot receive both simultaneously.TheProgram of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregiversis for caregivers of veterans who need help with activities of daily living due to an injury or illness sustained in the line of duty on or before May 7, 1975, or on or after September 11, 2001. To be eligible, veterans must meet certain disability and need criteria. Stipends are based on the federal pay rate for where the veteran lives. Under this program, the caregiver must be 18 years or older and can be a spouse.For more information on caregiver benefits for veterans, visit theVA Caregiver Support pageor call its hotline at 855-260-3274.Getting paid to be a family caregiver through MedicaidMedicaid is a federally funded state program that assists with healthcare costs for people with limited income. It covers low-income adults, older adults, and individuals with significant disabilities across the United States. This may be a good time to mention that Medicaid and Medicare are different programs.To be eligible for Medicaid, your loved one must meet one of the following criteria:Be considered low-income according to the guidelines in the state where they have established residence. To qualify, one must make around 138% of the poverty limit or lower.Be considered medically needymeaning that their health needs are intensive and may require overwhelming expense.Medicaid in some states allows older adults to choose and pay their caregivers, including adult children or spouses. This flexibility varies by state, offering options for individuals needing caregiving support through Medicaid plans.Home and community-based waivershelp older adults who would rather receive in-home care. Qualifications vary by state; generally, older adults must require care provided by skilled nursing or assisted living facilities. To qualify, there must be a care plan, and in-home care costs cannot exceed residential care costs.Self-Directed Care Programs for Seniors and Medicaid OptionsSelf-directed person assistant servicesallow seniors to hire caregiversusually family members or close friends. Under the program, the participant must develop a care plan with the caregiver and establish a backup plan if the selected caregiver can no longer continue in their caregiver role.Community First Choiceis similar to the other Medicaid programs. Under the plan, seniors can manage their own careincluding paying family or friends for their caregiving services. This plan was established under the Affordable Care Act and is available in nine states: AK, CA, CT, MD, MT, NY, OR, TX, and WA.For more information on Medicaid, go to:https://www.medicaid.gov/.Getting paid for caregiving for a parent through tax credits and reimbursementsThere are several tax credits and reimbursements available for caregivers. If your parents gross annual incomenot including society securityis less than $4,300 and you cover more than half the support cost, claiming them as a dependent may be possible. Even if these criteria dont apply, deducting the majority of care expenses from your taxes might be possible. It would be best if you were sure to consult an accountant or tax attorney. The regulations vary by state, and some state-funded caregiver payment programs do not allow family members to claim their elderly loved ones as dependents on their taxes. These options may not be financially beneficial for you in the long run.Getting paid for caregiving by your loved oneOne possible way for your loved one to pay you for caregiving is if they have long-term care insurance. Policies vary by company, but many long-term care policies allow payment for in-home caregiving. The insurance company can tell you if a family member can provide this care.Another option is if your loved one is of sound mind and financially capable, they can pay you directly. Consider drafting a personal care contract outlining compensation and caregiving services. You may want to include other immediate family members in the discussion to avoid surprises or misunderstandings later.You should also consult an elder care attorney to ensure the contract complies with tax laws. Any compensation received is considered income and should be reported on your taxes. Suppose your loved one is currently on Medicaid or may be in the future. In that case, you want to ensure that any payments made to you dont violate their eligibility requirements or Medicaid regulations. Other interested parties, such as siblings, should also approve the agreement. This could help avoid any hurt feelings or disagreements regarding issues of inheritance.Additional Financial & Legal ToolsHow to Become a Paid Family CaregiverRead MoreMedicare Help Senior Patients and Caregivers for DecadesRead MoreWhy Medicare Coverage is Critical to CaregiversRead MoreFinancial Help for Caregivers: SilverBills Partnership and NIH StudyRead More12NextLoad More PostsHelp SupportCaregiversAcross the Nation1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgClick to Call Caregiver Help Desk: (855) 227-3640Quick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic PolicydonateCelebrate the passion and devotion of caregivers!Donate TodaynewsletterSign up for caregiving insights from us:Name(Required)FirstLastEmail(Required)Tell us about yourself(Required)Tell us about yourselfFamily CaregiverFormer CaregiverOtherHelp Support Caregivers Across the NationQuick LinksCaregiver Help DeskLend Your VoiceCorporate PartnersSpeaker RequestsPublic Policy1150 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 501, Washington, DCinfo@caregiveraction.orgHelp Desk: (855) 227-3640Copyright 2025, National Family Caregivers Association DBA Caregiver Action Network.

One effective strategy is to focus on being present with your loved one, even when things feel beyond your control. Engaging in activities that you both enjoy can help strengthen your bond and create more peaceful moments during stressful times.Some great activities for caregivers and their loved ones include cooking, gardening, crafting, playing games, reading, or light exercise. These shared experiences can bring you closer and help reduce emotional strain.Staying OrganizedBeing organized is essential for successful caregiving.
